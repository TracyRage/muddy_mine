The G+C content of DNA of strain AMV16(T) was 50.9 mol%. blast sequence similarity searches based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that species of the genus Marivirga were the nearest phylogenetic neighbours, with pairwise sequence similarity ranging from 89.9 to 90.0 %. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain AMV16(T) clustered with the type strains of Marivirga tractuosa and Marivirga sericea at a phylogenetic distance of 14.6 % (85.4 % similarity), distinct from clades representing other genera of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae'.

Transcript analysis revealed that members of the deltaproteobacterial groups Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) and Desulfobulbaceae (DSB) exhibit increased rRNA expression in incubations with methane, suggestive of ANME-coupled activity. Direct analysis of anabolic activity in DSS cells in consortia with ANME by FISH-NanoSIMS confirmed their dependence on methanotrophy, with no 15NH4+ assimilation detected without methane. In contrast, DSS and DSB cells found physically independent of ANME (i.e., single cells) were anabolically active in incubations both with and without methane. These single cells therefore comprise an active ‘free-living’ population, and are not dependent on methane or ANME activity. We investigated the possibility of N2 fixation by seep Deltaproteobacteria and detected nifH transcripts closely related to those of cultured diazotrophic Deltaproteobacteria. However, nifH expression was methane-dependent. 15N2 incorporation was not observed in single DSS cells, but was detected in single DSB cells. Interestingly, 15N2 incorporation in single DSB cells was methane-dependent, raising the possibility that DSB cells acquired reduced 15N products from diazotrophic ANME while spatially coupled, and then subsequently dissociated. With this combined data set we address several outstanding questions in methane seep microbial ecosystems and highlight the benefit of measuring microbial activity in the context of spatial associations.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4817681", "pubmed_id": "26394007", "doi": "10.1038/ismej.2015.145", "venue": "The ISME Journal", "journal": "The ISME Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2177136135", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["85766650", "4675942", "55741975", "39346085", "205009562", "16981756", "206891957", "351828", "15428743", "350655", "87681160", "6847856", "7024412", "6623841", "31107045", "129246626", "7925244", "11607332", "18367182", "10635387", "205528070", "140639772", "14748147", "26691288", "35304652", "11767206", "6467121", "17345139", "10164197", "21314529", "32356495", "818482", "32580835", "2985303", "24798292", "9491607", "4430700", "56404372", "28333410", "9454067", "17173492", "20216107", "640679", "10667400", "9696817", "20448290", "41852456", "16088459", "23169780", "22340746", "206892153", "3789483", "22725659", "11293796"], "inbound_citations": ["215321862", "203641443", "49646642", "209377476", "49559285", "9024353", "209897393", "215323764", "196665735", "3890655", "56279253", "3469821", "215456076", "67863935", "195804574"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20023799"}

None of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from these samples were closely related to sequences of known neutrophilic aerobic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. The sediments below both types of mats showed relatively high sulfate reduction rates (300 nmol x cm(-3) x day(-1)) partially fueled by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (10 to 20 nmol x cm(-3) x day(-1)). Free sulfide produced below the white mat was depleted by sulfide oxidation within the mat itself. Below the orange mat free Fe(II) reached the surface layer and was depleted in part by microbial Fe(II) oxidation.

High partial pressure of dissolved gasses plays an important role in microbial metabolism, because thermodynamic feasibility of many reactions depends on the concentration of reactants. For gases, this is controlled by their partial pressure, which can exceed one MPa at in-situ conditions. Therefore, high hydrostatic pressure alone is not sufficient to recreate true deep subsurface in-situ conditions, but the partial pressure of dissolved gasses has to be controlled as well. We developed an incubation system that allows for incubations at hydrostatic pressure up to 60 MPa, temperatures up to 120° C and at high gas partial pressure. The composition and partial pressure of gasses can be manipulated during the experiment. The system is mainly made from off-the-shelf components with only very few custom-made parts. A flexible and inert PVDF incubator sleeve, which is almost impermeable for gases, holds the sample and separates it from the pressure fluid. The flexibility of the incubator sleeve allows for sub-sampling of the medium without loss of pressure. Experiments can be run in both static and flow through mode. The incubation system described here is usable for versatile purposes, not only the incubation of microorganisms and determination of growth rates, but also for chemical degradation or extraction experiments under high gas saturation, e.g. fluid-gas-rock-interactions in relation to carbon dioxide sequestration. As an application of the system we extracted organic acids from sub-bituminous coal using H2O as well as a H2O-CO2 mixture at elevated temperature (90°C) and pressure (5 MPa). Subsamples were taken during the incubation and analysed by ion chromatography. Furthermore we demonstrated the applicability of the system for studies of microbial activity, using samples from the Isis mud volcano.

Samples were collected from the active peak craters at a depth of 20 cm and DNA was immediately extracted and amplified with universal 16S rRNA gene-specific primers, followed by cloning procedure. A total of 140 bacterial clones obtained were screened and clustered by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The pool of 16S rRNA sequences representing each RFLP cluster was subjected to phylogenetic analysis. All of the 33 sequences analysed were affiliated with the kingdom of Eubacteria; 28 sequences (77% of all clones) affiliated with the Proteobacteria, two sequences (19% of all clones) were affiliated with Actinobacteria and three sequences (4% of all clones) were affiliated with the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides division.

The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of directly amplified 16S rRNA genes, resulting in the phylogenetic analysis of the prokaryotic communities. Sequences of organisms potentially associated with processes such as anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction were thus identified. Overall, the sediment layers revealed the presence of sequences of quite diverse bacterial and archaeal communities, which varied considerably with depth. Dominant types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms involved in the following processes: (1) anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction, (2) sulfide oxidation, and (3) a range of (aerobic) heterotrophic processes. In the communities in the lowest sediment layer sampled (22-34 cm), sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea of the ANME-2 cluster (likely involved in anaerobic methane oxidation) were prevalent, whereas heterotrophic organisms abounded in the top sediment layer (0-6 cm).

The activities of lipase, galactosidase, amylase, esterase and cellulase from isolated strains were qualitatively detected by using five selective media. Base on morphological characteristics, test of salt tolerance, screening of enzymatic characters and sequencing of 16S rDNA gene, strains were selected for phylogenetic analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 43 halophilic actinomycetes and 3 extreme halophilic actinomycetes were obtained. Screening results for enzyme activity showed that 4 halophilic actinomycetes produced lipase, 30 strains produced galactosidase, 27 strains produced amylase, 6 strains produced esterase, 4 strains produced cellulose and 1 strain produced 4 enzymes simultaneously.

The variable detections of methane by the Curiosity rover, orbiters, and terrestrial telescopes, coupled with methane's short lifetime in the martian atmosphere, may imply an active gas source in the planet's subsurface, with migration and surface emission processes similar to those known on Earth as “gas seepage.” Here, we review the variety of subsurface processes that could result in methane seepage on Mars. Such methane could originate from abiotic chemical reactions, thermogenic alteration of abiotic or biotic organic matter, and ancient or extant microbial metabolism. These processes can occur over a wide range of temperatures, in both sedimentary and igneous rocks, and together they enhance the possibility that significant amounts of methane could have formed on early Mars.

Whereas three clades of ANME have been repeatedly studied with respect to phylogeny, key genes and genomic capabilities, little is known about their sulfate-reducing partner. In order to identify the partner of anaerobic methanotrophs of the ANME-2 clade, bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed from cultures highly enriched for ANME-2a and ANME-2c in consortia with Deltaproteobacteria of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group (DSS). Phylogenetic analysis of those and publicly available sequences from AOM sites supported the hypothesis by Knittel and colleagues that the DSS partner belongs to the diverse SEEP-SRB1 cluster. Six subclusters of SEEP-SRB1, SEEP-SRB1a to SEEP-SRB1f, were proposed and specific oligonucleotide probes were designed. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization on samples from six different AOM sites, SEEP-SRB1a was identified as sulfate-reducing partner in up to 95% of total ANME-2 consortia. SEEP-SRB1a cells exhibited a rod-shaped, vibrioid, or coccoid morphology and were found to be associated with subgroups ANME-2a and ANME-2c. Moreover, SEEP-SRB1a was also detected in 8% to 23% of ANME-3 consortia in Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano sediments, previously described to be predominantly associated with SRB of the Desulfobulbus group.

Two seepage domains are recognized: mud breccia extrusion from a summit, and hydrocarbon venting from peripheral sites, hosting chemosynthetic ecosystems and authigenic carbonates indicative of long-term seepage.

The BTF was operated at 20 (±2) °C, ambient pressure with continuous supply of methane for 248 days. Sulfate reduction with simultaneous sulfide production (accumulating ∼7 mM) after 200 days of BTF operation evidenced anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulfate reduction.

Our study confirms previous suggestions that at least some of the mud volcano fluids are a mixture of deeper salt-rich water and surficial/precipitation water. No apparent water quality differences were found between sampling sites north and south of a major geological fault line. Microbiological analyses revealed diverse communities, both aerobic and anaerobic, including sulfate reducers, methanogens, carbon dioxide fixing and denitrifying bacteria. Several identified species were halophilic and likely derived from the deeper salt-rich subsurface water, while we also cultivated pathogenic species from the Vibrionaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanellaceae, and Clostridiaceae. These microorganisms were likely introduced into the mud volcano fluids both from surface water or shallow ground-water, and perhaps to a more minor degree by rain water.

Distinct water masses are present throughout the oceans, which drive thermohaline circulation. These water masses may contain specific microbial assemblages. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of physical and geological phenomena on the microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column. Chemical measurements were combined with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial community in the water column at five sites. We demonstrate that the chemistry and microbial community of the water column were stratified into three distinct water masses. The salinity and nutrient concentrations vary between these water masses. Nutrient concentrations increased with depth, and salinity was highest in the intermediate water mass. Our PLFA analysis indicated different lipid classes were abundant in each water mass, suggesting that distinct groups of microbes inhabit these water masses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed the presence of distinct microbial communities in each water mass. Taxa involved in autotrophic nitrogen cycling were enriched in the intermediate water mass suggesting that microbes in this water mass may be important to the nitrogen cycle of the Eastern Mediterranean. The Eastern Mediterranean also contains numerous active hydrocarbon seeps. We sampled above the North Alex Mud Volcano, in order to test the effect of these geological features on the microbial community in the adjacent water column. The community in the waters overlaying the mud volcano was distinct from other communities collected at similar depths and was enriched in known hydrocarbon degrading taxa.

However, the processes involved in the assembly and dynamics of methanotrophic populations in complex natural microbial communities remain unclear. Here we investigated the development of a methanotrophic microbiome following subsurface mud eruptions at Hakon Mosby mud volcano (1250 m water depth). Freshly erupted muds hosted deep-subsurface communities that were dominated by Bathyarchaeota, Atribacteria and Chloroflexi. Methanotrophy was initially limited to a thin surface layer of Methylococcales populations consuming methane aerobically. With increasing distance to the eruptive center, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterales and thiotrophic Beggiatoaceae developed, and their respective metabolic capabilities dominated the biogeochemical functions of the community. Microbial richness, evenness, and cell numbers of the entire microbial community increased up to tenfold within a few years downstream of the mud flow from the eruptive center.

The communities fundamentally changed in their structure and functions as reflected in the metagenome turnover with distance from the eruptive center, and this was reflected in the biogeochemical zonation across the mud volcano caldera.

Preliminary studies of vent and seep systems in the Nordic Seas have identified the temperate-cold-water pelagic amphipod Themisto abyssorum as a potentially important predator in these chemosynthetic habitats. However, the prey of this deep-sea predator is poorly known, and we applied denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to investigate the predator–prey interactions of T. abyssorum in deep-water vent and seep systems.

We found a wide range of organisms including micro-eukaryotes, metazoans and detritus. Themisto abyssorum specimens from Loki's Castle had the highest diversity of prey.

In this study, we investigated the microbial communities in sediment and overlying seawater at two SMVs located on the Ryukyu Trench off Tanegashima Island, southern Japan. The microbial communities in mud-volcano sediments were generally distinct from those in the overlying seawaters and in the well-stratified Pacific margin sediments collected at the Peru Margin, the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank off Oregon, and offshore of Shimokita Peninsula, northeastern Japan. Nevertheless, in-depth analysis of different taxonomic groups at the sub-species level revealed that the taxon affiliated with Atribacteria, heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria that typically occur in organic-rich anoxic subseafloor sediments, were commonly found not only in SMV sediments but also in the overlying seawater. We designed a new oligonucleotide probe for detecting Atribacteria using the catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). CARD-FISH, digital PCR and sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes consistently showed that Atribacteria are abundant in the methane plumes of the two SMVs (0.58 and 1.5 × 104 cells/mL, respectively) but not in surrounding waters, suggesting that microbial cells in subseafloor sediments are dispersed as “deep-biosphere seeds” into the ocean.

Most of this biomass derives from animals that are associated with bacterial symbionts, which are able to metabolize the chemical resources provided by the seeping fluids. Often these systems also harbor dense accumulations of non-symbiotic megafauna, which can be relevant in exporting chemosynthetically fixed carbon from seeps to the surrounding deep sea. Here we investigated the carbon sources of lithodid crabs (Paralomis sp.) feeding on thiotrophic bacterial mats at an active mud volcano at the Costa Rica subduction zone. To evaluate the dietary carbon source of the crabs, we compared the microbial community in stomach contents with surface sediments covered by microbial mats. The stomach content analyses revealed a dominance of epsilonproteobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences related to the free-living and epibiotic sulfur oxidiser Sulfurovum sp. We also found Sulfurovum sp. as well as members of the genera Arcobacter and Sulfurimonas in mat-covered surface sediments where Epsilonproteobacteria were highly abundant constituting 10% of total cells. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of bacterial fatty acids such as i-C15:0 and C17:1ω6c with stable carbon isotope compositions as low as −53‰ in the stomach and muscle tissue. These results indicate that the white microbial mats at Mound 12 are comprised of Epsilonproteobacteria and that microbial mat-derived carbon provides an important contribution to the crab's nutrition.

The hydrocarbons represent potential substrates for microorganisms. We studied lipid biomarkers, stable isotope ratios, the effect of substrate (methane, other organic compounds) addition and 16S rRNA genes to gain insights into the hitherto unknown microbial community at this site. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that bacteria were much more abundant than archaea. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA clone sequences indicated the presence of bacterial and archaeal lineages generally associated with the methane cycle (methanogens, aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs), the sulfur cycle (sulfate reducers), and groups linked to the anaerobic degradation of alkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons. The presence of sulfate reducers, methanogens and methanotrophs in this habitat was also confirmed by concurrent surveys of lipid biomarkers and their isotopic signatures. Incubation experiments with several common and complex substrates revealed the potential of the indigenous microbial community for sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and aerobic methanotrophy.

Large areas of sedimentary deposits of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) and pockmarks of the Vestnesa Ridge (VR) are covered with bacterial mats 0.1 to 0.5 cm thick. The microbial community making up bacterial mats of the HMMV was predominated by large filamentous bacteria with filaments measuring up to 100 microns in length and 2 to 8 microns in width. The occurrence of rosettes allowed the observed filamentous bacteria to be referred to the morphologically similar genera Leucothrix or Thiothrix. Three morphological types of filamentous bacteria were identified in bacterial mats covering VR pockmarks. Filaments of type one are morphologically similar with representatives of the genera Thioploca or Desmanthos. Type two filaments had numerous inclusions of sulfur and resembled representatives of the genus Thiothrix. The third morphological type was constituted by single filaments made up of tightly connected disk-like cells and can, apparently, be assigned to the genus Beggiatoa. The rates of methane oxidation (up to 1570 microliters C/(dm3 day)) and sulfate reduction (up to 17 mg S/(dm3 day)) measured in surface sediments of HMMV and VR were close to the maximum rates of these processes observed in badly polluted regions of the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea. High rates of microbiological processes correlated with the high number of bacteria. The rate of methane production in sediments studied was notably lower and ranged from 0.1 to 3.5 microliters CH4/(dm3 day). Large areas of the HMMV caldera were populated by pogonophoras, represented by the two species, Sclerolinum sp. and Oligobrachia sp. The mass development of Sclerolinum sp. in the HMMV caldera was by the activity of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria localized inside the cells of these animals. Bacterial cells were also found in the trophosome tissue of Oligobrachia sp., but in cells of these bacteria, we did not observe the membrane structures typical of methanotrophs. The localization pattern of pogonophoras on the surface of reduced sediments suggests that the predominant bacteria in Oligobrachia tissues are sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11195584", "doi": "10.1023/A:1026666527034", "venue": "Microbiology", "journal": "Microbiology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1216062889", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["127497772", "129387583", "129408339", "88292597", "85739153", "32827351", "140166658", "7080613", "28585232"], "inbound_citations": ["53052355", "59431789", "40615942", "45573668", "54037602", "212652440", "12184932", "59390849", "10635838", "29370532", "20323445", "52916139", "3622420", "18093793", "23941270", "19737091", "33076590", "129009780", "44485180"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10758220"}

In this study, we propose an unsupervised, model-based binning method with two clustering tiers, which uses a novel transformation of the oligonucleotide frequency-derived error gradient and GC content to generate coarse groups at the first tier of clustering; and tetranucleotide frequency to refine these groups at the secondary clustering tier. The proposed method has a demonstrated improvement over PhyloPythia, S-GSOM, TACOA and TaxSOM on all three benchmarks that were used for evaluation in this study. The proposed method is then applied to a pyrosequenced metagenomic library of mud volcano sediment sampled in southwestern Taiwan, with the inferred population structure validated against complementary sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA marker genes.

We measured CO2 fluxes of the Bledug Kuwu mud volcano on the Kendeng Fold and thrust belt in the back arc of Central Java, Indonesia, using scanning remote sensing absorption spectroscopy. The data show that the expelled gas is rich in CO2 with a volume fraction of at least 16 vol %. A lower limit CO2 flux of 1.4 kg s-1 (117 t d-1) was determined, in line with the CO2 flux from the Javanese mud volcano LUSI. Extrapolating these results to mud volcanism from the whole of Java suggests an order of magnitude total CO2 flux of 3 kt d-1, comparable with the expected back-arc efflux of magmatic CO2. After discussing geochemical, geological, and geophysical evidence we conclude that the source of CO2 observed at Bledug Kuwu is likely a mixture of thermogenic, biogenic, and magmatic CO2, with faulting controlling potential pathways for magmatic fluids.

Methylotrophic methanogenesis was measured all along the sediment core, Methanosarcinales affiliated sequences were detected using archaeal 16S PCR-DGGE and mcrA gene libraries, and enrichments of methanogens showed the presence of Methanococcoides in the shallow sediment layers. Overall acetoclastic methanogenesis was higher than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, which is unusual for cold seep sediments. Interestingly, acetate porewater concentrations were extremely high in the AMV sediments. This might be the result of organic matter cracking in deeper hotter sediment layers.

We here present zinc (Zn) isotope compositions measured on serpentinites and other rocks from the Isua supracrustal sequence and on serpentinites from modern ophiolites, midocean ridges, and the Mariana forearc. In stark contrast to modern midocean ridge and ophiolite serpentinites, Zn in Isua and Mariana serpentinites is markedly depleted in heavy isotopes with respect to the igneous average.

The Håkon Mosby mud volcano (Barents Sea, 1,280 m) is a rather stable chemosynthetic driven habitat characterized by prominent surface bacterial mats with high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Here, the nematode Halomonhystera hermesi thrives in high abundances (11,000 individuals 10 cm(-2)). Halomonhystera hermesi is a member of the intertidal Halomonhystera disjuncta species complex that includes five cryptic species (GD1-5). GD1-5's common habitat is characterized by strong environmental fluctuations. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of H. hermesi and GD1, H. hermesi's closest relative. Genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are more strongly expressed in H. hermesi than in GD1, and many genes were only observed in H. hermesi while being completely absent in GD1. Both observations could in part be attributed to high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Additionally, fatty acid elongation was also prominent in H. hermesi confirming the importance of highly unsaturated fatty acids in this species. Significant higher amounts of transcription factors and genes involved in signaling receptor activity were observed in GD1 (many of which were completely absent in H. hermesi), allowing fast signaling and transcriptional reprogramming which can mediate survival in dynamic intertidal environments. GC content was approximately 8% higher in H. hermesi coding unigenes resulting in differential codon usage between both species and a higher proportion of amino acids with GC-rich codons in H. hermesi. In general our results showed that most pathways were active in both environments and that only three genes are under natural selection. This indicates that also plasticity should be taken in consideration in the evolutionary history of Halomonhystera species. Such plasticity, as well as possible preadaptation to low oxygen and high sulfide levels might have played an important role in the establishment of a cold-seep Halomonhystera population.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4758239", "pubmed_id": "26637468", "doi": "10.1093/gbe/evv242", "venue": "Genome Biology and Evolution", "journal": "Genome Biology and Evolution", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2235079277", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["31562123", "4357965", "3898580", "25713689", "44988460", "205033495", "55929824", "83595500", "84234838", "17821515", "9771978", "5965331", "83665774", "35517672", "16604496", "24726414", "2748948", "87525610", "26160257", "14129037", "1326628", "11937574", "86504164", "5057", "13130671", "206340350", "31817302", "35645904", "1900312", "12588236", "36575526", "84784389", "84687936", "392051", "26107169", "26523545", "7199914", "2472684", "18978465", "24479600", "20992184", "820863", "8596088", "40153241", "22990213", "9946392", "6229656", "20208318", "15588516", "18982727", "24766418", "17618336", "25900154", "29889829", "2207269", "21158843", "7260461", "20460411", "205907743", "10692374", "83562409", "2829093", "59390849", "29370532", "86774493", "89265843", "83250557", "24315482", "30589645", "53470260", "84784012", "21330280", "88911490", "15889163", "63085861", "2629989", "26878158", "20804430", "24775674"], "inbound_citations": ["205640279", "18949415", "3447818", "214885731", "8934754", "4059807"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16888850"}

Results from 16S rRNA microbiome data indicate the presence of a diverse assemblage of associated microorganisms in carnivorous sponges mainly from the Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriaceae and Thaumarchaeota. While the abundance of particular groups varied throughout the dataset, we found interesting similarities to previous microbiome results from non-carnivorous deep sea sponges, suggesting that the carnivorous sponges share characteristics of a previously hypothesized putative deep-sea sponge microbial community. Chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis was confirmed for C. methanophila through a microbial community with a high abundance of Methylococcales and very light isotopic δ13C and δ15N ratios (-60 to -66‰/3.5 to 5.2‰) compared to the other cladorhizid species (-22 to -24‰/8.5-10.5‰). We provide evidence for the presence of putative sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria in the arctic cladorhizids; however, δ13C and δ15N signatures did not provide evidence for significant chemoautotrophic symbiosis in this case, and the slightly higher abundance of cladorhizids at the JMVF site compared to the nearby deep sea likely stem from an increased abundance of prey rather than a more direct vent association. The phylogenetic position of C. methanophila in relation to other carnivorous sponges was established using a three-gene phylogenetic analysis, and it was found to be closely related to other non-methanotrophic Cladorhiza species with a similar morphology included in the dataset, suggesting a recent origin for methanotrophy in this species.

The objective of the study was to assess properties and impacts of pristine volcanic material depositions on soil properties and to provide management options for restoring the affected agroecosytem. Land satellite imagery was used for field studies to observe the distribution, thickness and properties of ashfall deposition. The pristine ashfall deposits and the underlying soils were sampled for mineralogical, soluble salt, chemical, physical and toxic compound analyses. Results showed that uneven distribution of rainfall at the time of violent eruption caused the areas receiving mud ashfall developed surface encrustation, which was not occur in areas receiving dry ashfall. Ashfall damaged the agroecosytem by burning vegetation, forming surface crusts, and creating soil acidity and toxicity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses of encrustated layer indicated the presence of gypsum and jarosite minerals. Gypsum likely acted as a cementing agent in the formation of the encrustation layer with extremely low pH (2.9) and extremely high concentrations of Al, Ca and S. Encrustation is responsible for limited water infiltration and root penetration, while the extremely high concentration of Al is responsible for crop toxicity. Mud ashfall and dry ashfall deposits also greatly changed the underlying soil properties by decreasing soil pH and cation exchange capacity and by increasing exchangeable Ca, Al, and S availability. Despite damaging vegetation in the short-term, the volcanic ashfall enriched the soil in the longer term by adding nutrients like Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, Si and S. Suggested management practices to help restore the agroecosystem after volcanic eruptions include: (i) the application of lime to increase soil pH, increase cation exchange capacity and decrease Al and S toxicities, (ii) the selection of crops which are tolerant to low pH and high concentrations of soluble Al and S, (iii) physically disrupting the hard surface crusts that form on some soils (if <2 cm thick) to allow water infiltration and root penetration, (iv) application of N and K fertilizers, and (v) incorporation of dry ashfall into the soil (if <5 cm thick) to exploit the newly deposited nutrients.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26599148", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.157", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "2177670792", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["49564770", "198987035"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25275226"}

Comparative sequence analysis of the host-specific 18S and the symbiont-specific 16S rRNA genes of S. contortum showed that the close phylogenetic relationship of this host to vestimentiferan siboglinids was mirrored in the close relationship of its symbionts to the sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacterial symbionts of vestimentiferans. A similar congruence between host and symbiont phylogeny was observed in O. haakonmosbiensis: both this host and its symbionts were most closely related to the frenulate siboglinid O. mashikoi and its gammaproteobacterial symbiont. The symbiont sequences from O. haakonmosbiensis and O. mashikoi formed a clade unaffiliated with known methane- or sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that the dominant bacterial phylotypes originated from endosymbionts residing inside the host trophosome. In both S. contortum and O. haakonmosbiensis, characteristic genes for autotrophy (cbbLM) and sulfur oxidation (aprA) were present, while genes diagnostic for methanotrophy were not detected.

Here, we examine serpentinite clasts expelled from mud volcanoes above the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction zone forearc (Pacific Ocean) that contain complex organic matter and nanosized Ni-Fe alloys. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy, we determined that the organic matter consists of a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic compounds and functional groups such as amides. Although an abiotic or subduction slab-derived fluid origin cannot be excluded, the similarities between the molecular signatures identified in the clasts and those of bacteria-derived biopolymers from other serpentinizing systems hint at the possibility of deep microbial life within the forearc. To test this hypothesis, we coupled the currently known temperature limit for life, 122 °C, with a heat conduction model that predicts a potential depth limit for life within the forearc at ∼10,000 m below the seafloor. This is deeper than the 122 °C isotherm in known oceanic serpentinizing regions and an order of magnitude deeper than the downhole temperature at the serpentinized Atlantis Massif oceanic core complex, Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We suggest that the organic-rich serpentinites may be indicators for microbial life deep within or below the mud volcano.

The high concentrations of As, Fe and Mn in the groundwater is consistent with low Eh values (under moderately reduced state). Moreover, the observed Na/Cl and SO 4 /Cl molar ratios in groundwater demonstrate the influence of seawater intrusion. Seawater intrusion could provide required electron acceptors (i.e., SO 4 ) for bacterial sulfate reduction and promote reducing conditions that are favorable for As mobilization. The concurrent increases in the concentrations of Fe and Mn from 2005 to 2006 may be caused by bacterial Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction. Geochemical modeling demonstrate that As(III) is the dominant As species and the presence of Fe-bearing carbonates, sulfides, and oxide phases may locally act as potential sinks for As. Mud volcano fluids were also collected and analyzed to assess the possible source of As in the Chia-Nan plain groundwater. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic signatures indicate that the As-rich mud volcano fluids may have been modified by chemical exchange with 18 O-rich crustal rocks and possibly originated from mixing of deep brines with circulating meteoric water. Thus As in the Chia-Nan plain groundwater may have been evolved from deep crustal fluids or rock sources.

Information on the dynamics of benthic viruses and their interactions with prokaryotes in mud volcano ecosystems is still completely lacking. We investigated the impact of viral infection on the mortality and assemblage structure of benthic prokaryotes of five mud volcanoes in the Mediterranean Sea. Mud volcano sediments promote high rates of viral production (1.65-7.89 × 10(9) viruses g(-1) d(-1)), viral-induced prokaryotic mortality (VIPM) (33% cells killed per day) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production (3.0-8.3 μgC g(-1) d(-1)) when compared with sediments outside the mud volcano area. The viral shunt (that is, the microbial biomass converted into dissolved organic matter as a result of viral infection, and thus diverted away from higher trophic levels) provides 49 mgC m(-2) d(-1), thus fuelling the metabolism of uninfected prokaryotes and contributing to the total C budget. Bacteria are the dominant components of prokaryotic assemblages in surface sediments of mud volcanoes, whereas archaea dominate the subsurface sediment layers. Multivariate multiple regression analyses show that prokaryotic assemblage composition is not only dependant on the geochemical features and processes of mud volcano ecosystems but also on synergistic interactions between bottom-up (that is, trophic resources) and top-down (that is, VIPM) controlling factors.

Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) directly emit the major gas phase, methane, into the atmosphere, making them important sources of greenhouse gases over geological time. Quantification of methane emission would require detailed insights into the capacity and efficiency of microbial metabolisms either consuming or producing methane in the subsurface, and establishment of the linkage between these methane-related metabolisms and other microbial or abiotic processes. Here we conducted geochemical, microbiological and genetic analyses of sediments, gases, and pore and surface fluids to characterize fluid processes, community assemblages, functions and activities in a methane-emitting MV of southwestern Taiwan. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that aerobic/anaerobic methane oxidation, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are active and compartmentalized into discrete, stratified niches, resembling those in marine settings. Surface evaporation and oxidation of sulfide minerals are required to account for the enhanced levels of sulfate that fuels subsurface sulfate reduction and anaerobic methanotrophy. Methane flux generated by in situ methanogenesis appears to alter the isotopic compositions and abundances of thermogenic methane migrating from deep sources, and to exceed the capacity of microbial consumption.

In this study, the microbial diversity and community structure in methane-rich sediments of the Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) were investigated by comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the active volcano center, which has a diameter of about 500 m, the main methane-consuming process was bacterial aerobic oxidation. In this zone, aerobic methanotrophs belonging to three bacterial clades closely affiliated with Methylobacter and Methylophaga species accounted for 56%+/-8% of total cells. In sediments below Beggiatoa mats encircling the center of the HMMV, methanotrophic archaea of the ANME-3 clade dominated the zone of anaerobic methane oxidation. ANME-3 archaea form cell aggregates mostly associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Desulfobulbus (DBB) branch. These ANME-3/DBB aggregates were highly abundant and accounted for up to 94%+/-2% of total microbial biomass at 2 to 3 cm below the surface. ANME-3/DBB aggregates could be further enriched by flow cytometry to identify their phylogenetic relationships. At the outer rim of the mud volcano, the seafloor was colonized by tubeworms (Siboglinidae, formerly known as Pogonophora). Here, both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidizers were found, however, in lower abundances. The level of microbial diversity at this site was higher than that at the central and Beggiatoa species-covered part of the HMMV. Analysis of methyl-coenzyme M-reductase alpha subunit (mcrA) genes showed a strong dominance of a novel lineage, mcrA group f, which could be assigned to ANME-3 archaea.

The role of microbial processes in methane cycling and organic transformation in such environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to uncover functional potentials and community assemblages across geochemical transitions in a ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV of eastern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles combined with 16S rRNA gene abundances indicated that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by ANME-2a group coincided with iron/manganese reduction by Desulfuromonadales at shallow depths deprived of sulfate. The activity of AOM was stimulated either by methane alone or by methane and a range of electron acceptors, such as sulfate, ferrihydrite, and artificial humic acid. Metagenomic analyses revealed that functional genes for AOM and metal reduction were more abundant at shallow intervals. In particular, genes encoding pili expression and electron transport through multi-heme cytochromes were prevalent, suggesting potential intercellular interactions for electron transport involved in AOM. For comparison, genes responsible for methanogenesis and degradation of chitin and plant-derived molecules were more abundant at depth. The gene distribution combined with the enhanced proportions of 16S rRNA genes related to methanogens and heterotrophs, and geochemical characteristics suggest that particulate organic matter was degraded into various organic entities that could further fuel in situ methanogenesis. Finally, genes responsible for aerobic methane oxidation were more abundant in the bubbling pool and near-surface sediments. These methane oxidizers account for the ultimate attenuation of methane discharge into the atmosphere. Overall, our results demonstrated that various community members were compartmentalized into stratified niches along geochemical gradients.

Yet, little is known about the bacterial hydrocarbon degraders active in situ. Here, we provide the link between previous biogeochemical measurements and the cultivation of degraders by direct identification of SRB responsible for butane and dodecane degradation in complex on-site microbiota. Two contrasting seep sediments from Mediterranean Amon mud volcano and Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) were incubated with (13)C-labeled butane or dodecane under sulfate-reducing conditions and analyzed via complementary stable isotope probing (SIP) techniques. Using DNA- and rRNA-SIP, we identified four specialized clades of alkane oxidizers within Desulfobacteraceae to be distinctively active in oxidation of short- and long-chain alkanes. All clades belong to the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) clade, substantiating the crucial role of these bacteria in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation at marine seeps. The identification of key enzymes of anaerobic alkane degradation, subsequent β-oxidation and the reverse Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for complete substrate oxidation by protein-SIP further corroborated the importance of the DSS clade and indicated that biochemical pathways, analog to those discovered in the laboratory, are of great relevance for natural settings. The high diversity within identified subclades together with their capability to initiate alkane degradation and growth within days to weeks after substrate amendment suggest an overlooked potential of marine benthic microbiota to react to natural changes in seepage, as well as to massive hydrocarbon input, for example, as encountered during anthropogenic oil spills.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4184016", "pubmed_id": "24722631", "doi": "10.1038/ismej.2014.51", "venue": "The ISME Journal", "journal": "The ISME Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2036752092", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["129588755", "32706960", "9170653", "6632242", "24981401", "40960884", "39005099", "10840385", "1482341", "21909078", "1223432", "128560843", "28081257", "27867995", "31671726", "5385476", "16590366", "12954856", "1022966", "1757090", "22805077", "12218715", "31230639", "22784350", "11255712", "22117061", "16608362", "12546763", "251141", "43520341", "7925244", "28838964", "12630750", "3712884", "3965918", "28948140", "205528070", "4393454", "46420501", "140639772", "2907163", "7741024", "16538896", "11767206", "25044869", "23173464", "83673615", "129672602", "6284087", "18978445", "205524087", "14313771", "55496111", "55466124", "14676493", "42423655", "5068915", "14035041", "85776534", "9696817", "96347378", "17711073", "102238744", "18088333", "27481984", "41852456", "4394530", "33475128", "8323332", "205788654", "45944606", "12986414", "23169780", "98485310", "774363", "621919", "26116334", "82628500", "86076096", "25065193", "205156602", "9919676", "2600486", "1059118", "50473"], "inbound_citations": ["53222996", "174816172", "195737922", "15016709", "215599922", "19264381", "28558909", "34439160", "212665607", "4389105", "102353210", "14473402", "11671306", "632643", "1468791", "14591343", "39607311", "99703098", "10735774", "21717277", "153310729", "6544927", "16535361", "214808284", "4122060", "14987942", "44061771", "7324953", "214878495", "215076968", "12583026", "39212809", "3411242", "214853483", "52261927", "214863219", "24256601", "16147291", "26021987", "43966270", "215296721", "52169314", "6584927", "19404903", "6381453", "14248086", "214938595", "215065175", "14988610", "215206726", "23741184", "59603728", "4447833", "3799418", "45695581", "49640431", "730997", "209169040", "215666289", "215584218"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1587067"}

Biogeochemical and molecular genetic analyses were carried out to assess the methanogenic activity rates, pathways and diversity in the hypersaline sediments of the centre of the Napoli mud volcano. Methylotrophic methanogenesis was the only significant methanogenic pathway in the shallow sediments (0-40 cm) but was also measured throughout the sediment core, confirming that methylotrophic methanogens could be well adapted to hypersaline environments. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway below 50 cm; however, low rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were also present, even in sediment layers with the highest salinity, showing that these methanogens can thrive in this extreme environment.

A natural cap on the capacity of the microbial methane filter was also discovered: the upward flow of sulphate- and oxygen-free volcanic fluids restricts the efficiency of methane oxidation, allowing much of the methane to escape to the hydrosphere and potentially the atmosphere.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17051217", "doi": "10.1038/nature05227", "venue": "Nature", "journal": "Nature", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2126064727", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["21707159", "55167497", "131081103", "140180510", "129030780", "53117185", "37367416", "55138340", "128540735", "128688788", "140682936", "129510619", "55452666", "7273753", "140639772", "22539509", "205009562", "56471050", "21723395", "129152545", "54004003"], "inbound_citations": ["4380470", "215357251", "55903758", "14885970", "21008512", "130626876", "55482801", "3861696", "10722019", "4646323", "55484124", "59431789", "54014230", "86863283", "7916015", "5971642", "4700658", "45573668", "1757090", "54037602", "3765136", "29101901", "172137150", "23392126", "54528934", "56222661", "22498325", "15087859", "90207633", "19094156", "56064399", "134649706", "59390849", "210696600", "210927243", "21106222", "129914950", "28558909", "12412775", "16563586", "15021185", "215318983", "52242827", "86867348", "126171732", "4796635", "182184214", "34181281", "4779013", "56159924", "210874385", "195804288", "84727320", "125988560", "9024353", "57013465", "59146483", "14834233", "1154322", "195185567", "8819857", "15333101", "17079946", "54937562", "55466124", "23397743", "2216104", "17319801", "3699876", "11210120", "31121451", "49430911", "46697722", "135299118", "82998685", "13905690", "7925244", "6847856", "26786508", "22970703", "215442769", "11607332", "196610782", "214935498", "23775715", "29041241", "24166765", "54920917", "215323764", "59945275", "52916139", "199545289", "196665735", "129546984", "38469321", "4797412", "214827724", "7097552", "640679", "55358198", "49214293", "20285115", "202695721", "38728909", "3280073", "5642396", "134617687", "3761643", "214988461", "18148052", "32865942", "19519224", "46417230", "92984051", "30373433", "54579247", "52261927", "129045640", "4391386", "15516045", "24256601", "55300456", "56279253", "14583627", "164578506", "1261846", "895140", "215265781", "56293369", "73477982", "55607939", "198415071", "86352010", "14828550", "34819847", "13438555", "215158760", "54521820", "6002656", "18088333", "3308927", "13659442", "205156705", "17433720", "3469821", "54874860", "46674418", "14199395", "6865355", "23941270", "52814049", "53473161", "215049601", "6153701", "56026350", "93781753", "20023799", "5916927", "202029207", "4714471", "6313788", "131432327", "9282507", "4529729", "94753012", "55687146", "3331769", "208279838", "26011615", "197421270", "209149142", "28333410", "215627990", "12817596", "2244475", "10182502", "52112134", "214902409", "73446701", "215561603", "1059118", "67863935", "8323332", "21490211", "39816673", "135084248", "6318248"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4430700"}

AOM has also been reported in the deep biosphere. But the responses of the primary microbial players in eliciting changes in geochemical environments, specifically in methane and sulfate supplies, have yet to be fully elucidated. Marine mud volcanoes (MVs) expel a complex fluid mixture of which methane is the primary component, forming an environment in which AOM is a common phenomenon. In this context, we attempted to identify how the prokaryotic community would respond to changes in methane and sulfate intensities, which often occur in MV environments in the form of eruptions, diffusions or seepage. We applied an integrated approach, including (i) biochemical surveys of pore water originated from MV, (ii) in vitro incubation of mud breccia, and (iii) prokaryotic community structure analysis. Two distinct AOM regions were clearly detected. One is related to the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) at depth of 30-55 cm below the sea floor (bsf); the second is at 165-205 cm bsf with ten times higher rates of AOM and SR. This finding contrasts with the sulfide concentrations in pore waters and supports the suggestion that potential AOM activity below the SMTZ might be an important methane sink that is largely ignored or underestimated in oceanic methane budget calculations. Moreover, the incubation conditions below the SMTZ favor the growth of methanotrophic archaeal group ANME-2 compared to ANME-1, and promote the rapid growth and high diversity of bacterial communities. These incubation conditions also promote the increase of richness in bacterial communities. Our results provide direct evidence of the mechanisms by which deep AOM processes can affect carbon cycling in the deep biosphere and global methane biochemistry.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4231134", "pubmed_id": "25393146", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0113004", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1978884797", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["129891129", "4320117", "8502195", "4390333", "7058662", "2501355", "33722848", "16896470", "14596453", "41852456", "4383740", "31107045", "640679", "46420501", "125265467", "55872585", "129923939", "140180510", "129474435", "3555941", "19160730", "10667400", "128632867", "140669455", "129956413", "128904868", "11140501", "84391584", "25599058", "22778674", "518676", "205009562", "4430700", "83673615"], "inbound_citations": ["1431461", "215556610"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14583627"}

The aim of this study was to find biomarkers to allow the evaluation of the effects of volcanic mud and anthropogenic pollution on fish health in the Brantas Delta. The study took places at the Brantas Delta, which was polluted by volcano mud, and at reference sites in Karangkates and Pasuruan. Leukocyte numbers were determined using a Neubauer hemocytometer and a light microscope. Differential leukocyte counts were determined using blood smears stained with May Grunwald-Giemsa, providing neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts. Macrophages were taken from fish kidney, and their phagocytic activity was measured. In vitro analyses revealed that leukocyte and differential leukocyte counts (DLC) were higher in Channa striata and Chanos chanos caught from the polluted area. Macrophage numbers were higher in Oreochromis mossambicus than in the other species, indicating that this species is more sensitive to pollution. In areas close to volcanic mud eruption, all specimens had lower phagocytic activity.

Microbial activity at the thermodynamic edge, such as the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulphate reduction (SR), is thus unlikely to thrive in these environments. In this study, carbon and sulphur cycling was investigated in the extremely hypersaline cold seep sediments of Mercator mud volcano. AOM activity was partially inhibited but still present at salinity levels of 292 g L(-1) (c. eightfold sea water concentration) with rates of 2.3 nmol cm(-3) day(-1) and was even detectable under saturated conditions. Methane and evaporite-derived sulphate comigrated in the ascending geofluids, which, in combination with a partial activity inhibition, resulted in AOM activity being spread over unusually wide depth intervals. Up to 79% of total cells in the AOM zone were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as anaerobic methanotrophs of the ANME-1.

The profiles of methane concentration and carbon isotopic composition revealed various orders of the predominance of specific methane-related metabolisms along depth. At a site proximal to the bubbling pool, the methanogenic zone was sandwiched by the anaerobic methanotrophic zones. For two sites distributed toward the topographic depression, the methanogenic zone overlaid the anaerobic methanotrophic zone. The predominance of anaerobic methanotrophy at specific depth intervals is supported by the enhanced copy numbers of the ANME-2a 16S rRNA gene and coincides with high dissolved Fe/Mn concentrations and copy numbers of the Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter 16S rRNA gene. Assemblages of 16S rRNA and mcrA genes revealed that methanogenesis was mediated by Methanococcoides and Methanosarcina. pmoA genes and a few 16S rRNA genes related to aerobic methanotrophs were detected in limited numbers of subsurface samples. While dissolved Fe/Mn signifies the presence of anaerobic metabolisms near the surface, the correlations between geochemical characteristics and gene abundances, and the absence of aerobic methanotrophs in top sediments suggest that anaerobic methanotrophy is potentially dependent on iron/manganese reduction and dominates over aerobic methanotrophy for the removal of methane produced in situ or from a deep source. Near-surface methanogenesis contributes to the methane emissions from mud platform. The alternating arrangements of methanogenic and methanotrophic zones at different sites suggest that the interactions between mud deposition, evaporation, oxidation and fluid transport modulate the assemblages of microbial communities and methane cycling in different compartments of terrestrial mud volcanoes.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3971192", "pubmed_id": "24723919", "doi": "10.3389/fmicb.2014.00121", "venue": "Front.

Our results show that temperature had the most profound influence on all life-cycle parameters compared to a smaller effect of salinity. Life-history traits of closely related cryptic species were differentially affected by temperature, salinity and presence of sulphides which shows that cryptic H. disjuncta species are not ecologically equivalent. Our results further revealed that GD1 had the highest tolerance to a combination of sulphides, high salinities and low temperatures. The close phylogenetic position of GD1 to Halomonhystera hermesi, the dominant species in sulphidic sediments of the Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barent Sea, 1280 m depth), indicates that both species share a recent common ancestor.

Here, we show that five recently isolated Methanococcoides strains from a range of sediments (Aarhus Bay, Denmark; Severn Estuary mudflats at Portishead, United Kingdom; Darwin Mud Volcano, Gulf of Cadiz; Napoli mud volcano, eastern Mediterranean) can directly utilize choline for methanogenesis producing ethanolamine, which is not further metabolized. Di- and monomethylethanolamine are metabolic intermediates that temporarily accumulate. Consistent with this, dimethylethanolamine was shown to be another new growth substrate, but monomethylethanolamine was not. The specific methanogen inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) inhibited methane production from choline. When choline and trimethylamine are provided together, diauxic growth occurs, with trimethylamine being utilized first, and then after a lag (∼7 days) choline is metabolized. Three type strains of Methanococcoides (M. methylutens, M. burtonii, and M. alaskense), in contrast, did not utilize choline. However, two of them (M. methylutens and M. burtonii) did metabolize dimethylethanolamine.

Based on these characteristics, \"Candidatus Marithrix\" was used as a model organism for the assessment of genomic plasticity along segments of a single filament using next generation sequencing to possibly identify hotspots of microevolution. Using six consecutive segments of a single filament sampled from a mud volcano in the Gulf of Mexico, we recovered ca. 90% of the \"Candidatus Marithrix\" genome in each segment. There was a high level of genome conservation along the filament with average nucleotide identities between 99.98-100%. Different approaches to assemble all reads into a complete consensus genome could not fill the gaps. Each of the six segment datasets encoded merely a few hundred unique nucleotides and 5 or less unique genes - the residual content was redundant in all datasets. Besides the overall high genomic identity, we identified a similar number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the clonal segments, which are comparable to numbers reported for other clonal organisms. An increase of SNPs with greater distance of filament segments was not observed. The polyploidy of the cells was apparent when analyzing the heterogeneity of reads within a segment. Here, a strong increase in single nucleotide variants, or 'intrasegmental sequence heterogeneity' (ISH) events, was observed.

The predominant group detected (methane seep group 2), representing 74% of clonal abundance, was phylogenetically related to the nifH sequences obtained from the Methanosarcina species but was most closely related to the nifH sequences potentially derived from the anoxic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2 archaea). The recovery of the nif gene clusters including the nifH sequences of the methane seep group 2 and the subsequent reverse transcription-PCR detection of the nifD and nifH genes strongly suggested that the genetic components of the gene clusters would be operative for the in situ assimilation of molecular nitrogen (N2) by the host microorganisms. DNA-based quantitative PCR of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene, the group-specific mcrA (a gene encoding the methyl-coenzyme M reductase α subunit) gene, and the nifD and nifH genes demonstrated the similar distribution patterns of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene, the mcrA groups c-d and e, and the nifD and nifH genes through the core sediments.

Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from the total community DNA from these fractions showed that similar archaeal populations were present in both fractions. However, the bacterial populations in the fractions differed from one another, and were more diverse than the archaeal ones.

The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified lipids, one unidentified phospholipid and one unidentified aminolipid. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain AMV1T was related most closely to the type strains of ::: Tepidamorphus gemmatus ::: , ::: Bauldia consociata ::: , ::: Afifella pfennigii ::: and ::: Amorphus coralli ::: , four members of the order ::: Rhizobiales ::: (class ::: Alphaproteobacteria ::: ), with pairwise sequence similarities of 95.0, 94.5, 94.4 and 94.0 %, respectively; it shared <94 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with all the other members of the order ::: Rhizobiales ::: . Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain AMV1T clustered with ::: Tepidamorphus gemmatus ::: and with species of the genera ::: Amorphus ::: , ::: Rhodobium ::: and ::: Afifella ::: . Phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics thus suggest that strain AMV1T is a representative of a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Lutibaculum baratangense gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Lutibaculum baratangense is AMV1T ( = KCTC 22669T = NBRC 105799T = CCUG 58046T).", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22021575", "doi": "10.1099/ijs.0.036350-0", "venue": "International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology", "journal": "International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2105995441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["24247817", "14441902", "7311923", "10479314", "12148511", "22170957", "24059264", "45295609", "206183927", "82444653", "83882406", "84410351", "4430700", "8819857", "206184977", "23068243", "12287470", "45218576", "93941964", "33974871", "24860900", "2168180", "6695416", "37870408", "36746841", "38490651", "195834345"], "inbound_citations": ["38819813", "211248378", "34666873", "35851385"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38728909"}
