8819857,"Biogeochemistry and Community Composition of Iron- and Sulfur-Precipitating Microbial Mats at the Chefren Mud Volcano (Nile Deep Sea Fan, Eastern Mediterranean)","In this study we determined the composition and biogeochemistry of novel, brightly colored, white and orange microbial mats at the surface of a brine seep at the outer rim of the Chefren mud volcano. These mats were interspersed with one another, but their underlying sediment biogeochemistries differed considerably. Microscopy revealed that the white mats were granules composed of elemental S filaments, similar to those produced by the sulfide-oxidizing epsilonproteobacterium ""Candidatus Arcobacter sulfidicus."" Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that microorganisms targeted by a ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus""-specific oligonucleotide probe constituted up to 24% of the total the cells within these mats. Several 16S rRNA gene sequences from organisms closely related to ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" were identified. In contrast, the orange mat consisted mostly of bright orange flakes composed of empty Fe(III) (hydr)oxide-coated microbial sheaths, similar to those produced by the neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing betaproteobacterium Leptothrix ochracea. None of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from these samples were closely related to sequences of known neutrophilic aerobic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. The sediments below both types of mats showed relatively high sulfate reduction rates (300 nmol x cm(-3) x day(-1)) partially fueled by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (10 to 20 nmol x cm(-3) x day(-1)). Free sulfide produced below the white mat was depleted by sulfide oxidation within the mat itself. Below the orange mat free Fe(II) reached the surface layer and was depleted in part by microbial Fe(II) oxidation. Both mats and the sediments underneath them hosted very diverse microbial communities and contained mineral precipitates, most likely due to differences in fluid flow patterns.","with Mn(II) and Mn(IV) (9) and is used as an electron donor in a variety of aerobic and anaerobic sulfide-oxidizing microorganisms. Well-known marine sulfide-oxidizing organisms include the giant vacuolated Gammaproteobacteria, such as Beggiatoa and Thiomargarita spp., which use oxygen or nitrate for respiration and often form dense mats above hydrocarbon seeps (7, 29, 59, 61) . Other types of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria that are mostly known from hydrothermal vent systems but are also found sporadically in cold seep systems belong to the Epsilonproteobacteria (10) . Little is known about the nature and functioning of other types of bacteria and archaea which appear to be commonly associated with cold seep ecosystems, such as the crenarchaeotal groups marine benthic group B (MBGB) and MBG1 (35, 36, 52) . Here we report on our investigation of the biogeochemistry and microbial community structure of two types of closely associated bacterial mats. These mats were discovered during a dive with the submersible Nautile (IFREMER) to a brineimpacted cold seep at the bottom of the Chefren mud volcano located in a large caldera of the western Nile Deep Sea Fan (Menes Caldera). Similar types of mats have been seen at hydrothermal vents (16, 74, 77) but to date have not been described in association with cold seeps. In this study we combined microscopic, biogeochemical, and molecular analyses to identify the underlying factors that cause the formation of these two distinct mat systems. This work was part of the ESF EUROCORES EUROMARGIN project MEDIFLUX, which is an integrated study of fluid and gas seepage through the seabed of the Nile Deep Sea Fan. Methane oxidation rate determination. Methane oxidation rates were measured using 14 CH 4 gas, based on previously described methods (24, 81) . Subcores were injected with 10 l of 14 CH 4 (2.5 kBq [total radioactivity] dissolved in double-distilled H 2 O) and incubated for 24 h in the dark at the in situ temperature, 14°C. Following incubation the cores were sectioned and fixed with 2.5% NaOH. Further processing was done as described by Treude et al. (81) . AOM rates were determined using the following equation: AOM rate ϭ [ 14 CO 2 /( 14 CO 2 ϩ 14 CH 4 )] ⅐ [CH 4 ]/V/t, where 14 CO 2 is the activity of CO 2 produced, 14 CH 4 is the activity of the residual injected 14 CH 4 , [CH 4 ] is the CH 4 concentration, V is the sediment volume, and t is time. SR rate determination. Sulfate reduction (SR) rates were obtained using 35 SO 4 Ϫ2 and previously described methods (27) . Subcores were injected with 5 l 35 SO 4 Ϫ2 (100 kBq [total radioactivity] dissolved in double-distilled H 2 O) and incubated for 24 h at the in situ temperature in the dark. Following incubation, the sediment was sectioned and placed in a polypropylene tube containing 20% zinc acetate. Further processing was done as described by Kallmeyer et al. (30) . SR rates were calculated using the following equation: SR rate ϭ [TRI 35 S/ (TRI 35 ]/V/t, where TRI 35 S is the activity of total reduced inorganic sulfur, 35 SO 4 2Ϫ is the activity of the residual 35 ] is the SO 4 Ϫ2 concentration in the sample, V is the sediment volume, and t is time. Geochemical measurements. For sulfide analysis, 10 l of 0.1 N NaOH was added to 2-ml pore water subsamples. Subsamples were analyzed on board using a TRAACS800 continuous-flow analyzer and colorimetric methods described by Grasshoff et al. (20) . Pore water major element analyses were conducted using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy; 2-ml subsamples were acidified by adding 100 l of suprapur HNO 3 (1 M), bubbled to remove sulfide, and stored in the dark at 4°C. Sulfate concentrations were measured by analyzing S. The standard deviation for all measurements was Ͻ3%. The geochemical composition of the solid phase was also determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy after total dissolution of sediments in an acid mixture containing HClO 4, HNO 3 , and HF (64) . The organic carbon content was determined using the method described by van Santvoort et al. (85) . International and in-house standards and duplicates were processed to monitor precision and accuracy. Note that very little pore water was recovered from the 7-to 9-cm sample from the orange mat; therefore, a high error is likely associated with values for this sample. Light and epifluorescence microscopy. Sediment sections were preserved in 2% formalin and artificial seawater for acridine orange (AO) staining, as well as for light microscopy. Samples for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were initially fixed in a 2% formalin-seawater solution, washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, and finally stored in a phosphate-buffered salineethanol solution (1:1). Specific groups of Bacteria and Archaea were quantified using catalyzed reporter deposition FISH (CARD-FISH); the exceptions were ANME-2 and aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (M␥705 probe) (15) , for which monolabeled FISH probes were used because no results were obtained with CARD-FISH probes. AO staining (6) , FISH (73) , and CARD-FISH (23) were all performed using previously described methods. All FISH and CARD-FISH slides were counterstained with 4Ј,6Ј-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). At least 30 grids were counted randomly for each slide for AO, FISH, and CARD-FISH counts. Probe hybridization details are given in Table 1 . Cell numbers for conspicuous ANME-SRB aggregates were estimated using a semidirect method (7) . All aggregates and cells were assumed to be spherical. The average cell volume was estimated to be 0.065 m 3 . The volume of an average aggregate (82 m 3 ) was divided by the cell volume, and a ratio of archaeal cells to bacterial cells of 1:1 was used to calculate bacterial and archaeal cell numbers in the consortium. SEM-EDX. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, formalin-fixed samples were analyzed with a LEO 1550VP scanning electron microscope equipped with an in-lens detector, and element analysis was performed with an INCA Energy 300 system equipped with an Si(Li) detector. 16S rRNA gene construction and phylogenetic analysis. Sectioned sediment samples were frozen at Ϫ20°C until processing. Archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries were created as described by Niemann et al. (58) . Briefly, total community DNA was extracted from sediment sections and orange flakes using a FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Biogene, Irvine, CA). Total DNA was extracted from formalin-preserved white granules using Chelex-100 resin. Granules were boiled at 100°C in the presence of Chelex-100 resin, the beads were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was used for PCR. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from archaea using primers ARCH20F (49) and Uni1392R (38) and from bacteria using primers GM3F (53) and GM4R (31) . Amplification products were cloned, and the purified plasmid was sequenced using an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer. Plasmids were sequenced initially in one direction (approxi-VOL. 74, 2008 IRON-AND SULFUR-PRECIPITATING MATS AT MUD VOLCANO 3199 on January 17, 2020 by guest http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from mately 0.6 kb). Sequences were manually inspected, and poor-quality sequences were removed from further analysis. Sequences were also screened for chimeras using the Mallard program (4) . Anomalous sequences were then further investigated using BLAST and the Pintail program (3) . Sequences with genuine chimeras were then excluded from further analyses. Selected clones were then sequenced fully (approximately 1.5 kb) and used for subsequent phylogenetic analysis with the ARB (44) software package. Statistical analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries was performed using the s-libshuff program by Schloss et al. (70) . Distance matrices calculated with ARB using the neighbor-joining tool were used for s-libshuff. Fluid flow models. Mass transfer models including fluid flow and molecular diffusion were created using the Comsol-Multiphysics modeling suite and were with permission of Geosciences Azur/CIESM.)

""X"" indicates the location close to Chefren characterized by orange and white mats, and the circle indicates the location where brine samples were obtained during Nautile dive 18. The maps in panels B and C were obtained during METEOR expedition BIONIL M70/2 in 2006 using the EM120 multibeam. calibrated against the measured Cl Ϫ concentration. As Cl Ϫ can be considered nonreactive, the mass balance is governed by diffusion and advection according to the following equation: 0 ϭ ⅐ D s ⅐ d 2 C/dz 2 Ϫ vdC/dz, where C is the pore water Cl Ϫ concentration, z is the vertical distance, is the porosity, D s is the diffusion coefficient for Cl Ϫ in the pore space, and v is the vertical velocity. Diffusion coefficients were corrected for tortuosity using the interpolated porosity at each depth and the procedure of Iversen and Jørgensen (25) . The concentrations at the surface were set to the Cl Ϫ concentration measured in the bottom water of the push cores, and the concentration at the lower boundary of the modeled regimen (1 m) was set to the concentration measured below 15 cm (below the white mat) or 17 cm (below the orange mat) in both cores. This left the pore water flow as the only unknown, which could be estimated by numerically finding the best fit to the measured Cl Ϫ profiles. Each steady-state calcu-lation was followed by 10 h of stagnation to include the time that the sediment was contained in the core liner before sectioning. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers EF687138 to EF687656 and EF688595. Visual observations. White mats and orange mats were located at a small brine seep on a steep slope at the bottom of a small mound adjoining the northwestern rim of the Chefren mud volcano (Fig. 1C ) at a water depth of 3,020 m. The mats on January 17, 2020 by guest http://aem.asm.org/ had a patchy distribution and covered about 25 m 2 ( Fig. 2A and B). Shimmering brine fluid flowed downward from black sediments above the white mats ( Fig. 2B ). Associated with the orange patches at this site, and also at other areas of Chefren, were many crabs feeding on the sediments, which were populated by small worm tubes sticking out 1 to 2 cm above the sediment. The surfaces of the cores recovered from the white mat were composed of thick white cotton ball-like precipitates that resembled filamentous sulfur aggregates ( Fig. 2C ), which have previously been observed at hydrothermal vents (78) . Polychaete larvae ( Fig. 2C ) were observed crawling through the white mats, as well as through the surface of the core. The surfaces of the cores from the orange mat were composed of a thick layer of fluffy yellow material, as well as flaky, bright orange particles, resembling Fe(III) (hydr)oxides ( Fig. 2D ). Similar to the cores from the white mat, polychaete larvae were also associated with the orange mat. We followed the orange and white mat structure to the southwest along the same depth contour for about 50 m. Irregular patches of orange mat occurred within a band that was about 2 m wide and also in association with the edge of the brine lake in the center of the Chefren mud volcano ( Fig. 2E ). When using the manipulator arm of Nautile to dig into the orange patches, we observed that the subsurface sediments were dark gray to blackish, while the surrounding seafloor was light brown-beige, typical of pelagic sediments in the deep Eastern Mediterranean. No trace of gas ebullition was observed upon disturbance of the seafloor. Wide areas of the brine lakes located at the top of the Chefren and Cheops mud volcanoes were covered with white mats (Fig. 2F ) similar to those observed on the sediments. Microscopy. Examination of the granules recovered from the surface of the white mat ( Fig. 3A) revealed the presence of tufts of thin filaments ( Fig. 3B ) morphologically similar to those produced by the epsilonproteobacterium ""Candidatus Arcobacter sulfidicus"" (77, 78) . SEM coupled to EDX analysis revealed that these tufts were characterized by large amounts of Fe and S (Fig. 3C ). Framboidal pyrite grains (not shown) were also detected within these granules. FISH with probe Arc94 (Fig. 3D ), which targets ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" and related species, indicated that this group of organisms constituted up to 24% of the total cells within the white granules and in the underlying black sediment (Table 2 ). However, several morphologies (e.g., filamentous and coccoid) of cells which hybridized with the probe were observed, some of which were not the typical crescent-shaped ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" cells. Microscopic examination of flakes recovered from the surface of the orange mat ( Fig. 2D and 3E) revealed numerous microbial sheaths of assorted sizes ( Fig. 3F and G), similar to those produced by or attributed to the neutrophilic Fe(II)oxidizing bacterium Leptothrix ochracea (16, 17, 86) . EDX analysis revealed that many of these sheaths were associated with large amounts of Fe and O, indicating encrustation by Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. Most sheaths were sheared and empty ( Fig. 3G ). DAPI and AO staining both showed that very few sheaths (Ͻ1%) were populated with cells. FISH with the EUB I-III probe revealed that these sheaths contained bacteria, some of which could be targeted by the M␥705 probe ( Fig. 3H ) for type I methanotrophs but not by domain-specific probes for Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria. Two morphotypes of sheathed bacteria were targeted by the M␥705 probe, one with rectangular cells similar to Clonothrix fusca cells (87) and the other with square cells similar to Crenothrix polyspora cells (75) . These two morphotypes often appeared to be bundled together. Fluid flow model. The orange mats had a shallow Cl Ϫ gradient indicative of relatively low fluid flow. Hence, the 10-h stagnation of the flow in the core liners before processing had little effect on the shape of the profile, and the upward fluid flow velocity could be calculated with good accuracy and was 0.6 m per annum (a Ϫ1 ) (Fig. 4B ). The white mats were associated with a much steeper Cl Ϫ gradient, indicating higher fluid flow velocities. The relaxation of the gradient during the 10-h recovery caused the maximum velocity to be uncertain, but the minimum upward fluid flow under the white mat was estimated to be 15 m a Ϫ1 (Fig. 4A ). Biogeochemistry. Close to the white mat, the Cl Ϫ and Na ϩ concentrations were up to 1.8 times higher than those in the bottom water (water overlying the sediment in the core), indi- on January 17, 2020 by guest http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from cating that there was upward brine flow through the sediments ( Table 3 ). The pore water sulfate concentrations under the white mat ( Fig. 5A ) were close to seawater values at the surface and decreased to about 19 mM immediately below the surface, possibly reflecting sulfate concentrations in the upwardly seeping fluids. The SR rates (Fig. 5A) were highest in the top 4 cm (300 nmol ⅐ cm Ϫ3 ⅐ day Ϫ1 ) and 70-fold higher than the AOM rates (Fig. 5B ). The methane concentrations 5C ) was depleted to a concentration of Ͻ0.01 mM at levels above 5 cm, but the concentration increased to about 0.2 mM below this zone. These gradients match visual characteristics of the core, namely, the precipitation of Fe(II) with sulfide in the black, highly reduced sediment horizon up to 6 cm below the white mat (Fig. 5D ). In this layer, the Fe and S contents (Table  3 ) of the solid phase were several times higher than those in underlying sediments, indicating a high content of FeS and pyrite. Below the orange mat, the sulfate concentration decreased from 28 mM at the surface to about 5 mM at a sediment depth of 8 cm (Fig. 5E ). The Cl Ϫ and Na ϩ concentrations indicated that the sediments were also brine impacted, although to a lesser extent than the sediment underneath the white mat ( Table 3 ). The maximum SR rates (300 nmol ⅐ cm Ϫ3 ⅐ day Ϫ1 ) ( Fig. 5E ) occurred at depths between 6 and 10 cm. This coincided with blackish, reduced sediment similar to that observed directly beneath the white mat. A second maximum SR rate (150 nmol ⅐ cm Ϫ3 ⅐ day Ϫ1 ) was detected at 0 to 2 cm, just below the orange mat. The methane concentrations (Fig. 5F ) under the orange mat ranged from less than 0.01 mM at the surface to about 0.1 mM at the bottom of the core (Fig. 5F ). The AOM rates were highest in the first few centimeters (13 nmol ⅐ cm Ϫ3 ⅐ day Ϫ1 ). The SR rates in these sediments also exceeded the AOM rates by 11-fold. The sulfide concentrations under the orange mat were less than 0.01 mM. In contrast, the Fe(II) concentrations decreased from 0.7 mM just below the sediment surface to zero below a sediment depth of 16 cm (Fig. 5G ). Fe(II) was completely consumed in the surface layer below the orange mat. The solid-phase Fe and S contents ( Table 3) were high throughout the core, but the Fe level was elevated in the orange mat and in the 5-to 7-cm zone. In view of the Fe content and the much lower S content, it is likely that both horizons contained substantial amounts of Fe oxides. The organic carbon contents (Table 3 ) in both cores were low (0.18 to 0.77%), which is typical for oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean deep-sea sediments, indicating that the energy source for microbial reactions was not detritus based. CARD-FISH and FISH counts. The total cell numbers (Table 2) for both cores were around 10 9 cells ⅐ cm Ϫ3 in the upper 10 cm. In the white mat and its underlying sediment, the total cell numbers decreased to 10 8 cells ⅐ cm Ϫ3 below 10 cm, whereas below the orange mat the total cell numbers were more or less stable for the first 18 cm of sediment. Archaeal cells accounted for less than 3% of the total cells in both mats but generally accounted for 12 to 38% of the total cells in the underlying sediments. In accordance with the biogeochemistry of the cores, ANME were detected in the top 6 cm of both cores ( Table 2 and Fig. 6A and C) . ANME-2 cells formed consortia with SRB belonging to the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus cluster (Fig. 6A ). Free-living ANME-2 cells were not detected in the sediments. In contrast, the ANME-3 cells were all single cells and comprised 6 to 27% of the total cells in The number of total cells is the number of cells obtained by AO direct counting. All cell numbers are per ml of sediment. The counts for the ANME-1 and 660 probes were both less than 1% of the total number of cells in all samples. ""Ͻ"" indicates that the number of cells was less than 0.1% of the total number of cells. ND, not determined. OMOREGIE ET AL. APPL. ENVIRON. MICROBIOL. on January 17, 2020 by guest http://aem.asm.org/ the 6-to 10-cm zone under the white mat and 7% of the total cells in the 8-to 12-cm zone under the orange mat ( Table 2 and Fig. 6B ). The mats, as well as the top 2 cm of sediment from both cores, were dominated by bacteria (52 to 67% of the total cells in the sediments [ Table 2 ]). DSS658-targeted SRB made up less than 1% of the white mat community ( Table 2 and Fig.  6C ). The level increased to 5 to 25% of the total cells in the top 6 cm of sediment underneath the mat, where the maximum SR rate was detected, and dropped again to Ͻ1% in deeper sediment. DSS658-targeted SRB were more abundant in the orange mat and underlying sediment, where they comprised 8 to 19% of the total cells. Arc94-targeted cells made up 5 to 24% of the white mat and the top 4 cm of the underlying sediment ( Table 2 and Fig. 3D ). These cells comprised 4% of the total cells within the orange mat and Ͻ1% of the total cells in the underlying sediment. Type I methanotrophs targeted by M␥705 ( Table 2 and Fig.  3H ) comprised Ͻ1% of the cells in the white mat and in the sediment but 2 to 8% of the cells in the orange mat and the 2-cm interval beneath it. 16 rRNA gene analyses. 16S rRNA gene libraries for bacteria were constructed for both mats and the top 4 cm of sediment beneath the mats, whereas archaeal libraries were constructed only for the sediments. The phylotypes identified in the bacterial libraries for the mats, as well as for the underlying sediment, were very diverse and corresponded to microorganisms capable of many types of C, Fe, N, O, and S transforma- Table 4 and Fig. 7 ). Most of these sequences were closely related to sequences of the Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae SRB clades. Sequences belonging to relatives of the Desulfuromonadaceae were recovered from the sediments underneath the orange mat, as well as from the white mat (Table  4 and Fig. 7 ). Members of this family are capable of Fe(III) and S reduction (42, 66) . The Gammaproteobacteria sequences were the largest group of bacterial sequences (74 to 34%) from the orange mat and a major group of sequences in the sediment underneath this mat ( Table 4 and Fig. 8 ). Most of these sequences belonged to type I methanotrophs (42 to 7%), and the most closely related cultivated isolates (Ͻ91% identity) were Methylobacter marinus, C. polyspora, C. fusca, and other isolates. Sequences most closely related (Ͼ95% identity) to ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" and Sulfurimonas autotrophica made up 32% of the sequences recovered from the white mat. Sequences closely related to sequences from Sulfurospirillum arcachonense (Ͼ95% identity) were also recovered from both mats. Sequences from ANME-2a, ANME-2c, and ANME-3 accounted for 55 to 74% of the archaeal sequences from the sediment below the white and orange mats ( Table 4 and Fig.  9 ). ANME-3 sequences were detected only under the white mat and not under the orange mat, although ANME-3 cells were detected by FISH in both sediments. The ubiquitous seep-and subsurface sediment-associated groups of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, MBGB and MBGD, respectively, accounted for significant portions (19 to 38%) of the sequences recovered from the sediment of both cores. Primary productivity and organic matter fluxes to the seafloor have varied greatly in the history of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, but today this body of water is one of the most oligotrophic seas. Its bottom waters are fully oxygenated, and the organic matter flux to the seafloor is very low (8, 37, 60) . Surface-exposed reduced sediments and accumulations of organisms, such as sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, tubeworms, and bivalves ( Fig. 2 and 3 Generally, at cold seeps, sites with high sulfide fluxes across the seafloor are marked by mat-forming bacteria, which oxidize sulfide to sulfur or sulfate, using oxygen or nitrate as the electron acceptor. The cells are often mobile and hence can bridge the gap between sulfide and oxygen penetration in the sediments. The giant vacuolated sulfide oxidizers store elemental sulfur internally, which gives the mats a characteristic white color (29, 56, 61) . Mats formed by giant vacuolated sulfide oxidizers typically appear to be smooth (59) , furry (attached vacuolated filamentous cells) (61), or crusty (e.g., Thiomargarita spp. cold seep mats [29] ). The mats described here have a different appearance both macroscopically (cotton ball structure) and microscopically (external sulfur storage). To our knowledge, orange mats have not been described previously for marine cold seeps, but similar mats are have been found in a few hydrothermal vent settings (16, 34, 74) and at groundwater Fe(II) seeps (17) . At these sites, the mats are thought to be created by Fe(II)-oxidizing Beta-or Gammaproteobacteria belonging to the genera Gallionella, Leptothrix, and Marinobacter, as well as the gammaproteobacterial strain PV-1. Both the orange and white mats investigated here appear to represent important communities at brine-impacted cold seeps of the Eastern Mediterranean and were commonly observed floating on the brine (white mats [Fig. 2F ]) or at the edge of brine lakes (orange mats [ Fig. 2E]) . Composition of the white mats and orange mats. The granules recovered from the white mat were composed of elemental S filaments, as shown by light microscopy, SEM, and EDX analysis (Fig. 3) . These filaments were most likely produced by chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing organisms related to ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus,"" as indicated by 16S rRNA gene analysis and FISH, which showed that up to 24% of the cells within the mat were cells of close relatives of this organism. ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" secretes long S filaments as a by-product of sulfide oxidation (72) , forming dense accumulations of elemental S in hydrothermal vent settings (72) and in laboratory bioreactors (77) . ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" has also been detected in cold seep settings (65) . These environments are typically sulfidic, high-fluid-flow environments where sulfide and oxygen gradients overlap due to advective processes. Sequences closely related to sequences of Desulfocapsa sulfoexigens, which is capable of S disproportionation into sulfide, sulfate, and H ϩ (19) , represented another significant portion of the sequences from the white mat. The activities of these organisms within this mat would likely enhance S cycling as they would consume S, as well as provide additional sulfide. The flakes that made up the orange mat were composed of Fe(III) (hydr)oxide-encrusted sheaths (Fig. 3F and G) on January 17, 2020 by guest http://aem.asm.org/ to those produced by the neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing betaproteobacterium L. ochracea (86) . Such sheaths have been shown to be encrusted with Fe(III) (hydr)oxides (33, 74) and were identified in several hydrothermal vent settings (16, 34, 74) . The metabolism of L. ochracea is unclear as this species has not been obtained in pure culture. However, L. ochracea is generally considered a heterotroph and is often found in organic matter-rich environments. It is unlikely that the low organic carbon content of the Chefren sediments provides energy to heterotrophic mat-forming iron oxidizers (Table 3 ). Hence, we speculate that the organisms responsible for mat formation are unknown chemoautotrophs, which obtain energy from aerobic Fe(II) oxidation utilizing the high flux of upwardly flowing, Fe(II)-rich pore water. Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria are thought to form Fe oxide-encrusted sheaths in order to locate the electron transfer process close to the cell, as well as provide a means for the cell to escape encrustation by Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. The energetic yield of this process is very low; therefore, large amounts of Fe(II) need to be turned over in order to provide enough energy for growth, leading to large amounts of Fe(III) (hydr)oxide but very few cells (16) . Neutrophilic Fe(II) oxidation, although it occurs in a variety of environments, such as hydrothermal vents (16) , freshwater springs (26) , and plant root nodules (18) , remains somewhat enigmatic, as under these conditions Fe(II) spontaneously oxidizes to Fe(III). However, neutrophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria have been shown to increase Fe oxidation rates to values that are up to fourfold greater than abiotic rates (26, 57) . The exact mechanism of this process is currently unknown, but it has been suggested that it occurs through the binding and sequestration of Fe(II) by bacterial exopolymers (57) . It is possible that the M␥705-targeted sheaths and related 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from the orange mat corresponded to organisms similar to C. polyspora and C. fusca (87) . They often occur bundled together, as observed in this study. Whether these organisms can oxidize Fe(II) in addition to methane remains unclear, as they have only recently been cultivated. However, they are often found in environments where Fe(II) and methane cooccur, such as groundwater springs. Additionally, there have been several reports of C. polyspora sheaths incrusted in Fe(III) (hydr)oxides (79, 88) . No 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from the orange mat were similar to sequences of known Fe(II)-oxidizing species (e.g., sheath-forming Leptothrix spp., stalk-forming Gallionella spp., PV-1, and other organisms). In contrast, the orange mat contained many 16S rRNA gene sequences from bacteria that may constitute the reductive portion of the Fe cycle. Interestingly, sequences that grouped with Sulfurospirillum deleyianum, which is capable of Fe(III) reduction via S cycling, were detected within this mat (76) . The presence of an active group of such microorganisms could couple and enhance S and Fe cycling by oxidizing S compounds with Fe(III). Additionally, enrichments (Straub et al., unpublished) using sediment from underneath the white mat with ferrihydrite as the sole electron acceptor resulted in high numbers of ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" sequences in the 16S rRNA gene libraries, suggesting that these organisms have a role in Fe(III) reduction. Biogeochemical processes supporting white and orange microbial mat formation. Spatial heterogeneity in fluid flow on scales of meters to kilometers has been observed in several cold seep systems (45, 67) . Here we observed large variations in fluid flow ( Fig. 4 ) through microbial mats on scales of centimeters to meters associated with brine seepage. Brine seepage is a common feature of mud volcanoes in the Eastern Mediterranean Ridge (90, 91) and western province of the Nile Deep Sea Fan (Huguen et al., submitted). The brines often comigrate with hydrocarbons and sulfides (12, 84) . Fluids from the brine pool at Chefren had high methane (2.4 mM) and sulfide (7.2 mM) concentrations, a salinity of 150‰, and sulfate concentrations of around 50 mM (J.-C. Caprais, personal communication). Unfortunately, we could not sample the brine flowing from black exposed sediments to the white mats ( Fig.  2B ), but it is likely that sulfide was present in the brine, which precipitated Fe(II). The brine flow across the white mat likely impeded the exchange with oxygenated water from the water column, providing a microaerophilic environment for sulfide oxidation. Although the Cl Ϫ and Na ϩ profiles indicated that there was upward fluid flow, the possibility of multidirectional (i.e., lateral and downward) advection cannot be ruled out. Sulfide underneath the white mat was clearly provided by SR rather than by upward transport with brine ( Fig. 5 ). Furthermore, the distribution of DSS658-targeted cells matched the sulfide profile, as these cells accounted for a maximum of 24% of the total cells between 0 and 6 cm ( Table 2) . Although our sampling resolution did not allow precise determination of the limits of sulfide penetration, the rapid sulfide consumption at on January 17, 2020 by guest http://aem.asm.org/ Downloaded from the fluidic top of the core was likely due to the activity of ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" and other sulfide oxidizers. This environment is similar to high-fluid-flow environments (72, 77) , where sulfide and oxygen overlap due to advective processes, and is likely to be a niche for ""Ca. Arcobacter sulfidicus"" rather than for the giant vacuolated sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Similar to the biogeochemistry of the white mat, the SR rates under the orange mat were significantly higher than the AOM rates ( Fig. 5 ). SRB cells accounted for 7 to 19% of the total cells under the orange mat. The maximum SR activity occurred at roughly 4 to 10 cm, which corresponded to the zone where there were increased amounts of solid-phase Fe and S (Fig. 5 ). Sulfide produced in this subsurface zone likely caused the precipitation of Fe and S complexes, similar to the situation in the sediment horizon directly under the white mat. No free sulfide was detected within this core; therefore, it is likely that the entire sulfide production went into the reduction of Fe(III) and precipitation of Fe(II). The source of the very high free Fe(II) concentration under the orange mat remains unknown; in situ microbial Fe(III) reduction and upward flow of Fe-rich subsurface fluids are plausible possibilities. Bacterial community composition. As predicted from the markedly different biogeochemistries, significant differences (P value of Ͻ 0.01) were detected in comparisons of bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries obtained in this study between the two mats, as well as between the mats and their underlying sediments. The importance of SR was reflected by the high percentage of sequences (Table 4 ) belonging to members of the Deltaproteobacteria in both sediment libraries (31 to 42% [ Table 4 ]). As expected, these sequences grouped with sequences from genera of known sulfate reducers (Fig. 7 ) present at cold seeps, such as Desulfobacter, Desulfosarcina, Desulfocapsa, and Desulfobulbus (35) Some members of these genera are also capable of iron reduction (43) , which occurred within the orange mat and in the underlying sediment. Sequences from members of the Gammaproteobacteria which are able to perform Fe(II) oxidation, sulfide oxidation, or methane oxidation were very prevalent in the libraries (8 to 74%). Most of these organisms grouped with aerobic type I methanotrophs, such as M. marinus, C. polyspora, and C. fusca (Fig. 8) , as well as with environmental sequences from methane-rich sediments and symbionts in the gills of methanotrophic clams. Cultivated members of this group primarily oxidize methane with oxygen, but they are also capable of oxidizing other C-1 compounds. As methane occurred at the top of both cores and was present in the water column, the sediment surface and especially the more oxidized orange mats represent potential niches for aerobic methanotrophy. The high numbers of sequences of sulfur-oxidizing Epsilonproteobacteria (Fig. 8 ) in the white mat are consistent with the visual and biogeochemical data. Archaeal community composition. Fifty-five to 74% of the archaeal sequences (Table 4 ) recovered from sediments underlying the orange and white mats belonged to the ANME-2 and ANME-3 clusters (Fig. 9 ). The quantitative distributions of these sequences differed between the sediments underlying the mats, and they overlapped only in one horizon (4 to 6 cm) under the white mat (Tab 3). In contrast, most other cold seeps typically contain a mixture of ANME communities and there is a clear dominance of one community (36) . The Chefren seep represents the second known cold seep habitat characterized by a relatively high abundance of ANME-3 cells (59). However, none of the ANME-3 cells that were detected were associated with bacterial partners. The remaining archaeal sequences comprised members of two marine benthic groups (MBGB and MBGD) which are typical members of cold seep and subsurface communities (22, 36) . However, no members of these two groups have been cultivated; therefore, their roles in the sediments of Chefren and elsewhere remain unknown. A comparison of the coverage of archaeal sequences from sediments underneath the white mat to the coverage of archaeal sequences from sediments underneath the orange mat revealed a statistical difference (P value of Ͻ 0.01), indicating a different community structure. The reciprocal test showed that the sediment community under the orange mat was not significantly different from that under the white mat (P value of Ͼ 0.05); rather, it may have represented a subset of the white mat community. It is possible that the archaeal communities were more similar to each other than to the bacterial community in the sediments because they were largely comprised of methanotrophs, which could be less affected by the differences in sulfide and iron biogeochemistry. Comparison to other cold seep ecosystems. While the fluid flow velocities and SR rates were similar to those in previously investigated cold seep systems, the associated AOM rates were comparatively low (58, 59, 81, 83 ; Omoregie et al., submitted). The ratio of the SR rate to the methane oxidation rate (Ͼ28:1) differed substantially from the known stoichiometry of AOM 7 .

Hence, the sulfate-reducing community apparently utilized compounds other than methane or organic detritus (Table 3) . High rates of SR that are severalfold greater than AOM rates are generally associated with seepage of higher hydrocarbons and petroleum (28, 39, 58, 63 ; Omoregie et al., submitted). Besides methane, higher hydrocarbon compounds have been detected within the pore waters of Chefren and in the overlying water column and may fuel SR and Fe(III) FIG. 9 .

Mastalerz, unpublished data). Also, ANME-2 cells ( Table 2 ) accounted for only 8 to 25% of the total cells in this zone, and ANME-3 cells accounted for only 6 to 27% of the total cells. These values, as well as the total cell numbers (Ͻ10 9 cells cm Ϫ3 ), are lower than the values for other sites where AOM is the dominant biogeochemical process. Sites such as Hydrate Ridge, the Black Sea, and the Haakon Mosby mud volcano typically have ANME cell levels of Ͼ10 9 cells cm Ϫ3 , and these cells were found to comprise Ͼ90% of the total cells (7, 35) . Conclusion. This study elucidated some of the dominant microorganisms and processes involved in the formation of Fe(II)-oxidizing and sulfide-oxidizing mats at an active cold seep. Previously, these types of mats have been described only for hydrothermal vent settings, where sulfide and reduced iron were produced by seawater-rock interactions and advected by venting. Our findings suggest that such mats could also be fueled by microbial SR based on anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation maintained by relatively high fluid flow. Several questions still remain, such as the actual substrates fueling SR, the rates of microbial oxidation versus chemical Fe(II) and sulfide oxidation, the spatial relationship between the organisms that carry out these processes, and the ultimate fate of the end products [i.e., elemental S and Fe(III) (hydr)oxide)].",E.

6384919,A System for Incubations at High Gas Partial Pressure,"High-pressure is a key feature of deep subsurface environments. High partial pressure of dissolved gasses plays an important role in microbial metabolism, because thermodynamic feasibility of many reactions depends on the concentration of reactants. For gases, this is controlled by their partial pressure, which can exceed one MPa at in-situ conditions. Therefore, high hydrostatic pressure alone is not sufficient to recreate true deep subsurface in-situ conditions, but the partial pressure of dissolved gasses has to be controlled as well. We developed an incubation system that allows for incubations at hydrostatic pressure up to 60 MPa, temperatures up to 120° C and at high gas partial pressure. The composition and partial pressure of gasses can be manipulated during the experiment. The system is mainly made from off-the-shelf components with only very few custom-made parts. A flexible and inert PVDF incubator sleeve, which is almost impermeable for gases, holds the sample and separates it from the pressure fluid. The flexibility of the incubator sleeve allows for sub-sampling of the medium without loss of pressure. Experiments can be run in both static and flow through mode. The incubation system described here is usable for versatile purposes, not only the incubation of microorganisms and determination of growth rates, but also for chemical degradation or extraction experiments under high gas saturation, e.g. fluid-gas-rock-interactions in relation to carbon dioxide sequestration. As an application of the system we extracted organic acids from sub-bituminous coal using H2O as well as a H2O-CO2 mixture at elevated temperature (90°C) and pressure (5 MPa). Subsamples were taken during the incubation and analysed by ion chromatography. Furthermore we demonstrated the applicability of the system for studies of microbial activity, using samples from the Isis mud volcano. We could detect an increase in sulphate reduction rate upon the addition of methane to the sample.","The incubation of deep subsurface microorganisms under highpressure conditions is necessary because under non-in situ conditions (especially low pressure) metabolic processes and survival of microorganisms adapted to high hydrostatic pressure are negatively impacted (Yayanos and Dietz, 1983; Fang et al., 2010) . Since the first isolation of a pressure-adapted bacterium by Yayanos et al. (1979) numerous studies on the effect of elevated pressure on genetic, metabolic, and physiological aspects of microorganisms were carried out. Multiple biological effects of pressure on organisms were observed: shifts in metabolic activity (Abe et al., 1999; Bothun et al., 2004) , transcription profiles (e.g., Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2007) , and the dissociation of ribosomes (e.g., Schulz et al., 1976) , changes in growth rates (Yayanos, 1986; Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 2006; Takai et al., 2009) , gene regulation (Bartlett et al., 1989) , stabilization of proteins (Hei and Clark, 1994; Sun and Clark, 2001) , and the composition of membrane lipids (Delong and Yayanos, 1985; Kaneshiro and Clark, 1995) . For reviews of pressure effects on biological processes see Jaenicke (1983) and Bartlett (2002) . Biochemical processes are also influenced by physical implications of high hydrostatic pressure, because the thermal expansion coefficient (Frank, 1970) as well as viscosity and fluidity of water (Horne and Courant, 1965) affect chemical reactions and cellular processes. The idea of constructing and using a high-pressure vessel for studying deep-sea life is quite old. Zobell and Oppenheimer (1950) described a simple pressure vessel for the application of high hydrostatic pressure on microorganisms. Pressure was applied to a culture tube with a neoprene stopper working as piston for transmitting pressure to the sample. This type of pressure application is still being used today (Orcutt et al., 2008) . Yayanos (1969) and later Taylor and Jannasch (1976) presented techniques for subsampling of media and bacteria and the determination of reaction rates without decompression, thereby eliminating the repetitive and time-consuming decompression. The use of glass syringes or a flexible Teflon container instead of a sealed culture tube (Schmid et al., 1978) had the benefit of an inert reaction chamber. However, the leakage of gases from the media into the pressure liquid or vice versa required a gas-tight incubation chamber. Bernhardt et al. (1987) used flexible nickel tubes for incubations of methanogenic microorganisms with hydrogen. Also flexible cells made of gold (Seyfried, 1979) or titanium (Seyfried and Janecky, 1985) were used as high-pressure reaction chamber. However, such devices were designed for studies of hydrothermal alteration of basalt and therefore made for much higher temperatures than what is necessary for biological incubations. All described techniques are still in use. Recently Parkes et al. (2009) presented a high-pressure system that can accept drill cores, taken with a high-pressure corer without decompression. The system also allows for sub-sampling without decompression. Temperature also has an effect on growth rates and other physiological characteristics of all microorganisms. Thermophilic and thermotolerant microorganisms can be found at hydrothermal vents, terrestrial hot springs, and intraterrestrial habitats (Pedersen, 2000) like salt mines (Vreeland et al., 1998) , groundwater deep within Earth (Lin et al., 2006; Chivian et al., 2008) , or oil reservoirs (e.g., L 'Haridon et al., 1995) . Several techniques for the incubation of these thermophilic microorganisms are used: thermistors (e.g., Bernhardt et al., 1987) , drying ovens (Miller et al., 1988; Takai et al., 2008) , and water baths (e.g., Jannasch et al., 1996) . Incubators and water baths became the most commonly used techniques for keeping pressure vessels at the desired temperature. The application of elevated gas concentration in high-pressure incubations started about 25 years ago. Gases were applied to high-pressure vessels to maintain anaerobic conditions in incubations of hyperthermophilic archaea (e.g., Raven et al., 1992) , to obtain higher cell densities during incubation (e.g., Mukhopadhyay et al., 1999) or as substrate for methanogenic microorganisms (Bernhardt et al., 1987; Takai et al., 2008) . Nauhaus et al. (2002) incubated sediment samples from a methane hydrate field at different partial pressures of methane and showed a strong correlation between microbial activity and methane partial pressure. None of these incubation systems allowed manipulation of the gas partial pressure during the incubation or sub-sampling without decompression. Here, we present an inexpensive high-pressure hightemperature incubation system that allows the incubation of a sample at high hydrostatic pressure as well as the manipulation of the composition and concentration of the dissolved gasses in the medium during incubation. It is designed for both static and flow-through experiments and allows for sub-sampling the liquid phase including the dissolved gases without decompression. The key objective was to build a moderately priced incubation system that can easily be constructed and operated. To keep costs low we used standardized off-the-shelf items and only a few custom-made parts. With this system not only microbiological experiments under high hydrostatic and gas partial pressure can be performed. Geochemical experiments, for example the extraction of organic and inorganic compounds from rock samples under specific pressure and temperature conditions or mineral alteration studies are also possible. Initial tests of the system included applications for geochemical and microbiological experiments. The effect of high concentrations of CO 2 dissolved in water on the release of low molecular weight organic acids from sub-bituminous coal from the Waikato Basin (NZ) was studied, as well as the effect of high methane partial pressure on microbial activity in samples from the Isis mud volcano (IMV), off the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. The high-pressure incubation system (Figure 1 ) is composed of a reservoir vessel and a reaction vessel for the application of FIGURE 1 | Schematic drawing of the high-pressure incubation system. The medium is pressurized and enriched with gas in the reservoir vessel prior to flowing through the incubator sleeve that hangs inside the reaction vessel. Pressure in the reaction vessel is set and kept constant by a HPLC pump and a backpressure valve. hydrostatic pressure on an incubator sleeve, which hangs inside the pressure vessel and holds the sample. A sub-sampling system allows the retrieval of liquid subsamples during the experiment without decompression. Temperature is maintained by a heating/cooling bath (Julabo Labortechnik GmbH, Seelbach, Germany) that pumps the liquid through heating jackets around the reservoir and the reaction vessel. Medium is circulated in a closed loop and HPLC pumps maintain hydrostatic pressure. A photograph of the entire unit is shown in Figure 2 . For microbiological experiments all parts of the high-pressure incubation system can be sterilized by autoclaving. The task of the temperature-controlled reservoir vessel is to saturate the medium with gas to the desired level and to hold a reservoir of medium that is pumped through the system. The reservoir vessel is stainless steel cylinder (Dunze GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), with a volume of 255 cm 3 (inner dimensions: 3.4 cm diameter, 28.15 cm high; Figure 3A ). Top and bottom are closed with plugs with bores for 1/16 HPLC lines to allow for transfer of gas and medium in and out of the vessel. The reaction vessel ( Figure 3B ) is a stainless steel cylinder (Dunze GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The cylinder has an inner diameter of 3.5 and 27.0 cm in length (volume of 259.7 cm 3 ). Top and bottom are closed with plugs, each with bores for four 1/16 HPLC lines each. The vessel is sealed with banjo screws that push the plugs into their seals. The incubator ( Figure 3C ) is a sleeve of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Novoplast, Halberstadt, Germany), a polymer that is inert to almost all chemicals. Although this material is not as flexible as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), it was chosen due to its very low permeability for gases ( Table 1) . The sleeve is closed with two gold-coated stainless steel plugs (3 μm gold thickness; Schempp and Decker, Berlin, Germany) with two gutters, each holding a perfluoro-elastomer O-ring (FFKM, Parker Hannifin, Pleidelsheim, Germany). FFKM was used for its chemical resistance. Both stoppers have a central threaded bore for the connection with a 1/16 HPLC line: one for inflow of medium at the bottom of the incubator and one for outflow at the top of the incubator. The incubator was designed to avoid corrosion, therefore only inert materials (PVDF, FFKM, and gold) were used. The sleeve has a diameter of 25 mm and can have a maximum length of 22 cm, which leads to a maximum volume of 68 cm 3 . Inside the incubator the medium first has to pass through a 1.5 cm thick layer of 2 mm diameter glass beads, followed by a 1.5 cm thick layer of quartz wool (organic free by annealing in a muffle furnace) so that the stream of medium passes evenly through the sample material over the entire cross section of the incubator sleeve. On top of the sample, the described layers follow in opposite order; first quartz wool for holding back most of the fine particles that could clog the lines and valves, followed by glass beads until the incubator is full and the sample well packed. Additional to the chemical resistance and the almost complete impermeability for gases, further advantages of using a PVDF sleeve is its relatively low price, allowing for the possibility of using it as a disposable article. Thereby, cross contamination between samples can be excluded. Furthermore, mechanical stress leading to a weakening of the material and, therefore, a possible leakage of medium or inflow of pressure fluid will be prevented. The incubator sleeve hangs inside the reaction vessel and is connected to the top plug of the incubation vessel via the 1/16 HPLC lines.  A sub-sampling device allows taking fluid samples during the experiment without decompression ( Figure 3D) . It is attached to the high-pressure line between the reservoir vessel and the reaction vessel. The sub-sampler is made from 1/4 stainless steel tubing (7.9 cm in length, inner diameter 0.225 cm, total volume 0.513 cm 3 ) and has a three-way-valve (Swagelok Limited, Tromode, UK) at the top and a shut-off valve (Supelco) at the bottom. The three-way-valve connects the sub-sampler to the incubation system. The third connection of the valve is used to either apply vacuum to the sub-sampler prior to sampling to avoid oxidation of the sample or to apply overpressure (nitrogen gas) to push out the remainder of the sample. After the sub-sampler is evacuated, the three-way-valve is turned and the sample enters the sub-sampler. Then the three-way-valve is closed and the shut-off valve at the bottom of the system is opened and the sample transferred into a sampling vial. Nitrogen Gas is added through the three-way-valve to push out the remaining sample. Pressure is generated by a modified HPLC pressure pump (SYKAM S 1122, Sykam GmbH, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany, modifications according to Kallmeyer et al., 2003) . A second identical pump is used to circulate the medium through the reservoir vessel and the incubator sleeve. Pressure is kept constant through a backpressure valve (pressure regulator series KHB, Swagelok Limited, Tromode, UK). All pressure vessels (reservoir and reaction vessel) are connected to 100 MPa pressure gages (WIKA Alexander Wiegand SE and Co. KG, Klingenberg, Germany). All pumps and vessels are connected with 1/16 HPLC lines (CS Chromatographie, Langerwehe, Germany). If not mentioned otherwise all valves were obtained from Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA. To avoid the possible entry of gas bubbles into the pump, an empty HPLC column (25.1 cm in length, inner diameter 0.45 cm, total volume 4 cm 3 ; Sykam GmbH, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany) is used as a gas trap, mounted vertically between the reaction vessel and the pump to collect any gas bubbles that may form. The medium flows from top to bottom, so the gas bubbles are trapped at the top.  We used the system for the extraction of low molecular weight organic acids, which are a potential microbial energy source, from a coal sample using water and water-carbon dioxide mixture at 90˚C and 5 MPa. In a second application we incubated sediment from a mud volcano that is known to exhibit high rates of anaerobic methane oxidation at 23˚C and 10 MPa total pressure and 4 MPa methane partial pressure (96 mmol/l) and measured an increase in sulfide concentration. We selected a sub-bituminous coal sample [vitrinite reflectance ( Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) such as formate, acetate, and oxalate are known to be the main organic compounds obtained from aqueous extractions of lignites and coals (Vieth et al., 2008) . The LMWOAs are also components of the macromolecular organic material of the coal (Glombitza et al., 2009) and are released from the coal matrix during ongoing maturation into the surrounding pore water. Isis mud volcano lies on the Egyptian continental margin in the Nile deep-sea fan (NDSF) in a water depth of ∼991 m and covers an area of approximately 10 km 2 . The NDSF is a sedimentary wedge that is deposited since the late Miocene by the Nile river (Loncke et al., 2004) with an assumed thickness of up to 10 km. Deeper sediments become strongly overpressured by the thick sedimentary overburden, resulting in an upward migration of fluids and gases (Loncke et al., 2004) . Among other mud volcanoes in the area, IMV is emitting large volumes of gas (Dupré et al., 2008) , including methane, ethane, and propane ). These gases are probably a mixture from different sources, because their isotopic composition is rather inconclusive with regards to a thermogenic or microbial origin (Mastalerz et al., 2007) . The emitted gases -mostly methane -are substrates for microorganisms. In sediment samples of the IMV Omoregie et al. (2009) found several genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfosarcina, Desulfococcus, Desulfocapsa, Desulfobulbus) as well as Methanococcoides, a methanogenic Archea, and the anaerobic methane oxidizers ANME-1, ANME-2, and ANME-3. The sample was taken during the NAUTINIL expedition in 2003 at 32˚22 N; 31˚23 E in 1020 m water depth and stored in a glass bottle at 4˚C with a nitrogen headspace. About a week prior to the experiments, the headspace was flushed with methane. Immediately prior to the incubation experiments, concentration of hydrogen sulfide and methane in the pore water was around 6 and 4.8 mmol/l, respectively. We extracted the coal sample at elevated temperature (90˚C) and pressure (5 MPa) using deionized water in the first experiment and a water-carbon dioxide mixture in the second. Five grams (approx. 9.4 cm 3 ) of the freeze-dried and powdered coal sample were placed in the incubator sleeve. For the water extraction, the experiment was started after reservoir and reaction vessel had reached 5 MPa and 90˚C. In the second experiment with the H 2 O-CO 2 mixture, gas was added to the reservoir vessel after heating to 90˚C and left overnight for equilibration. The experiment and the circulation of the gas-saturated medium started after equilibration. Pressure was generated by adding CO 2 until 5 MPa were reached and pressure had stabilized as maximum gas saturation had been reached (approximately 106 g/l or 2.4 mol/l of dissolved CO 2 ). Extractions were carried out for a total of 48 h. Subsamples (0.513 cm 3 ) of the medium were taken after 6, 22, 30, and 48 h and flushed into 513 μl of a 3.6/3.4 mmol/l solution of Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 containing 2% isopropanol to reduce the volatility of the LMWOAs thereby avoiding a loss of these compounds. The subsamples were immediately frozen until analysis (within 1 week). Sample analysis was performed by ion chromatography (IC) without further dilution. The incubation of sediment samples from IMV was performed at a pressure of 10 MPa and a temperature of 23˚C, using an artificial seawater medium (Widdel and Bak, 1992 ) with a sulfate concentration of 27 mmol/l. In the first experiment the medium contains just 0.1 mmol/l of methane (from the dilution of the sediment sample pore water methane), whereas in the second experiment the medium contained 96 mmol/l methane. In order to be able to detect even small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, the volume of the reservoir vessel was reduced to 145 ml by adding glass beads (5 mm diameter). Inside an anaerobic glove box 10 cm 3 of IMV sediment were loaded into the incubator sleeve. The experiment with only artificial anoxic seawater medium was started after reservoir and reaction vessel were equilibrated to 10 MPa and 23˚C. In the second experiment the medium was first pressurized with methane to 4 MPa, leading to a methane concentration of approximately 1.6 g/l or 96 mmol/l of dissolved methane and left overnight for equilibration. After methane saturation was complete, pressure was increased hydrostatically to 10 MPa with anoxic artificial seawater medium. The sample was loaded into the incubation vessel and pressurized prior to the experiment; circulation of the gas-saturated medium started after equilibration. Incubations were carried out for a total of 432 h (9 days). Subsamples (0.513 cm 3 ) of the medium were taken every 2 days. The subsamples were mixed with equal volumes of a 5% (w/v) zinc acetate solution to fix the volatile sulfide as zinc sulfide. The fixed subsamples were immediately frozen until photometric analysis. The samples were analyzed in replicates using IC. The IC system (Sykam GmbH, Fuerstenfeldbruck, Germany) was equipped with an LCA A 20 column, a suppressor (SAMS, SeQuant, Sweden) and a SYKAM S3115 conductivity detector. The mobile phase was a 1.8/1.7 mmol/l Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 mixture. Elution was performed at isocratic conditions. The eluent flow was set to 0.8 ml/min. A blank sample (deionized water) and a multi-compound standard containing each 50 mg/l formate, acetate, and oxalate (for the extraction of coal) were measured prior to each sample. Standard deviation of sample and standard quantification was below 10% (determined from replicate analysis). Hydrogen sulfide concentration was quantified according to Cline (1969) . In brief, 5 ml of deionized water and 400 μl of Clinereagent (1.6 g of N,N -dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate plus 2.4 g of FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O in 100 ml 50% HCl) are added to the sample. Adsorption is measured in a photometer at 680 nm after 20 min. The minimum detection limit with a 1 cm cell is around 50 μmol/l. The main organic compounds extracted with water at 5 MPa and 90˚C are formate, acetate, and oxalate. Vieth et al. (2008) reported comparable results from aqueous Soxhlet extraction of similar sample material from the DEBITS-1 well. The amounts of extracted LMWOAs increase over the course of the experiment (Figure 4, blue circles) . The strongest increase in concentration of LMWOAs was observed during the first 22 h of extraction. In the following 26 h a slow but steady increase of extracted LMWOA was observed, suggesting that the experiment did not run to completion after 48 h. Nevertheless, the yields of the extracted LMWOAs are approaching steady state. Total amounts of extracted LMWOAs after 48 h were 2.3 mg/g TOC formate, 3.8 mg/g TOC acetate, and 5.2 mg/g TOC oxalate. In the second coal extraction experiment we used an H 2 O-CO 2 mixture under the same pressure and temperature conditions (90˚C, 5 MPa) but with 2.4 mol/l CO 2 . Under these conditions, the same organic compounds (formate, acetate, and oxalate) were extracted (Figure 4, green circles) . Like in the experiment with deionized water, the amounts of extracted LMWOAs increase with increasing extraction time, with the main increase during the first 20 h. The total amounts of extracted LMWOAs after 48 h were 2.4 mg/gTOC for formate, 2.7 mg/gTOC for acetate, and 4.5 mg/gTOC for oxalate. These numbers are somewhat lower than in the pure water extraction experiment (Figure 4) . During the first 48 h of both IMV sediment incubation experiment, hydrogen sulfide concentration increased to about 0.3 mmol/l due to the mixing of the sediment's pore water hydrogen sulfide with the medium. Over the course of the first experiment the concentration remained around 0.3 mmol/l for the remainder of the experiment (Figure 5, red circles) . In the second experiment with the added methane (4 MPa, 96 mmol/l), sulfide concentration remained around 0.3 mmol/l until ca. 144 h, before increasing almost exponentially (Figure 5 , blue circles). The experiment was stopped after 432 h at a hydrogen sulfide concentration of 0.93 mmol/l.  The extracted LMWOAs (formate, acetate, and oxalate) have also been found to be the main organic acids obtained from water extraction of other low mature coals (Bou-Raad et al., 2000; Vieth et al., 2008; Glombitza, 2011) . High-pressure (5 MPa) extraction with pure water in our system resulted in significantly higher yields (2.4-4.5 mg organic acids/g TOC ) than what was reported from Soxhlet extraction of coal samples from a similar depth interval of the DEBITS-1 well, which yielded between 0.7 and 1.4 mg organic acid/g TOC for individual LMWOAs (Vieth et al., 2008) . The extraction of LMWOAs resulted in a decrease of pH in the extraction medium. The pH in Frontiers in Microbiology | Extreme Microbiology the reservoir of a Soxhlet apparatus decreases to approximately pH 4 after 48 h of extraction with deionized water (data not shown). However, the sample only gets into contact with freshly distilled water (pH 7) that drips over the sample. In the high-pressure system the extraction medium containing the extracted organic acids circulates through the system, thereby extracting the coal with a low-pH medium. The lower pH is supposed to enhance the release of LMWOAs from macromolecular organic matter in the coal by hydrolysis (Glombitza, 2011) . This might explain the higher extraction yields of LMWOAs in our reactor system as compared to Soxhlet extraction. Under in situ conditions, the extracted LMWOAs will remain in the pore water and thereby cause a drop in pH before they are eventually removed by diffusion or fluid flow. As Fry et al. (2009) reported from samples from the DEBITS-1 well, the majority of microbial activity and abundance is not found in the coals but rather in the surrounding and more porous sandstones. So the consumption of the produced LMWOA does not take place inside the coal seams but above or below them and removal of these substances from the coals is controlled by diffusion or fluid flow, not by microbial activity. It is therefore reasonable to assume that our high-pressure system provides reaction conditions that are much more realistic than Soxhlet extraction because the extracted compounds are not removed from the reaction. When comparing the results of the first extraction with deionized water and the second extraction with an H 2 O-CO 2 mixture, it becomes obvious that CO 2 reduces the amount of extracted acetate by a factor of 1.39 and oxalate by a factor of 1.16. For formate no clear influence of CO 2 on the extraction efficiency could be observed. At first sight, this result is surprising because carbon dioxide dissolved in water lowers the pH due to formation of carbonic acid (Meyassami et al., 1992) . The lower pH was expected to enhance hydrolysis and, therefore, increase the yield of extractable LMWOAs. However, we observed a suppressing effect of CO 2 . The LMWOAs found in the extraction fluid may not just result from the actual extraction of the coal but also from different secondary reactions. It was suggested that oxalate in aqueous extracts of coals is a result of the decomposition of 1,2-dihydroxycarboxylic acids (Bou-Raad et al., 2000) . Therefore it has to be assumed that at least for oxalate (and maybe for other LMWOAs as well) the extraction yield is not only affected by hydrolysis but also by secondary reactions, which may be inhibited or suppressed in the presence of CO 2 in the extraction medium. The incubation experiment with sediment samples from the Isis mud volcano clearly showed the positive effect of elevated methane concentration on the rate of sulfide production, which is a direct result of sulfate reduction. Omoregie et al. (2009) conducted whole core 35 SO 2− 4 radiotracer incubations of samples from the same mud volcano at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) and with a maximum methane concentration of >10 μmol l −1 . They measured sulfate reduction rates of 7-240 nmol cm −3 day −1 . We conducted our experiment at much higher methane concentration (96 mmol l −1 ) and in situ pressure (10 MPa), and measured a significantly higher sulfate reduction rate of ca. 2000 nmol cm −3 day −1 , which we attribute to the elevated methane concentration, as already shown by Nauhaus et al. (2002) . The aim of this paper is to present a new high-pressure incubation system and experiments to demonstrate the application of elevated temperature and pressure as well the use of elevated gas saturation and their effects on geochemical and microbiological processes. Therefore, we can only speculate about the reasons for the observed suppressing effect of the CO 2 . This effect still remains puzzling and will be the topic of future investigations.  The high-pressure high-temperature incubation system is a moderately priced alternative to existing systems. Furthermore, it is easy to construct and to handle. Initial experiments demonstrate that the system is suitable for a wide range of applications in geo-and bio-sciences. The system allows the incubations at elevated pressure and temperature conditions (up to 120˚C and 60 MPa) as well as manipulating the dissolved gases throughout the experiment. The system also allows subsampling of the fluid phase during the course of the experiment without decompression. Extraction of a sub-bituminous coal samples under high-pressure and temperature conditions showed a higher yield in LMWOAs from macromolecular organic matter as compared to an extraction with a Soxhlet apparatus. The high-pressure extraction of the coal sample with CO 2 -saturated water revealed a suppressing effect of the CO 2 on the extraction yield or secondary formations of LMWOAs. Possible reasons for this effect are not identified yet and will be in the focus of future investigations. The incubation of sediment samples from a mud volcano harboring sulfate-reducing methanotrophs showed a clear positive response of methane addition on the sulfate reduction rate. Our high-pressure high-temperature incubation system has proven its suitability for a broad range of scientific applications.

24825330,"Microbial community of a saline mud volcano at San Biagio‐Belpasso, Mt. Etna (Italy)","Summary ::: ::: In San Biagio of Belpasso, approximately 20 km south of Mt. Etna, in the area of contact between volcanic and sedimentary formations, a number of small (3– 60 cm in diameter) active mud eruptions discharge CO2-rich gases, mud and NaCl brines. They can be described as mini-volcanoes owing to their typical conic shapes and continuously bubbling peak craters. Samples were collected from the active peak craters at a depth of 20 cm and DNA was immediately extracted and amplified with universal 16S rRNA gene-specific primers, followed by cloning procedure. A total of 140 bacterial clones obtained were screened and clustered by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The pool of 16S rRNA sequences representing each RFLP cluster was subjected to phylogenetic analysis. All of the 33 sequences analysed were affiliated with the kingdom of Eubacteria; 28 sequences (77% of all clones) affiliated with the Proteobacteria, two sequences (19% of all clones) were affiliated with Actinobacteria and three sequences (4% of all clones) were affiliated with the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides division. The data obtained suggest that the microorganisms phylogenetically affiliated to autotrophic methane oxidizers and heterotrophic hydrocarbon degraders belonging to the gamma-subclass of Proteobacteria are major constituents of the microbial communities of the saline volcanic muds. Overall, the composition of the microbial community of the San Biagio mud volcano resembles the compositions of marine microbial communities, which might indicate that wind-blown seawater vapour acted as an inoculum for microbial community described in present work.",N/A,Michail Yakimov,2002,12030850,10.1046/j.1462-2920.2002.00293.x
20023799,Activity and interactions of methane seep microorganisms assessed by parallel transcription and FISH-NanoSIMS analyses,"To characterize the activity and interactions of methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and Deltaproteobacteria at a methane-seeping mud volcano, we used two complimentary measures of microbial activity: a community-level analysis of the transcription of four genes (16S rRNA, methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA), adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase α-subunit (aprA), dinitrogenase reductase (nifH)), and a single-cell-level analysis of anabolic activity using fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled to nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (FISH-NanoSIMS). Transcript analysis revealed that members of the deltaproteobacterial groups Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) and Desulfobulbaceae (DSB) exhibit increased rRNA expression in incubations with methane, suggestive of ANME-coupled activity. Direct analysis of anabolic activity in DSS cells in consortia with ANME by FISH-NanoSIMS confirmed their dependence on methanotrophy, with no 15NH4+ assimilation detected without methane. In contrast, DSS and DSB cells found physically independent of ANME (i.e., single cells) were anabolically active in incubations both with and without methane. These single cells therefore comprise an active ‘free-living’ population, and are not dependent on methane or ANME activity. We investigated the possibility of N2 fixation by seep Deltaproteobacteria and detected nifH transcripts closely related to those of cultured diazotrophic Deltaproteobacteria. However, nifH expression was methane-dependent. 15N2 incorporation was not observed in single DSS cells, but was detected in single DSB cells. Interestingly, 15N2 incorporation in single DSB cells was methane-dependent, raising the possibility that DSB cells acquired reduced 15N products from diazotrophic ANME while spatially coupled, and then subsequently dissociated. With this combined data set we address several outstanding questions in methane seep microbial ecosystems and highlight the benefit of measuring microbial activity in the context of spatial associations.","Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and its consumption by microbes in methane seep sediment reduces its release into the overlying water column (Reeburgh, 2007) . The oxidation of methane in seep sediments is mediated primarily by three groups of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME): ANME-1 (Orphan et al., 2002) , ANME-2 (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001b) and ANME-3 (Niemann et al., 2006; Lösekann et al., 2007) . Although they can be detected as single cells or monospecific aggregates (Orphan et al., 2002 , Lösekann et al., 2007 , ANME, and particularly ANME-2 and ANME-3, are typically found in direct physical association with Deltaproteobacteria. ANME-2 associate with three distinct groups of putatively sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria: (1) SEEP-SRB1, members of Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) within the Desulfobacteraceae (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a) ; (2) SEEP-SRB2, a deeply branching deltaproteobacterial group originally described as the Eel-2 group (Orphan et al., 2001a; Kleindienst et al., 2012) ; and (3) SEEP-DBB, within the Desulfobulbaceae (DSB) (Pernthaler et al., 2008; Green-Saxena et al., 2014) . ANME-3 have been shown to associate with relatives of SEEP-SRB3 within the DSB (Niemann et al., 2006; Lösekann et al., 2007) . Although the chemical interaction between ANME-2/-3 and the associated Deltaproteobacteria remains an area of active research (Moran et al., 2008; Milucka et al., 2012) , the associated Deltaproteobacteria are traditionally thought to mediate sulfate reduction, consuming the reduced products of ANME-2/-3 methane oxidation and driving the thermodynamic favorability of the anaerobic oxidation of methane (Hoehler et al., 1994; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001b; Hallam et al., 2004; Alperin and Hoehler, 2009) . Deltaproteobacteria, including DSS and DSB, are also detected as physically independent (i.e., single) cells within methane seep sediment, comprising 5-20% (410 8 cells per cm 3 ) of the non-ANMEassociated population (Knittel et al., 2003; Schreiber et al., 2010; Kleindienst et al., 2012) . Although often referred to as 'free-living' cells, it is not known if single DSS and DSB are active when physically independent of ANME. In one study, it was suggested that the presence of abundant single DSB cells at an oil field site was because of disruption of the ANME-DSB association, rather than the presence of a truly free-living population (Schreiber et al., 2010) . If they are active, how their physiology compares with their ANME-associated counterparts, and particularly whether they are dependent on methane, as ANME-associated Deltaproteobacteria appear to be (Nauhaus et al., 2002; Dekas et al., 2009 Dekas et al., , 2014 , remain intriguing questions. Direct characterization of the activity of single versus ANME-associated Deltaproteobacteria is challenging, because standard experiments (e.g., sulfate reduction rates, enzyme activity and phylogenetic or isotope analyses of bulk-extracted biomolecules, including DNA, RNA or lipids) cannot differentiate between phylogenetically similar organisms occupying distinct spatial niches. Most studies investigating single seep Deltaproteobacteria have focused on their abundance, distribution and phylogenetic identity, without assessing their activity or ecological function (Knittel et al., 2003; Lösekann et al., 2007; Schreiber et al., 2010; Kleindienst et al., 2012) . There is therefore a great deal of uncertainty related to what fraction of the single-cell assemblage is active, what their metabolic capabilities entail and if and how they interact with the ANMEDeltaproteobacteria consortia. Recently, nitrogen fixation, the biological conversion of N 2 to NH 3 , has been observed in methane seep sediment from the Eel River Basin (ERB) and Mound 12 Costa Rica (Dekas et al., 2009 . Although ANME-2 archaea were identified as the primary diazotrophs at Mound 12, a wide diversity of dinitrogenase reductase (nifH) gene sequences have been described from Mound 12 as well as other deep-sea methane seeps, raising the possibility that multiple members of the community are able to fix nitrogen (Dang et al., 2009; Dekas et al., 2009 Dekas et al., , 2014 Miyazaki et al., 2009) . Putatively sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, including DSS and DSB, are candidates for additional seep N 2 fixation, both because some seep-recovered nifH sequences show high similarity to those of cultured diazotrophic sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, and beacause N 2 fixation mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria has been observed in shallow marine sediments (Bertics et al., 2010 (Bertics et al., , 2012 Fulweiler et al., 2013) . Therefore, if single seep Deltaproteobacteria are indeed active, they may be a source of bioavailable nitrogen to the seep ecosystem. Here, we sought to determine if single DSS and DSB cells in methane seep sediment (1) are active, (2) are dependent on methane and/or ANME activity and (3) if they fix nitrogen. To this end, we investigated the activity of bacteria and archaea in sediment collected at Mound 12 Costa Rica in microcosm experiments amended with methane or argon, and either 15 NH 4 + or 15 N 2 . We investigated the microbial community composition, activity and response to methane with an analysis of DNA and RNA (rRNA and mRNA). We then measured anabolic activity and/or diazotrophic ability in single DSB, single DSS, ANME-2-associated DSS, ANME-1 and ANME-2 in the presence and absence of methane with fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled to secondary ion mass spectrometry (FISH-NanoSIMS). With this combined data set, we were also able to address several additional outstanding questions in seep microbial ecosystems, including if ANME-2 are anabolically active in the absence of methane, whether ANME-1 and ANME-2 display differences in anabolic activity and if there is a phylogenetic diversity of active diazotrophs in Costa Rican seep sediment.  Seafloor sediment push cores investigated in this study were collected using the manned submersible Alvin and R/V Atlantis in October 2006 (cruise number AT15-11) within methane seep sites in the ERB Southern Ridge (~40°47.192′N, 124°35.706′W; 520 m water depth; 5°C in situ water temperature) and in January 2010 (cruise number AT15-59) at Mound 12, Costa Rica (~8°55.8′N, 84°18.7′W; 988 m water depth; 5°C in situ water temperature). Sediment cores were immediately stored at 4°C and extruded from push core liners in 3 cm increments on-board within 2 h after recovery of the submersible. Sediment samples were either stored in Mylar bags flushed with argon (Ar) at 4°C (ERB) or immediately combined with Ar-sparged filtered seawater and aliquoted into anaerobic serum bottles (CR). Push cores used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. 15 N-labeling microcosm incubations As described in Dekas et al. (2009 Dekas et al. ( , 2014 , sediments were homogenized with Ar-sparged artificial marine media (ERB) or with filtered bottom water collected near core sampling (CR). Sediment slurries were aliquoted into 140 ml (ERB) N 2 and Ar) was also analyzed here, to confirm NanoSIMS results observed in CR17. All analyses reported here were conducted on CR incubations, except the FISH-NanoSIMS analysis of ANME-1 cells, which were conducted on ERB incubations, because of low numbers of ANME-1 cells in the CR sediment. The time points investigated were selected based on trends in 15 N incorporation and sulfide production and over time: 139-day subsamples (~5 months, Costa Rica incubations) and 168-day subsamples (6 months, ERB incubations). Given the long doubling time of ANME-Deltaproteobacteria consortia (estimated 3-7 months; Girguis et al., 2005; Nauhaus et al., 2007; Krueger et al., 2008; Orphan et al., 2009) , long incubations times are necessary to observe the synthesis of new biomass via 15 N incorporation, particularly when N 2 serves as nitrogen source (Dekas et al., 2009) . Non-target, DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained cells were analyzed to ensure that excessive recycling of substrates did not occur. DNA and RNA extractions and reverse transcription reactions DNA and RNA were extracted simultaneously from 1 ml of frozen sediment slurry using the RNA Powersoil Total RNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA; cat. no. 12866-25) and the RNA Powersoil DNA Elution Accessory Kit (MOBIO Laboratories; cat. no. 12867-25) . The extraction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the following modification: after the addition of solution SR2, the mixture was divided into four 2-ml screw top tubes and cells mechanically lysed using a Bio 101 FastPrep FP120 bead beater (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) for 45 s at a speed of 5.5 three times. The RNA extracts were treated with the Ambion TURBO DNA-free Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; cat. no. AM1907), and cleaned using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Hilden, Germany; cat. no. 74104), following the RNA Clean-up Protocol provided by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA was completed using Superscript III First Strand Synthesis Supermix (ThermoFisher Scientific; cat. no. 18080-400). DNA and cDNA clone libraries Traditional Sanger sequencing of clone libraries was performed to obtain near full-length 16S rRNA sequences (in contrast to the shorter reads provided by higher throughput alternatives) to enable superior phylogenetic analysis and comparison with regions used in FISH oligonucleotide probe design. Fourteen libraries were generated from RNA and DNA extracted simultaneously from incubations of AD4587 PC6 sediment of the 3-6 cm horizon at the 20-week time point: CR15 ( 15 N 2 with CH 4 headspace) and CR17 ( 15 N 2 with Ar headspace). Twentyfive microliters of PCR reactions containing 1 μl each of 10 μM forward and reverse primer, 1 μl template (5-16 ng DNA or cDNA), 2.5 μl of 10 × ExTaq PCR buffer (Takara, Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), 0.3 μl of 5 U μl − 1 ExTaq (Takara), 0.5 μl of 10 mM dNTPs (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 0.5 μl of 10 μg μl − 1 bovine serum albumin and 18.2 μl water were performed. The following primer sets were used: nifHf_10aa and nifHr_132aa (Mehta et al., 2003) to target dinitrogenase reductase (nifH), mcrA_F and mcrA_R modified from (Luton et al., 2002) to target methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA), AprA-1-FW and AprA-5-RV (Meyer and Kuever, 2007) to target adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate reductase α-subunit (aprA) and 27 F and 1492 R modified from Lane (1991) to target the 16S rRNA gene. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2 , and PCR conditions in Supplementary Table 3 . No amplicon was visible in any of the RNA-only reactions (no-RT reaction) when 4 μl were run on an agarose gel. PCR products were plate purified (Millipore Multiscreen filter plates; ref. no. MSNU03010), ligated with the Invitrogen TOPO TA Cloning Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific; cat. no. K457501) and transformed using Top Ten chemically competent Escherichia coli cells. Picked colonies were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth and amplified using M13 primers for 30 cycles. The M13 products were visualized to confirm the correct size insert, plate purified and sent for unidirectional sequencing using T3 primers at Laragen Sequencing (Culver City, CA, USA). For the 16S rRNA library, clones that were identified as Deltaproteobacteria after unidirectional sequencing were sent for reverse sequencing with T7 primers. All unique, full-length sequences were deposited into GenBank with the following accession numbers: KR813881-KR814285 (16S rRNA), KR020406-KR020496 (nifH), KR812737-KR813018 (aprA) and KR812576-KR812736 (mcrA). Sequences derived from CR15 begin 'CH4-' and sequences derived from CR17 begin 'Ar-'. All sequences were trimmed, examined for quality and stitched (16S rRNA deltaproteobacterial sequences only) using Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Two 16S rRNA gene trees were inferred by maximum likelihood using PhyML package (Guindon et al., 2010) and the HKY evolutionary model in the software program ARB version 5.5 (Ludwig et al., 2004) . The bacterial positional variability filter was provided within the SSURef-111-SILVA-NR database (Quast et al., 2013) . The reliability of the trees was estimated by bootstrapping in Geneious version 7.0.4 (Kearse et al., 2012) using PhyML maximum likelihood, the HKY model and 100 replicates. The 16S rRNA identification of all clones was also checked using the SSURef-119-SILVA-NR database. The aprA sequences were translated in ARB and aligned with MUSCLE (MUltiple Sequence Comparison by LogExpectation). The aprA phylogeny was computed using MrBayes (Ronquist et al., 2012) . Convergence was determined by an average standard deviation of split frequencies o0.01. The nifH and mcrA sequences were translated in Geneious and aligned using ClustalW. The nifH and mcrA trees were generated by maximum likelihood (PhyML) using the LG substitution model (Le and Gascuel, 2008) , with branch support estimated using the approximate likelihood ratio test (Anisimova and Gascuel, 2006) . FISH-NanoSIMS was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed ANME-Deltaproteobacteria consortia and/or single cells from CR8, CR17, CR18 and CR45 (139-day time point), and ERB1C and ERB5A (168-day time point) using previously described protocols (Dekas and Orphan, 2011) . CR8 rather than CR15 was investigated to pair the single-cell FISHNanoSIMS analyses performed here with the ANME-2 consortia FISH-NanoSIMS analyses performed previously (reported in Dekas et al., 2014) . CR8 and CR15 are analogous incubations: both contained sediment collected under microbial mats from Mound 12, both sediment inoculum horizons were proposed to be the methane-sulfate transition zone based on ANME abundance, their sediment inoculum showed similar diversity in nifH sequences and both showed methane-dependent sulfide production and nitrogen fixation . Sediment was centrifuged in a 1:1 phosphatebuffered saline:Percoll gradient (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA; P4937), followed by filtration on a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene fluoride filter (Durapore Membrane Filter; EMD Millipore, Hayward, CA, USA). Damp filters were flipped onto slides, depositing cells on the slide surface (custom-cut glass squares coated with indium tin oxide or glass rounds). Catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) was conducted following the protocols in Pernthaler et al. (2002) and Pernthaler and Pernthaler (2007) using the following horseradish peroxidase-labeled probes: DSS_658 (Boetius et al., 2000) , seepDBB_653 (Green-Saxena et al., 2014) and ANME-1_350 (Boetius et al., 2000) . Probe sequences and formamide concentrations are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Tyramides conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 were used in the CARD-FISH amplification reactions. Hybridizations with DSS_658 and seepDBB_653 were conducted sequentially on the same samples. Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Consortia containing both cells positively hybridized with the DSS_658 probe and unhybridized, DAPI-stained cells were identified as ANME-DSS consortia for NanoSIMS analysis. To support this identification, mono-label FISH experiments (as described in Orphan et al., 2002) were conducted on sediment from the same incubations using probes DSS_658 and EelMS_932 (targeting ANME-2) (Boetius et al., 2000) . These experiments demonstrated that 490% of cell clusters containing DSS cells were indeed ANME-2-DSS aggregates (Supplementary Figure 1B) . Cells of interest were imaged and mapped using 60× (PlanApo; Olympus, Shinjuku, Tokyo), 40× (UPlanFLN; Olympus) and 10× (Plan-Neofluar; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) objectives on a Delta Vision RT microscope and Softworx software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA, USA). A CAMECA NanoSIMS 50 l housed at Caltech (Pasadena, CA, USA), operated with a mass resolving power of~5000, was used to analyze specific cells identified with FISH. Cells deposited on glass were gold coated before NanoSIMS analysis. were collected at 256 × 256 or 512 × 512 pixels resolution, for 0.5-5 h. Clostridia spores with known isotopic composition (previously analyzed by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry) were used as standards. Images were processed using L'Image software (developed by L Nittler, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, DC, USA). Combining DNA and RNA Investigations with FISH-NanoSIMS Investigating the activity of microbes within natural samples is a focus of environmental microbiology, and a key to understanding the role of microbes in biogeochemical cycles. Here, we investigated the occurrence (DNA) and expression (RNA) of four key genes in methane seep sediment from Mound 12 Costa Rica incubated with either CH 4 or Ar to assess the potential activity of seep microorganisms. We analyzed 16S bacterial rRNA, to target the bacterial community, aprA, to target sulfur-cycling microbes, mcrA, to target methanotrophs and methanogens and nifH, to target organisms capable of N 2 fixation (diazotrophs). Although RNA provides a more accurate assessment of microbial activity than DNA, the detection of rRNA and/or mRNA is still an imperfect proxy (see discussion in Blazewicz et al., 2013) . Ribosomes can be detected in dormant cells (e.g., Sukenik et al., 2012) , and posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation can lead to decoupling of mRNA expression, protein synthesis and enzyme activity (e.g., Kessler and Leigh, 1999; Liang et al., 1991; Waldbauer et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 1993) . Additionally, although RNA in deceased cells is generally thought to degrade quickly, the lifetime of transcripts in the environment-particularly in cold anoxic sediments-is poorly understood, and there is some evidence for survival of RNA post-mortem (Fordyce et al., 2013) . It is therefore beneficial to combine community-level RNA analysis with direct measurements of cellular activity when possible. Consequently, we follow our RNA analysis with direct measurements of microbial anabolic activity using FISH-NanoSIMS. We measure uptake of 15 N 2 and 15 NH 4 + to directly detect diazotrophic activity (N 2 fixation) and overall anabolic activity, respectively (Krueger et al., 2008; Orphan et al., 2009) . In addition to providing a more definitive measure of microbial activity, FISH-NanoSIMS observes activity in the context of spatial associations, allowing the differentiation of activity between phylogenetically similar microbes occupying different spatial niches (e.g., Deltaproteobacteria in association with ANME versus physically independent). Despite the benefits of FISH-NanoSIMS analysis, single-cell isotope analysis remains a timeconsuming and expensive procedure, precluding the analysis of more than a small subset of cells within a community. The two methods are therefore complimentary: we use the DNA and RNA analysis to obtain a broad community perspective of the organisms present and potentially active under different experimental conditions, and targeted FISHNanoSIMS analyses to both validate trends seen in our RNA analysis and test specific hypotheses generated by the RNA analysis. We detected all three major groups of ANME at Mound 12 (Figures 1a and b) . mcrA groups a-e have been paired with the 16S rRNA identities of the ANME previously: mcrA groups a and b belong to ANME-1, c and d to ANME-2c, e to ANME-2a and f to ANME-3 (Hallam et al., 2003; Lösekann et al., 2007; Meyerdierks et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014) . In the methane incubation, ANME-1-affiliated mcrA sequences were recovered from the DNA-based survey (6% of the library), with a single ANME-1-affiliated clone detected in the cDNA library (1% of the library) (Figures 1a and b) . ANME-2-and ANME-3-affiliated mcrA sequences together dominated the DNA library (46% and 49%, respectively), but transcripts affiliated with ANME-3 were not detected (Figures 1a and b) . mcrA transcripts were also detected in the Ar incubation (Figures 1a and b) . Notably, PCR amplification of mcrA in cDNA from the Ar incubation was significantly less than that from the CH 4 incubation, determined by visualization of the PCR product via gel electrophoresis. From this library, 18 mcrA sequences were obtained, all belonging to the ANME-2c-affiliated group c/d, and highly similar to mcrA transcripts recovered from the methane treatment ( Figures 1a and b and Supplementary Figure 2) . Three primary possibilities may explain the detection of these mcrA transcripts in the absence of methane: ANME methanotrophy fueled by in situ methane production, methanogenesis by ANME or low turnover of mcrA transcripts. Methanogenesis by ANME has been proposed in other sediments based on thermodynamic calculations (Alperin and Hoehler, 2009) , as well as environmental observations including the detection of ANME-1 16S rRNA and mcrA transcripts within methanogenic zones of sediment cores (Lloyd et al., 2011) , direct natural abundance δ 13 C measurements of ANME-1 and ANME-2 cells ) and contemporaneous detection of methane production and oxidation in ANME-dominated sediments (Orcutt et al., 2005 (Orcutt et al., , 2008 House et al., 2009 ). However, as described above, detection of transcripts does not definitively indicate activity. We therefore employed FISH-NanoSIMS to determine if the detection of ANME-2-affiliated mcrA transcripts in the Ar incubation coincided with anabolic activity. ANME-DSS consortia: anabolically active in the absence of CH 4 ? To determine if ANME-2-DSS consortia were anabolically active without methane, we measured uptake of 15 NH 4 + by ANME-2-DSS consortia in the Ar incubation via FISH-NanoSIMS. FISH using oligonucleotide probes EelMS_932 and DSS_658 revealed the occurrence of intact, ribosome-containing ANME-2-DSS consortia in the absence of methane for 9 months, without statistically significant changes in abundance or morphology (CR17 and CR18; Supplementary Figure 1) . Previous FISH-NanoSIMS analyses showed no 15 N incorporation from 15 N 2 by ANME-2-DSS aggregates in the absence of methane in incubation CR17 , but left open the possibility of non-diazotrophic anabolic activity. Here, we demonstrated that general anabolic activity ( 15 NH 4 + uptake) by ANME-2-DSS consortia was also below detection after 14 months of incubation without methane (n = 4 consortia, including~550 cells, calculated assuming average cell volume of 1 μm 3 , CR18); (Figures 2c and 3a) . The lack of 15 NH 4 + uptake demonstrates that although they persist without methane, and are detected by FISH, the ANME-2 and associated DSS cells investigated were anabolically dormant without methane. Anabolic dormancy in this subset of the population suggests that ANME-2-mediated Figure 1 Relative abundance of genes and transcripts detected in 14 clone libraries generated from DNA and cDNA derived from Mound 12 sediment incubated with CH 4 or Ar. In (a and b), Deltaproteobacteria are in color, with DSB-affiliated sequences in orange and Desulfobacteraceae-affiliated sequences in yellow. In (c), green bars highlight phylotypes demonstrating higher relative transcription with CH 4 .

(2004) ; 4 grouping as defined by Hallam et al. (2003) . methanogenesis, or methanotrophy fueled by in situ methane production, coupled to growth, is not widespread in this community. These results also suggest that ANME-2-associated DSS are typically dependent on ANME activity (and/or directly on methane), and do not fully disassociate or recover the ability to grow independently of ANME/methane even after months in the absence of active methanotrophy. However, because of the targeted nature of FISH-NanoSIMS, even with the analysis of~550 cells, we cannot eliminate the possibility of 15 NH 4 incorporation in a subset of the ANME-2-and/or ANME-associated DSS populations not included in our analysis. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes recovered from Mound 12 revealed a bacterial assemblage typical of methane seep habitats, including a large fraction of bacteria likely involved in sulfur cycling (Figures 1a and b) . We detected three of the four uncultured, seep-specific putatively sulfate-reducing clades: SEEP-SRB1, SEEP-SRB3 and SEEP-SRB4, all of which expressed rRNA (Figure 4) . Interestingly although transcripts belonging to the DSB clades SEEP-SRB3 and Seep-DBB were detected in the cDNA (together comprising up to 18% of the cDNA libraries), no SEEP-SRB3 or Seep-DBB genes were detected in the DNA clone libraries (n = 199 clones) (Figures 1a and b) . Their presence and ecological contribution may therefore be overlooked by investigations of DNA alone, using conventional cloning and sequencing methods. The aprA gene sequences recovered were split nearly evenly between those of sulfate-reducing bacteria (aprA groups SRB I and II) and sulfideoxidizing bacteria (aprA groups SOB I and II), but the transcripts were dominated by SRB sequences (Figures 1a and b and Supplementary Figure 3) . Sulfate reduction is therefore likely more prevalent than sulfide oxidation in these incubations, consistent with the net production of sulfide observed over time . Few DSB aprA sequences were detected in DNA or cDNA, which is surprising given the abundance of DSB 16S rRNA sequences in the cDNA. Although this could suggest that the aprA sequences of the uncultured DSB groups detected do not cluster with the aprA sequences of cultured DSB, the disparity may also be because of mismatches in the aprA primer set to the aprA sequences of seep DSB. The aprA reverse primer contained two or more mismatches to the aprA genes within a DSB-linked metagenomic bin from a Hydrate Ridge methane seep (Connor Skennerton and Victoria Orphan, unpublished data). Therefore, the lack of DSB aprA sequences cannot be commented on. Differences in bacterial expression with methane: ANME-coupled activity? Because of the important role Deltaproteobacteria likely play in the anaerobic oxidation of methane, there is great interest in identifying Deltaproteobacteria in metabolic partnerships with ANME. Previous studies have used FISH to visualize bacteria physically associated with ANME (e.g., Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001b; Niemann et al., 2006; Lösekann et al., 2007; Pernthaler et al., 2008; Schreiber et al., 2010; Holler et al., 2011; Kleindienst et al., 2012; Vigneron et al., 2014 ). In the current study, we utilized a different approach to detect bacterial lineages with ANME-coupled activity, by observing differential 16S rRNA gene expression with and without methane. Bacterial lineages whose metabolisms are positively linked with ANME activity were expected to display higher relative levels of rRNA expression in the presence of methane (i.e., when ANME are active) than without. Unlike FISH, this approach does not require that metabolic partners are physically associated to be detected. The two bacterial groups with the largest increase in 16S rRNA expression with CH 4 were SEEP-SRB1 and SEEP-SRB3 (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 4) . Indeed, SEEP-SRB1 transcripts were only detected with methane, suggesting that Seep-SRB1 are dependent on Effect of methane on microbial activity in seep sediment AE Dekas et al methane and/or ANME activity. This is consistent with the FISH-NanoSIMS observation that ANME-associated DSS were anabolically dormant without methane (Figure 2 ), as well as numerous previous reports showing SEEP-SRB1 in association with ANME-2 (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001a; Pernthaler et al., 2008; Schreiber et al., 2010; Dekas et al., 2014) . Seep-SRB3 have not been observed in direct association with ANME. Members of a sister group to Seep-SRB3 associate with ANME-3 (Lösekann et al., 2007) , but the Seep-SRB3 clones demonstrating methane-enhanced transcription here are distinct from the ANME-3 partner (Supplementary Figure 4) . Additionally, mcrA transcripts affiliated with ANME-3 were not detected in these incubations (Figures 1a and b) . The observation of enhanced rRNA expression in the presence of methane, although currently uncorroborated by additional data sets, suggest that members of Seep-SRB3 may benefit from methane and/or ANME-2 activity and warrants further investigation. Are single cells of DSS and DSB active, comprising a truly 'free-living' population? To differentiate activity between ANME-associated and single Deltaproteobacteria, we analyzed 15 NH 4 + uptake in individual cells with NanoSIMS. We used CARD-FISH with the oligonucleotide probe DSS_658 to target members of DSS (which includes the SEEP-SRB1 group; Knittel et al., 2003; Schreiber et al., 2010) , and probe seepDBB_653 to target a broad group within the DSB, including members of SEEP-DBB and SEEP-SRB3/Desulfobulbus (Supplementary Table 4) . We detect the uptake of 15 NH 4 + in individual DSS and DSB cells in the absence of CH 4 (DSS: n = 7 cells, 7/7 15 N-enriched; DSB: n = 7 cells, 4/7 15 N-enriched; CR18). This indicates that both singlecell populations targeted by our FISH probes contain members that are anabolically active and not dependent on either CH 4 or ANME activity (Figures 2c and 3b, c) . Additionally, compared with the lack of 15 NH 4 + incorporation in ANME-associated DSS in the same incubation (Figures 2c and 3a) , the 15 NH 4 + incorporation measured in all single DSS cells suggests potentially fundamental physiological and likely phylogenetic differences between ANME-associated and physically independent DSS cells. In support of this, the aprA transcripts related to Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae recovered from the CH 4 and Ar treatments were largely associated with different clades (Supplementary Figure 3) . ). a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1: CARD-FISH images show DSB (probe seepDBB_653), DSS (probe DSS_658) and ANME-1 (probe ANME-1_350), counterstained with DAPI (blue) as indicated.

The isotope images show data only for pixels that exceed a threshold for total 12 C − counts (10-30% of the maximum 12 C − counts in the image); these areas are enclosed by white outlines and may include more area compared with the cell of interest because of the presence of non-cellular carbon-containing particles and/or extracellular polymeric substance (EPS).

Scale bars in (a2, d2 and d3) are 5 μm; all others are 1 μm. Are diverse diazotrophs present and active in Mound 12 sediment? A diversity of nifH sequences was detected in DNA extracted from the CH 4 incubation (CR15), consistent with nifH diversity observed in hotspots of productivity in the deep sea, including methane seeps, mud volcanoes and hydrothermal vents (Mehta et al., 2003; Dang et al., 2009; Dekas et al., 2009; Miyazaki et al., 2009) (Figures 1a, b and 5) . A nifH DNA clone library was previously generated Figure 4 16S rRNA gene tree inferred with maximum-likelihood, HKY evolutionary model and 100 bootstraps. Sequences from this study are in bold. cDNA clones are larger and in color, with clones incubated with CH 4 in red (incubation CR15), and Ar in blue (incubation CR17). For brevity, only a representative subset of the clones from this study is included in the tree. The total number of clones from each library that fall within the group of the clone shown (defined by the last well-supported branch, and indicated by the black square) is included within parentheses. Purple and green phylogenetic labels indicate DSB and Desulfobacteraceae, respectively. Bootstrap support of 70 or greater is shown. The scale bar indicates the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site. One thousand three hundred and seven nucleotides were used to infer the tree. *A shorter sequence (866-987 bp) that was inserted into the tree by parsimony. **A more detailed version of this portion of the tree can be found in Supplementary Figure 4 .

NCBI accession numbers are shown. from the same sediment sample immediately upon collection (not incubated) , and the nifH diversity and proportions recovered in that library and the library reported here (after 4 months of incubation with CH 4 ) are highly similar ( Figure 1a) . The similarity suggests that the experimental incubation contains a diazotrophic assemblage representative of the in situ population. We detected nifH transcripts in the CH 4 incubation, but not in the Ar incubation, consistent with previous work demonstrating methane-dependent nitrogen fixation at Mound 12 (Figure 1 ). This suggests that the diazotrophs are either dependent on methane (e.g., methanotrophs) or dependent on the products of the ANME (e.g., ANME-associated Deltaproteobacteria). ANME-2 fix nitrogen in methane seep sediment (Dekas et al., 2009) Miyazaki et al., 2009 ) has been putatively assigned to the ANME-2 archaea (Dekas et al., 2009; Miyazaki et al., 2009) , and our analysis supports this assignment with the placement of a nifH sequence recovered from an ANME-2a genome within this clade (Wang et al., 2014) (Figure 5 ). Interestingly, only 41% of the clones recovered in this study fall within the ANME-2-affiliated methane seep clade, whereas 49% fall within group III (49%) ( Figure 5 ). Group III contains nifH sequences from a range of anaerobic microbes, including methanogens and Deltaproteobacterial sulfate-reducing bacteria. The transcription of these sequences suggests multiple methane-dependent diazotrophs within the sediments, potentially including ANME phylotypes in addition to ANME-2, or SRB with ANME-coupled activity. Nitrogen fixation by ANME-associated Deltaproteobacteria is one possibility. DSS and DSB associated with ANME demonstrate 15 N enrichment in the presence of 15 N 2 and methane (Dekas et al., 2009 . Although this may be because of N sharing with the diazotrophic ANME-2, additional nitrogen fixation by the associated Deltaproteobacteriaalthough at lower rates-is also possible. Consistent with this, the nif genes recovered from nearly purified ANME-2c consortia in previous work were affiliated with both Methanosarcina-like and deltaproteobacterial nif sequences (Pernthaler et al., 2008) . Why closely associated partners would both fix nitrogen is unclear, and to our knowledge, unprecedented. It raises the possibility that nitrogen fixation in these organisms is not because of N limitation, which could be overcome by an N 2 -fixing symbiont, but rather for other benefits only realized by the diazotroph itself. Further analyses, including metatranscriptomics/metaproteomics of individual ANME-Deltaproteobacteria consortia and/or immunolabeling of nitrogenase would be necessary to differentiate between the possibilities of N sharing between the diazotrophic ANME and associated Deltaproteobacteria, versus independent nitrogen fixation in both. Are ANME-1, single DSS and single DSB capable of N 2 fixation? To investigate whether the diversity of nifH transcripts could be because of a diversity of diazotrophs in the single-cell population, we investigated 15 N 2 assimilation in single ANME-1, DSS and DSB cells using FISH-NanoSIMS. ANME-1 contain nif homologs, and although they are inferred to be non-functional in nitrogen fixation based on their phylogenetic placement within nifH group IV , we directly tested their ability to fix nitrogen in this study. Sediment from the ERB previously shown to host diazotrophic ANME-2 was chosen for this experiment rather than Mound 12 sediment because the incubated ERB sediment contained more ANME-1 cells (incubation ERB1C) (Dekas et al., 2009) . NanoSIMS analysis revealed that single cells of ANME-1 did not fix nitrogen after a 6-month incubation with methane and 15 N 2 (n = 10; Figure 3g and Supplementary Figure 5A ). However, when we investigated the general anabolic activity of ANME-1 cells in parallel incubations with 15 NH 4 + and CH 4 , no 15 N uptake was observed, suggesting these archaea were not active in the microcosm incubation (n=5; Supplementary Figure 5B ). Conclusions regarding the ability of the ANME-1 to fix nitrogen therefore cannot be drawn. Consistent with previous studies (Nauhaus et al., 2005) , the lack of NH 4 + assimilation by ANME-1 in the same incubations where ANME-2 readily assimilated NH 4 + (Dekas et al., 2009) suggests differences in the ecological physiology and optimal growth conditions for members of the ANME-1 and ANME-2. Single sulfate-reducing bacteria are other likely candidates for N 2 fixation in methane seep sediment, given their diazotrophic activity in shallow marine sediments (Bertics et al., 2010 (Bertics et al., , 2012 . Indeed, the majority of the nifH transcripts recovered in this study fall within a phylogenetic clade that includes nifH sequences affiliated with deltaproteobacterial sulfate-reducing bacteria ( Figure 5 ). Single DSS and DSB cells were therefore targeted with FISH-NanoSIMS to determine whether or not they fix N 2 . However, after incubation with CH 4 and 15 N 2 , single DSS cells were not enriched in 15 N (n = 9; CR8). The lack of 15 N 2 incorporation observed for the single DSS does not eliminate the possibility of N 2 fixation, but it suggests that if occurring, it is rare. Interestingly, 33% of the single DSB cells analyzed did show 15 N enrichment (n = 21; CR8) ( Figures 2a  and 3d-f) . Additional DAPI-stained microorganisms from the same incubation showed no 15 N enrichment, indicating that recycling of 15 N-enriched substrates was not significant over the course of the 5-month incubation (n = 34; CR8) (Figures 2a and  3d) . Without additional information, the 15 N enrichment observed specifically in single DSB cells after incubation with 15 N 2 and methane would suggest diazotrophy. However, when FISH-NanoSIMS analyses were performed on single DSB cells in paired ",Anne Dekas,2016,26394007,10.1038/ismej.2015.145
35116371,"Cesiribacter andamanensis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from a soil sample from a mud volcano","A novel gram-staining-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile bacterium, strain AMV16(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected from a mud volcano located in the Andaman Islands, India. The cell suspension was pale orange. Cells of strain AMV16(T) were positive for catalase, oxidase, lipase, ornithine decarboxylase and lysine decarboxylase and negative for gelatinase and urease. The fatty acids present were anteiso-C(11 : 0) (5.4 %), anteiso-C(12 : 0) (4.1 %), C(12 : 0) (7.0 %), iso-C(15 : 0) (14.4 %), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (3.4 %), anteiso-C(16 : 0) (3.0 %), C(16 : 0) (2.6 %), anteiso-C(17 : 0) (3.7 %), iso-C(19 : 0) (9.7 %), C(13 : 1) (13.8 %), iso-C(15 : 1) G (15.9 %), iso-C(16 : 1) G (11.1 %) and summed feature 5 (anteiso-C(18 : 0) and/or C(18 : 2)ω6,9c; 5.9 %). Strain AMV16(T) contained MK-4 is [corrected] the major respiratory quinone and diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine made up the phospholipids. The G+C content of DNA of strain AMV16(T) was 50.9 mol%. blast sequence similarity searches based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that species of the genus Marivirga were the nearest phylogenetic neighbours, with pairwise sequence similarity ranging from 89.9 to 90.0 %. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain AMV16(T) clustered with the type strains of Marivirga tractuosa and Marivirga sericea at a phylogenetic distance of 14.6 % (85.4 % similarity), distinct from clades representing other genera of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae'. Based on the above-mentioned phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain AMV16(T) is proposed as a representative of a new genus and novel species, Cesiribacter andamanensis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Cesiribacter andamanensis is AMV16(T) ( = DSM 22818(T) = CCUG 58431(T)).","The systematics of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' are currently in a state of expansion, with many new genera being described within the last 6 years, including Fabibacter, Limibacter, Marinoscillum, Perexilibacter, Rapidithrix, Reichenbachiella, Marivirga and Roseivirga, from a wide variety of habitats such as decayed wood, sea shells (Srisukchayakul et al., 2007) , fresh water (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2010) , marine algae (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2005a; Srisukchayakul et al., 2007) , sediment (Yoon et al., 2007 (Yoon et al., , 2008 , sponges (Lau et al., 2006; Seo et al., 2009 ) and seawater (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2005b) . In the present study, we describe a novel bacterium isolated from a soil sample collected from a mud volcano that is assigned to a new genus that belongs to the family 'Flammeovirgaceae'. T was isolated from a soil sample collected from a mud volcano on Baratang Island, Middle Andamans, India, on 20 February 2009. The sample that yielded strain AMV16 T had a pH of 7.5. For isolation of bacteria, 100 mg soil sample was plated on ZoBell marine agar medium (ZoBell, 1941) and incubated at room temperature for 15 days. Based on colony morphology, a pale-orange colony was selected and characterized in the present study. Flexibacter tractuosa DSM 4126 T (now reclassified as Marivirga tractuosa, the type species of the genus Marivirga; Nedashkovskaya et al., 2010) was procured from the DSMZ; strain AMV16 T was characterized simultaneously with Marivirga (Flexibacter) tractuosa DSM 4126 T . Cell morphology and motility were studied using a light microscope. Motility was assessed on TSA containing (l 21 ) pancreatic digest of casein (17 g), papaic digest of soybean meal (3 g), NaCl (5 g), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (2.5 g), glucose (2.5 g) and agar (0.4 g) and on motility indole lysine agar slants (cat. no. SL033; HiMedia). Growth at 4, 10, 18, 30, 37 and 40 u C and salt tolerance [0 (without NaCl), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 % (w/v) NaCl], biochemical characteristics, carbon assimilation, H 2 S production and sensitivity of the culture to antibiotics were determined by previously described methods (Lányí, 1987; Smibert & Krieg, 1994) . Biochemical characteristics were confirmed with the Hi25 Enterobacteriaceae identification kit (cat. no. KB003) and HiCarbohydrate kit parts A, B and C (cat. no. KB009) (HiMedia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Growth of strain AMV16 T at pH 5, 6, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11 and 12 was assessed on TSA buffered with citric acid/NaOH (for pH 5 and 6), phosphate (pH 7 and 8), glycine/NaOH (for pH 9 and 10) or Tris (for pH 11 and 12). Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and analysed by using the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI) according to the protocol described by Agilent Technologies. For this purpose, strain AMV16 T and M. tractuosa DSM 4126 T were grown on marine agar 2216 (Difco) at 30 u C for 2 days. Polar lipids were extracted and analysed according to the method described by Komagata & Suzuki (1987) . Menaquinones and polar lipids were determined from freeze-dried cells. Menaquinones were extracted as described by Collins et al. (1977) and analysed by HPLC (Groth et al., 1997) . DNA was isolated according to the procedure of Marmur (1961) and the G+C content was determined from melting point (T m ) curves (Sly et al., 1986) obtained by using a Lambda 2 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) equipped with the Templab 2.0 software package (Perkin Elmer). Escherichia coli DNA was used as a standard in determining the DNA G+C content. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, DNA was prepared using the Mo Bio microbial DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.) and sequenced as described previously (Lane, 1991) . The resultant almost-complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene contained 1502 nt. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was subjected to BLAST sequence similarity search (Altschul et al., 1990) and EzTaxon (Chun et al., 2007) to identify the nearest taxa. All 16S rRNA gene sequences of members of the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' were downloaded from the NCBI database (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and aligned using the CLUSTAL_X program (Thompson et al., 1997) and the alignment was then corrected manually. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using two tree-making algorithms, the maximumlikelihood method using the PhyML program (Guindon & Gascuel, 2003) and the neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987) using the PHYLIP package, version 3.5 (Felsenstein, 1993) , and the resultant tree topologies were evaluated by bootstrap analysis based on 1000 resamplings using the SEQBOOT and CONSENSE programs in the PHYLIP package. Pairwise evolutionary distances were computed using the DNADIST program with Kimura's twoparameter model as developed by Kimura (1980) . T were Gram-negative, non-motile rods, 0.5-0.7 mm wide and 1-3 mm long (Fig. 1) , and multiplied by binary fission. Colonies were circular, 0.5-1.5 mm in diameter, smooth, shiny, pale orange, translucent and raised with entire margins on marine agar. The strain was positive for catalase, oxidase, ornithine decarboxylase, lysine decarboxylase and lipase and negative for DNase, gelatinase and urease. Strain AMV16 T reduced nitrate and hydrolysed aesculin but not starch, cellulose or casein. It was negative for indole production. Growth was observed at 18-37 u C with optimum growth at 30-37 u C, at 0-5 % (w/v) NaCl, with optimum growth at 2-3 %, and at pH 6-8, with optimum growth at pH 7.5. Other characteristics are presented in Table 1 . The cellular fatty acid composition of strain AMV16 T showed a spectrum of 12 fatty acids with a pronounced dominance (.4 %) of anteiso-C 11 : 0 , anteiso-C 12 : 0 , C 12 : 0 , iso-C 15 : 0 , iso-C 19 : 0 , C 13 : 1 , iso-C 15 : 1 G, iso-C 16 : 1 G and summed feature 5 (anteiso-C 18 : 0 and/or C 18 : 2 v6,9c) ( Table 2) . Saturated fatty acids constituted 62.3 % of the total fatty acids. When compared with M. tractuosa DSM 4126 T , the number of fatty acids detected in strain AMV16 T was greater and the composition differed considerably ( Table 2 ). The menaquinone present in AMV16 T was MK-4; diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine made up the phospholipids. Other characteristics are listed in the species description. The DNA G+C content of strain AMV16 T was 50.9 mol%. T were ascertained based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with other strains using the BLAST sequence similarity search (NCBI BLAST/EzTaxon). The results indicated that, at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level, strain AMV16 T was close to the phylogenetic neighbours M. tractuosa and M. sericea, with pairwise sequence similarity to the type strains of 89.9-90.0 %. Phylogenetic analyses based on maximumlikelihood and neighbour-joining trees further indicated that strain AMV16 T clustered with M. tractuosa and M. sericea at a phylogenetic distance of 14.6 %, distinct from clades representing the genera Fabibacter, Flammeovirga,  Flexithrix, Limibacter, Marinoscillum, Perexilibacter, Persicobacter, Rapidithrix, Reichenbachiella, Roseivirga and Thermonema (Fig. 2) . T differs from all the other genera in the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' by a number of characteristics (Table 3) . Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny, the nearest genus in the family 'Flammeovirgaceae' was T from the closely related M. tractuosa DSM 4126 T Data for both strains are from the present study. Both strains were rod-shaped, positive for oxidase and hydrolysis of aesculin and Tween 20, negative for hydrolysis of agar, casein, cellulose, DNA, starch and urea, phenylalanine deamination, H 2 S production, citrate utilization, Voges-Proskauer and methyl red tests and indole production and do not utilize glycine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, threonine, histidine, methionine, glutamine or serine. Both strains are resistant to (mg per disc) amikacin (30), cefazolin (30), co-trimoxazole (25), kanamycin (30), lomefloxacin (30), nalidixic acid (30), nitrofurantoin (300), penicillin G (10), streptomycin (10), tetracycline (30) and tobramycin (10) and sensitive to cefuroxime sodium salt (30), cefotaxime (30) and chloramphenicol (30).

Strain AMV16 T differed from the genus Marivirga with respect to characteristics such as major fatty acids and DNA G+C content (Table 3) . T could also be differentiated phenotypically from the closest related species M. tractuosa, the type species of the genus Marivirga (Table 3) . For instance, AMV16 T differed from M. tractuosa DSM 4126 T in colony colour, cell size, tolerance of salt, some enzyme activities, hydrolysis of gelatin and Tweens 40, 60 and 80, acid production from carbohydrates, utilization of various carbon sources, antibiotic susceptibility, major fatty acids, phospholipids and DNA G+C content (Table 1) . Thus, the cumulative differences that strain AMV16 T exhibits from the species of Marivirga unambiguously support the creation of a new genus and species to accommodate strain AMV16 T , for which the name Cesiribacter andamanensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. Phylogenetic analysis of taxa related to the genus Flexibacter of the family Cytophagaceae indicated that the genus Flexibacter is polyphyletic and its species cluster randomly with different genera (Fig. 2) (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2010) . Thus, it is evident the genus Flexibacter remains polyphyletic and there is a continuing need to re-evaluate its taxonomic status based on polyphasic taxonomy and comparison with all taxa within the family Cytophagaceae.

26654892,"Belliella pelovolcani sp. nov., isolated from a mud-volcano in Taiwan.","Strain CC-SAL-25T, a non-motile, Gram-negative, red-pigmented bacterium, was isolated from a rare mud-volcano, located in Wandan, Pingtung County, Taiwan. Studies based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strain clustered closely with Belliella baltica BA143T (95.4 % sequence similarity). A menaquinone with seven isoprene units (MK-7) was the major respiratory quinone. The fatty acid profile was slightly different from that of B. baltica BA143T. The results of the physiological and biochemical tests showed that strain CC-SAL-25T could be clearly differentiated from recognized Belliella species based on phenotypic properties. It was evident from the genotypic and phenotypic data that strain CC-SAL-25T should be classified as representing a second novel species in the genus Belliella. The name proposed for this taxon is Belliella pelovolcani sp. nov., and the type strain is CC-SAL-25T (=BCRC 17883T=KCTC 13248T).","During investigations on the biodiversity of bacteria associated with a rare mud-volcano (mud basin) located in Liyushan (Mt. Carp), Wandan Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan [22u 569 N 120 u 469 E; temperature, 38 u C; pH 8.2; alkalinity, 3.3 mM; Cl 13 mM; SO 4 1020 mM; Na 10 mM (You et al., 2004) ], strain CC- T was isolated and maintained on marine agar 2216 (MA; Difco) after incubation at 37 u C for 48 h. Subcultivation was done on MA at 37 u C for 2-3 days. On this medium, strain CC- T was able to grow at 25-40 u C, but not at 45 or 20 uC. The organism was able to grow on nutrient agar (NA; HI-MEDIA), R2A agar (Difco) and MacConkey agar (bioMérieux). Strain CC- T was preserved at 280 u C in nutrient broth [marine broth (MB); Difco] with 20 % (v/v) glycerol or by lyophilization. Gram-staining was performed as described by Gerhardt et al. (1994) . The presence of poly-b-hydroxybutyrate granule accumulation was assessed using light microscopy (Zeiss model A3000; 61000; Taiwan Instrument Co.) after the cells were stained with Sudan black. Phenotypic characteristics, biochemical tests, carbon source utilization (Biolog-GN), API ZYM enzyme profiles (bioMérieux), API 20E (bioMérieux), API 20NE (bioMérieux), API 50 CH (bioMérieux) and ATB-PSE (bioMérieux) were investigated. For the guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) content calculations, a DNA sample was prepared and degraded enzymically into nucleosides as described by Mesbah et al. (1989) . The nucleoside mixture obtained was then separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The G+C content of the DNA of strain CC-SAL-25 T was 40±1 mol% (mean±SD). Cell morphology was observed by using light microscopy (Zeiss model A3000; 61000), with cells that had been grown for 48 h at 37 uC on MA. The results are given in the species description. The pH range for growth was determined by measuring the optical density (wavelength, 595 nm) of a culture grown in MB that was adjusted prior to sterilization to various pH values (pH 3211, at intervals of 0.5 pH units) using appropriate biological buffers (Chung et al., 1995) . Verification of the pH values after autoclaving revealed only minor changes. Growth at various temperatures (10-55 uC) was measured in MB. Anaerobic growth was checked by using the Oxoid AnaeroGen system (Miller et al., 1995) in MB. Growth was recorded by measuring the optical density (OD 595 ) of the culture with respect to time. Cellular pigments were extracted with acetone/methanol (7 : 2, v/v), from cultures grown on MA and the absorption spectra were determined with a scanning UV/visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi; Japan). The presence of flexirubin-type pigments was investigated as described by Reichenbach (1992) and Bernardet et al. (2002) . The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CC-SAL-25 T was determined and analysed as described previously (Young et al., 2005) . Analysis of the sequence data was performed by using the software package MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) version 2.1 (Kumar et al., 2001) , after multiple alignments of data using CLUSTAL_X (Thompson et al., 1997) . A distance matrix method (distance options according to the Kimura two-parameter model), including clustering by neighbour-joining (Fig. 1) , and a discretecharacter-based maximum-parsimony method were used. In each case bootstrap values were calculated based on 1000 replications. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CC-SAL-25 T obtained was a continuous stretch of 1444 bp. Sequence similarity calculations indicated that strain CC-SAL-25 T showed greatest similarity to the species Belliella baltica (95.4 %; GenBank accession no. AJ564643), which to-date is the only recognized species in the genus Belliella (Brettar et al., 2004) in the Cytophaga-FlavobacteriumBacteroides group, whereas lower sequence similarities (,94.5 %) were found with all other species shown in Fig. 1 . Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared, separated and identified according to the instructions of the Microbial Identification System (MIDI; Microbial ID). The fatty acid profile of strain CC-SAL-25 T was consistent with that reported for B. baltica BA134 T (Brettar et al., 2004) , but the amounts of the fatty acids iso-C 15 : 1 G, iso-C 15 : 0 and C 15 : 1 v6c differed (Table 1) . Respiratory quinones of strain CC-SAL-25 T were extracted, separated and identified as described by Minnikin et al. (1984) and analysed by HPLC as described by Collins & Jones (1980) . A menaquinone with seven isoprene units (MK-7) was the predominant respiratory quinone. DNA-DNA relatedness experiments were not carried out between strain CC-SAL-25 T and its closest phylogenetic neighbour B. baltica BA134 T as the level of 16S rRNA gene Fig. 1 . Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences available from the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases (accession numbers are given in parentheses) constructed after multiple alignments of data by using CLUSTAL_X (Thompson et al., 1997) . Distances (distance options according to the Kimura-2 model) and clustering with the neighbour-joining method were performed by using the software package MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) version 2.1 (Kumar et al., 2001) . Percentage bootstrap values based on 1000 replications are given at branch points. Bar, 0.02 nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide position. sequence similarity between the strains was less than 96 %, which is below the cutoff value (97 %) suggested by Stackebrandt & Goebel (1994) for genomic distinction of species. The results of the physiological characterization are given in the species description and in Table 2 . Strain CC-SAL-25 T was capable of producing acid from various carbohydrates, but carbon substrate oxidation tests with organic acids as substrates showed few positive results. T could be differentiated from B. baltica BA134 T , according to both phenotype (differential biochemical tests are given in Table 2 ) and genotype, and represents a second member of the genus Belliella, for which we propose the name Belliella pelovolcani sp. nov.

The genus Methanoculleus currently comprises 11 characterized and valid species: (10) , M. taiwanensis CYW4 T (11), and M. sediminis S3Fa T (1) . The sources of these Methanoculleus spp. are truly diverse, including marine sediments, wastewater plants, wetlands, oil fields, and paddy fields. Here, we provide the draft genome sequence of M. sediminis S3Fa T as a basis for future comparative studies and understanding the ecological roles of this genus. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2 ϫ 300-bp reads. The reads were quality-filtered, trimmed, and assembled into contigs using the de novo assembler CLC Genomic Workbench version 7.5. The draft genome comprises 15 contigs with total length of~2.49-Mb and a GϩC content of 62.3%. Gene annotations were performed by using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP); 2,459 predicted genes, 3 rRNAs, 48 tRNAs, and 1 ncRNA were obtained. The genome contains the genes of formate dehydrogenase, which is essential for formate utilization for methane production and growth of Methanoculleus sediminis S3Fa T . Three clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated cas genes were identified. Furthermore, this genome contains three coding genes for trehalose synthases, which convert ADP-glucose to trehalose. This genome also comprises complete gene sets of heat shock proteins, including DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL, GroES, prefoldin subunits, and small heat shock proteins. The genetic and physiological characteristics of strain S3Fa T will be unveiled by comparative genomic analyses with Methanoculleus spp. and methanogens within other taxa.

3261826,Multiple visions of Indonesia's mud volcano: understanding representations of disaster across discursive settings,"The Lapindo mudflow is one of the most controversial disasters in Indonesian history. Despite its unique biophysical features, most consider the mudflow a social disaster as scientific conflicts about its main trigger have evolved into legal disputes over accountability and rights. This paper examines this 'trigger debate', the stakes of scientific contention and the broader social and natural dynamics that shape the terms of this debate. A Latourian impulse drives this analysis, which aims to improve both understandings of--and responses to--complex disasters. This paper also notes that the stakes of representation extend to constructions of its stakeholders, especially to victims. As socionatural disasters become an increasingly common feature of the contemporary world, from mud volcanoes to extreme weather events caused by global warming, it is more important than ever to understand the dynamics of representing disasters and stakeholders.",N/A,Phillip Drake,2016,26282449,10.1111/disa.12145
49214293,Deep-biosphere methane production stimulated by geofluids in the Nankai accretionary complex,"Microbial life inhabiting subseafloor sediments plays an important role in Earth’s carbon cycle. However, the impact of geodynamic processes on the distributions and carbon-cycling activities of subseafloor life remains poorly constrained. We explore a submarine mud volcano of the Nankai accretionary complex by drilling down to 200 m below the summit. Stable isotopic compositions of water and carbon compounds, including clumped methane isotopologues, suggest that ~90% of methane is microbially produced at 16° to 30°C and 300 to 900 m below seafloor, corresponding to the basin bottom, where fluids in the accretionary prism are supplied via megasplay faults. Radiotracer experiments showed that relatively small microbial populations in deep mud volcano sediments (10^2 to 10^3 cells cm^(−3)) include highly active hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetogens. Our findings indicate that subduction-associated fluid migration has stimulated microbial activity in the mud reservoir and that mud volcanoes may contribute more substantially to the methane budget than previously estimated.","One of the missions of scientific ocean drilling is to enhance the understanding of the impact of geodynamic processes-such as the subduction of oceanic plates into the Earth's mantle-on the deep subseafloor biosphere. Previous studies on the deep biosphere have demonstrated that microbes in ocean sediments generally experience long-term energy limitation (1, 2) . Throughout millions of years of burial, the increasing pressure and temperatures create an ever more challenging environment for sustaining life, unless bioavailable water and energy substrates are supplied from exogenous biotic and/or abiotic sources (3) . Submarine mud volcanoes occurring along the margins of con-vergent plates are surface expressions of natural conduits that transport low-density, deformable sediments from several kilometers below the seafloor up toward the seafloor. These migration pathways may supply subsurface-derived water, gaseous compounds such as methane (CH 4 ), and even microbes to the overlying hydrosphere and atmosphere (4) (5) (6) (7) . In particular, methane emission from mud volcanoes is a significant (up to~10%) source of fossil (radiocarbon-free) methane to the atmosphere (6) . Previous geological and geochemical studies at multiple geographic locations suggest that most CH 4 erupting from submarine mud volcanoes originates either from destabilization of gas hydrates immediately beneath the relatively shallow sedimentary layers or from migration of fluids from deeper hydrocarbon accumulations (4, 5) . Because of the high-pressure and low-temperature conditions in submarine mud volcano sediments, a large fraction of this migrated CH 4 is sequestrated in shallow mud volcano sediments as gas hydrates (5) . Gas hydrate stability primarily depends on temperature and pressure (water depth). With normal sea-bottom temperatures of 2°to 4°C, gas hydrate can exist if water depths exceed 250 to 400 m (ca. >25 to 40 atm) (8) . Recent studies have shown that variations in dissolved organic matter and CH 4 input from deep sediment layers, as well as variations in rates of fluid advection, control microbial community composition and metabolism in surface sediments at mud volcano sites (9) (10) (11) . For example, at the Haakon Mosby mud volcano in the Norwegian Sea, microbial communities performing anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) consume up to~40% of upward transported CH 4 (9) . At the Amsterdam mud volcano in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, acetoclastic methanogenesis was observed in~60-cm-deep sediments, likely supported by high concentrations of acetate (up to 1878 mM) produced in deeper layers there (10) . Similarly, rate measurements and genetic data from an active brine seep mud volcano in the northern Gulf of Mexico revealed a predominance of acetoclastic over hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (11) . Still remaining to be explored, however, were the composition and metabolism of microbial communities at greater depths in mud volcano sediments than could be sampled by traditional near-surface coring surveys. Carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of CH 4 , considered together with molar ratios of CH 4 to higher hydrocarbons (C 1 /C 2+ ), can help identify CH 4 production pathways (12) (13) (14) . A previous assess-ment of these chemical signals in more than 200 onshore mud volcanoes estimated that 76% of CH 4 released is thermogenic, 4% is microbial, and 20% is a mixture of methane from both origins (15) . Mud volcanoes emitting thermogenic CH 4 are generally associated with strongly tectonized petroliferous sedimentary basins. In contrast, the factors controlling the presence, distribution, and quantity of microbially generated CH 4 in mud volcano fluids are less understood. The sources of CH 4 at offshore subduction zones remain largely elusive, mainly because of the lack of opportunities to directly sample deep subseafloor materials and characterize their microbiology and biogeochemistry in situ. In 2009 and 2012, using the drillship Chikyu, we established Site C9004 by drilling into mud volcano no. 5 (KMV#5) in the Kumano forearc basin of the Nankai Trough, Japan (Fig. 1A) . While a submarine mud volcano has been drilled once before, during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 160 in the Mediterranean Sea (16) , the deep biosphere and carbon cycling of such environments remain underexplored. In the Kumano Basin, 13 mud volcanoes have been observed at anticlines along the landward megasplay faults (Fig. 1, B and C) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Chemosynthetic macrofaunal communities occur at seep environments on the summits of these features (19) . Previous investigations of surface sediments of mud volcanoes in the area inferred that the erupting fluids consist of water derived from dehydration of clay minerals in subducted sediments and basaltic crust, mixed with thermogenic hydrocarbons originating from the old accretionary prism beneath the forearc basin (19, 20) . KMV#5 is one of the active mud volcanoes in the area (17, 19) . A release of CH 4 was observed here in response to a large earthquake in 2004 [moment magnitude (M w ) 7.5] (21) . Furthermore, biogenic CH 4 production has been implicated as an (17) . (C) P-wave velocity predicted by three-dimensional (3D) tomography inversion during 3D prestack depth migration based on the data from Tsuji et al. (18) . The overpressure zone (fluid or gas accumulation zone) is identified as a low-amplitude and low-velocity zone at 400 to 700 mbsf in the forearc basin sequence. The low-velocity zone, which is located above the ridge because of the megasplay fault displacement, suggests that the overpressured fluids are moving upward along the interpreted ancient megasplay faults. The mud volcanoes are located along the northern extension of the megasplay faults. additional hydrocarbon source at this site (19, 21) . KMV#5 was therefore a prime location at which to investigate the relationship between methanogenesis and mud volcanism. We recovered sediment core samples from Site C9004 down to 200 m below seafloor (mbsf) using a hydraulic piston coring system (HPCS) and a gas-tight hybrid-pressure coring system (Hybrid-PCS) (22) . We show here how geological, geochemical, and microbiological analyses on the core material yield constraints on the origins of water and CH 4 in the migrating muds, and provide insights into the presence and activity of microbial life within the Nankai accretionary complex.  Sediment samples were composed primarily of clay-rich mud, including consolidated to semiconsolidated breccias, which were most likely mixed with fractured sediments by diapiric mud intrusion. After core recovery, small grains of methane hydrates (millimeters to centimeters in diameter) were often observed and collected on the core-cutting area (fig. S1, A and B). X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans of Hybrid-PCS cores also showed that methane hydrates filled pore spaces and veins of sediments (22) . The in situ temperature was measured during HPCS coring using the third-generation advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) at 4, 22, 59, and 121 mbsf, yielding an estimated temperature gradient of 29 ± 0.3°C km −1 ( fig. S2 ). Linear extrapolation of this geothermal gradient places the lower depth limit of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) [that is, the deepest horizon where pressures and temperatures remain suitable for hydrate formation and stability (19) ] at an estimated~590 m below the summit. The sum-mit of KMV#5 is elevated 112 to 160 m above the regional seafloor, so the base of the GHSZ corresponds to 430 to 478 m below the regional seafloor. This is comparable to the depth of the bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) observed in seismic profiles of the sedimentary basin surrounding KMV#5 (411 to 463 mbsf; figs. S1D and S2). Geochemical analyses of pore water samples show that chlorinity (Cl − ) decreased sharply from seawater-like values (545 mM) at 0 mbsf to 130 to 150 mM at 4 mbsf and then remained constant downcore ( Fig. 2A) . Concurrent with the Cl − depletion, the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of water (d 18 O H2O and dD H2O ) shift toward high (ca. 6‰) and low (ca. −13‰) values relative to seawater (ca. 0‰), respectively ( fig. S3, A and B ). This trend can be attributed to the addition of water from the dehydration of clay minerals (16, 20) that typically occurs in deeper layers at temperatures ranging from 60°to 160°C (23). Conversely, dD H2O and d 18 O H2O values of water obtained from methane hydrate melts were higher than those of pore water (Fig. 2, B consistent with small hydrate grains homogeneously precipitated in muddy sediments throughout the GHSZ ( fig. S4 and Supplementary Methods). Relatively constant values of Cl − , d 18 O H2O , and dD H2O be-low~5 mbsf indicate that the pore fluids below~5 mbsf consist mainly of the original water from dehydration of clay minerals and that the effect of seawater diffusing from the overlying water column is negligible. Hydrocarbon gases, dissolved inorganic carbon, and sulfate The SO 4 2− concentrations decrease from~20 mM near the seafloor to less than 1 mM around 4 mbsf ( Fig. 3C and table S1). The measured CH 4 concentrations in headspace gas were <1 mM in shallow sediments above 2 mbsf. In the sediments below, CH 4 content ranged from 2 to 26 mM ( Fig. 3A and table S1). The ratio of methane to ethane concentration (C 1 /C 2 ) in the headspace gas increased from~120 near sediment surface to~500 at 2 mbsf. Below that depth, the C 1 /C 2 ratio ranged from 249 to 1593 ( Fig. 4A and table S1). The concentration ratio of ethane to propane (C 2 /C 3 ) was 2 to 12 (table S1). The carbon isotopic compositions of CH 4 (d 13 C CH4 ) increased from~−20‰ near sediment surface to~−35‰ at 2 mbsf. In the sediments below, d 13 C CH4 values were constant at −34.3 ± 2.3‰. The hydrogen isotopic compositions (dD CH4 ) were also constant at −186 ± 15‰ (Figs. 3B and 4C). Analyses of the methane isotopologues 12 CH 4 , 13 CH 4 , 12 CH 3 D, and 13 CH 3 D (24, 25) in two Hybrid-PCS samples obtained from 6.5 and 61.5 mbsf returned ""clumped"" isotopologue (D 13 CH 3 D) temperatures of 29 þ10 À9°C and 31 þ12 À11°C (95% confidence interval), respectively (Figs. 3B and 4D and table S2). The concentration of DIC increased from 6 mM near the seafloor to ca. 35 mM at~4 mbsf and scattered around 30 to 40 mM below the depth ( Fig. 3C and table S1). The d 13 C value of DIC (d 13 C DIC ) increased steeply from −20‰ near the seafloor to +40‰ at~2 mbsf and decreased slightly to +35‰ from 15 to 125 mbsf (Figs. 3D and 4B and table S1). The high d 13 C DIC values at depth are most likely related to isotopic fractionation during microbial CO 2 reduction (26) . Relative constancy of the DIC concentration with depth suggests either that CO 2 reduction occurred below the cored depths or that there may be an additional source of CO 2 (perhaps thermogenic) to the migrating fluids (27) . Hybrid-PCS samples obtained from 6.5 and 61.5 mbsf were used for the analysis of in situ gas concentrations on the Chikyu (table S3 ) (22) . The CH 4 content in the Hybrid-PCS cores ranged from 1.6 to 11.0 m 3 -CH 4 ·m −3 (as CH 4 amount per sediment volume at the standard temperature and pressure), corresponding to concentrations of 246 to 1705 mM, respectively (806 mM on average; Fig. 3A ). Because these concentrations far exceed solubility (<54 mM at 120 mbsf), most CH 4 should be present in hydrate form in situ. Given these data, methane hydrate saturation in pore space was calculated to be 2.8 to 22.6% (10.4% on average).  Headspace CH 4 concentration, 13  The concentrations of acetate in the pore water were high in the top 4 m (up to 90 mM at 0.6 mbsf) relative to those deeper than 4 mbsf and decreased to 10 to 20 mM at 20 mbsf. Below 20 mbsf, the concentrations remained at approximately 20 mM ( Fig. 3C and table S1). The vertical acetate concentration profile suggests that it is produced largely at shallow depths in situ. The relatively constant acetate concentrations below 20 mbsf suggest either well-balanced production and consumption or little biological cycling of acetate at depths below 20 mbsf. The d 13 C values of acetate (d 13 C acetate ) increase from −41‰ on the seafloor to −22‰ at 4 mbsf, showing a trend similar to the d 13 C DIC profile ( Fig. 3D ). Below 4 mbsf, the d 13 C acetate values (−26‰ to −13‰), which are high compared to the d 13 C values of TOC (d 13 C TOC , −24.4 ± 0.5‰), suggest the occurrence of fermentative production in the presence of low rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis. This is because the d 13 C of acetate derived from fermentation is close to that of TOC, and acetoclastic methanogenesis involves preferential consumption of 12 C-acetate, which will enrich 13 C in the residual acetate pool (28) . Furthermore, Black solid line represents the most plausible two-end-member mixing scenario between biogenic and thermogenic hydrocarbons, and the black dashed curves show the possible range based on varying assumptions. Blue dashed curve shows the scenario between the biogenic hydrocarbon with normal d 13 C CH4 (−65‰) and thermogenic hydrocarbons.

(C) Relationships between d 13 C CH4 and dD CH4 with respect to gas source (14) . In (A) to (C), the data from the other mud volcanoes in the Kumano Basin (19) , Nankai Trough area (see Supplementary Methods), and Cascadia margin (27) are plotted.

Solid green curve represents isotopic equilibrium, with e methane/water calibration [e methane/water = (D/H) methane /(D/H) water − 1] given by Horibe and Craig (60) . Green shading represents ranges of e methane/water calibrations from other published studies (47) . the large isotopic difference between DIC and acetate (ca. 58.8 ± 7‰) indicates acetogenic CO 2 reduction via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway as a second possible source of acetate (28) . Thermal decomposition of organic matter is the third possible source of acetate. For example, d 13 C values of acetic acid in oilfield waters of the San Joaquin Basin in California range from +0.6 to −19.3‰ and are generally higher than those of coproduced oils (29) . The deviation between the d 13 C values of acetic acid and oil was reported to be larger than 5‰. The d 13 C acetate values higher than d 13 C TOC values below 4 mbsf could be attributed to a deep source of acetate. Hydrogen H 2 concentrations measured onboard were scattered, ranging from 176 to 7760 nM ( Fig. 3E and table S1). The gas concentrations of H 2 and hydrocarbon gases in the headspace gas that we report should be taken as minimum estimates because of degassing during core recovery and sampling. Despite degassing, the measured H 2 concentrations are more than two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of H 2 in pore waters of stratified continental margin sediments (30) . A Hybrid-PCS sample at 61.5 mbsf yielded an estimated in situ H 2 concentration of 28.1 mM (Fig. 3E and table S3) , which is more than three orders of magnitude higher than in typical continental margin sediments (30) but slightly lower than the 1 to 500 mM (49 mM on average) observed in 1500-to 2500-mbsf sediments at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site C0020 off the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan (3). The fluorescence image-based analysis of SYBR Green I-stained cells (31) shows that relatively small microbial populations are present throughout the conduit of the intruded mud ( Fig. 5A ). Cell numbers decrease from 10 5 cells cm −3 at 2.6 mbsf to 10 2 cells cm −3 at 5.2 mbsf and then slightly increase again. Below 15 mbsf, cell numbers range from 10 1 to 10 3 cells cm −3 ( Fig. 5A and table S4 ). In general, cell abundances in deeper mud volcano sediments are at least three orders of magnitude lower than those observed at similar depths in the surrounding Kumano sedimentary basin ( Fig. 5A ) and at other locations on continental margins (32) . Instead, the cell abundances of deep mud volcano sediments are similar to those observed in the submarine mud volcanoes in the Ryukyu Trench off Tanegashima Island, southern Japan (7) , deep sediments associated with lignite coalbeds at~1.9 to 2.5 km below seafloor (kmbsf) at IODP Site C0020 (3), or the most oligotrophic open ocean sediments of the South Pacific Gyre (1). Among the total (bacterial and archaeal) 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequence reads from all sediment core samples (436,687 reads), almost all 16S sequences detected from deep mud volcano sediments were derived from psychrophilic to mesophilic microbes. The diversity index (Chao-1) of 16S sequence reads showed that the richness of bacterial communities was generally higher than that of archaeal communities, decreased with increasing depth in shallow sediments down to 5.2 mbsf, and was relatively constant in deeper sediments (table S5) . Cluster and community network analyses based on the b-diversity also showed that both bacterial and archaeal communities in deeper sediments differed compositionally from those inhabiting shallow sediments above 5.2 mbsf (figs. S5 and S6). In shallow sediments above 5.2 mbsf, 16S sequences related to Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria (Desulfobacterales-relatives), and the ANME-1 group were detected predominantly, suggestive of the occurrence of AOM consortia (Fig. 5 , B and C). Similarly, numbers of 16S sequences for Acidobacteria, Thaumarchaeota (Nitrosopumilusrelatives), and Marine Benthic Group-B [alternatively, Deep-Sea Archaeal Group (DSAG) or ""Lokiarchaeota""] decreased with increasing depth. These trends suggest that bacterial and archaeal communities in shallow sediments rely on substrates supplied from the downward diffusing seawater (33) . In deeper sediments, bacterial 16S sequences within Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonadales, Rhizobiales), Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales), Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderiales), Chloroflexi, ""Atribacteria"" (JS1 group), Actinobacteria (OPB41 group), and Firmicutes (Bacillales, Clostridiales) were predominantly detected ( Fig. 5B ). Archaeal 16S sequences were mostly classified to ""Bathyarchaeota"" (34, 35) , previously designated as the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG; Fig. 5C ). Archaeal 16S related to Methanosarcinales dominated sediments at 19.3 mbsf (15,892 reads), where only four and one sequence reads were related to Bathyarchaeota and South African Gold Mine Euryarchaeota Group (SAGMEG), respectively. At 104 mbsf, we detected sequences of the Soil Crenarchaeota Group (SCG), ANME-1, and Methanosarcinales-relatives, comprising 26.9, 71.5, and 1.5% in the total 16S read number (20,714 reads), respectively ( Fig. 5C ). Potential rates of methanogenesis and acetogenesis 14 C-radiotracer incubation analyses showed that the potential activities of homoacetogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and acetoclastic methanogenesis were 14 to 34,900, 0.6 to 128, and 0.004 to 0.10 pmol cm −3 day −1 , respectively ( Fig. 5D and table S6 ). These data indicate that both acetogenesis and methanogenesis via CO 2 reduction occur in deep mud volcano sediments, their activities being a few orders of magnitude higher than that of acetoclastic methanogenesis. The potential activities of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are comparable to those measured in the marine sediments at the northern Cascadia margin (36) . The activities of methanogenesis and acetogenesis in the shallowest sample are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those below 5 mbsf. The activity of acetogenesis at 13 mbsf is four orders of magnitude higher than that in the shallowest sample. This is consistent with the low activity of methanogenesis and acetogenesis in the sulfate reduction zone in which sulfate reducers outcompete methanogens and acetogens for H 2 (2, 30) . Co-occurring homoacetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are thermodynamically feasible given Gibbs free energy yields under in situ conditions of −84.1 ± 2.7 kJ mol −1 and −86.0 ± 1.4 kJ mol −1 , respectively ( Fig. 5E ). Even if the energy yields were calculated by using the (lower) headspace H 2 concentrations (ranging from 176 to 7760 nM), the resultant Gibbs free energies of −56.1 ± 9.0 kJ mol −1 for homoacetogenesis and −61.4 ± 9.2 kJ mol −1 for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis still indicate that the co-occurrence of both metabolic reactions is feasible. We measured hydrogenase activity in deep mud volcano sediments by incubation with 3 H 2 , ranging from 0.03 to 2.27 mmol H 2 cm −3 day −1 [mean = 0.70 ± 0.75 mmol H 2 cm −3 day −1 (n = 6); Fig. 5D and table  S6 ]. Such activities are comparable to those previously observed in sediments at the Equatorial Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico continental slope (37) . The relatively high values were observed in shallow sediment samples around the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ; see Discussion). The cell-specific hydrogenase activity estimated by dividing the activity value by the respective cell concentration ranged from 1.7 × 10 −2 to 61 nmol H 2 cell −1 day −1 (table S6) . Reflecting the low cell abundance in deep mud volcano sediments, microbial intact polar lipids (IPLs) were only found in relatively low concentrations (<100 ng g −1 of sediment dry weight in most samples; table  S7 ). The IPL contents in deeper mud volcano sediments are at least two orders of magnitude lower than those observed in normal subseafloor sediments at the same depth range (38) . Bacterial IPLs were barely detected, and most of the archaeal IPLs were composed of monoglycosidic glycerol-dibiphytanyl-glycerol-tetraethers (GDGTs), possibly because of their high preservation potential (39) . Archaeal core lipids representing fossil biomass were generally more abundant than IPLs (39) and consisted of both diethers [or archaeol (AR)] and tetraethers (or GDGTs). Both AR and hydroxylated AR (OH-AR) were detected as major archaeal diether lipids. H-shaped GDGTs (H-GDGTs) were detected in all samples and were also observed with additional mono-, di-, and trimethylation in the isoprenoidal chain (40) . The H-GDGTs are characteristic membrane lipids of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea, including members of the methanogens, Thermococcales and Thermoplasmatales. H-GDGTs are most likely derived from the relict biomolecules of thermophilic communities (see Supplementary Text). Intact ARs were only found in the deepest sample examined (120 mbsf ) and composed of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), monoglycosyl (G), and diglycosyl (2G) headgroups, including a PG-OH-AR. The latter IPL is a signature lipid of the Methanosarcinales (41), and correspondingly, PG-OH-AR is a major archaeal IPL in cold seeps dominated by Methanosarcinales-related ANME-2 (42) . The detection of PG-OH-AR and other phosphoglycosylated and glycosylated ARs coincided with the highest concentration of core OH-AR and AR, suggesting the presence of an active methanogenic population in deeply buried mud volcano sediments. mazei ( fig. S7E and Supplementary Text). The isolate can grow on H 2 /CO 2 , acetate, methanol, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine; however, formate, dimethylsulfide, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, cyclopentanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol did not support cell growth. The optimum growth temperature of strain 1H1 was at 40°C in the possible range of 2°to 50°C ( fig. S7C ). While the isolate can grow under the wide range of NaCl concentrations, it preferentially grows under very low salinity conditions ( fig. S7D ).  On the basis of the vertical profiles of CH 4 and SO 4 2− , we locate the SMTZ, where most of the methane is consumed by microbial AOM coupled to microbial sulfate reduction, between 1 and 3 mbsf. Other geochemical signals are consistent with an SMTZ at this depth. The shift in d 13 C value of CH 4 (d 13 C CH4 ) from −35‰ at 2 mbsf to −20‰ at the seafloor (Fig. 3B) is consistent with preferential consumption of 12 C-methane during microbial AOM (14) . A concomitant drop in the ratio of methane to ethane concentration (C 1 /C 2 ) in the headspace gas from~500 at 2 mbsf to 119 at the seafloor (table S1) is also consistent with the consumption of CH 4 within the upwelling muds at a depth near 2 mbsf. The decrease of CH 4 concentration in conjunction with the increase of d 13 C CH4 values from the SMTZ to seafloor, and the constant d 13 C CH4 value below the SMTZ, indicates that CH 4 was derived from larger depths and consumed by AOM near sediment surface. The consumption of CH 4 by AOM is indicated by the low C 1 /C 2 ratios and high d 13 C CH4 values, with low d 13 C DIC values of the data shallower than the SMTZ (Fig. 4, A and B) . The average d 13 C (−34.3 ± 2.3‰) values of methane below the SMTZ are within the typical range of thermogenic methane (Fig. 4A ) (12, 14) . However, relatively high C 1 /C 2 ratios (249 to 1593) in the headspace gas below the SMTZ compared to the ordinary C 1 /C 2 ratios of thermogenic gas imply either a predominance of biologically produced CH 4 or preferential consumption of thermogenic C 2+ hydrocarbons ( Fig. 4A) (19) . The C 1 /C 2 ratios, which are slightly lower than the typical C 1 /C 2 ratios (>1000) of biogenic CH 4 , and the d 13 C values of ethane ranging from −32 to −26‰ indicate a minor contribution of thermogenic hydrocarbons. The C 2 /C 3 ratios are greater than~1 (table S1), suggesting that C 2+ hydrocarbons are predominantly derived from a thermogenic source in which ethane is generally enriched to propane (43) . Thermogenic gas here was probably generated from sedimentary organic matter below 2 kmbsf, where estimated in situ temperatures exceed 80°C (44) , and transported with the ascending fluids and muds (see Supplementary  Text) . When the previously reported data in the Nankai Trough area ( fig. S8 and Supplementary Text) and the northern Cascadia margin (27) are plotted, the C 1 /C 2 ratio and the d 13 C CH4 at KMV#5 and other mud volcanoes in the Kumano Basin (19) deviate from all possible mixing curves of ordinary biogenic methane with normal d 13 C CH4 (~−65‰) and C 1 /C 2 (>1000) and thermogenic gas (d 13 C CH4 ,~−40‰; C 1 /C 2 , 8) (Fig. 4A) . The trend is rather consistent with a biogenic methane end-member that carries a relatively high d 13 C value (~−35‰). Such elevated d 13 C values and high C 1 /C 2 (>100) are unusual for biogenic gases and, under some isotope-based classification schemes [for example, the study of Whiticar (14) ], would be typed as thermogenic methane generated from high-maturity organic-rich shales (45) . However, such highly mature shales probably do not occur in the Nankai Trough subduction zone (17, 18) . The accretionary prism here is dominated by younger hemipelagic sediments that are quite different from, for example, the old [>100 million years (Ma)] and thick shales found in North America (45) on which the aforementioned interpretive schemes were partially based. As we discuss below, KMV#5 is not the first site where biogenic CH 4 containing isotopically heavy ( 13 C-enriched) carbon has been observed in marine sediments. The isotope separation between d 13 C CH4 and d 13 C DIC , expressed as the isotope separation factor e c (e c ≈ d 13 C DIC − d 13 C CH4 ) (14) , was 73.9 ± 3.5‰ below the SMTZ (Fig. 4B) . We interpret the large e c to indicate hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Fig. 4B) (14) . The lighter 12 C in DIC is preferentially consumed by microorganisms during hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, leaving the residual DIC pool enriched in 13 C (a process sometimes termed ""substrate depletion"") (14, 26) . As more DIC converts to CH 4 , both the accumulated methane and the remaining DIC pools become increasingly 13 C-enriched, with CH 4 here approaching values of ca. −34‰. Such enrichment of 13 C has been observed in other areas in which biological methanogenesis is the dominant source of CH 4 , including hydrate-bearing sediment at IODP Site U1329 in the northern Cascadia margin (d 13 C CH4 , up to −39.5‰; d 13 C CO2 , up to +25.7‰; C 1 /C 2 ,~10 3 to 10 5 ) (Fig. 4, A and B) (27) and Tertiary hemipelagic sediments in the Middle America Trench off Guatemala (d 13 C CH4 , up to −39.0‰; d 13 C CO2 , up to +27.6‰; C 1 /C 2 ,~10 2 to 10 5 ) (46) . The dD CH4 values of the methane in KMV#5 are very constant at ca. −185‰. The difference between dD CH4 (−186 ± 15‰) and dD of the original pore water (−9.2 to −16.2‰) before methane hydrate precipitation is consistent with observed ranges of dD values for biogenic methane in marine sediments [dD CH4 = dD H2O − 160‰ (or 180‰)] (13, 14) . In contrast, thermogenic gases produced from a highly mature marine or humic source rock will typically be >−150‰ (13) . On the basis of these relationships between d 13 C CH4 , d 13 C CH4 , d 13 C DIC , and C 1 /C 2 (Fig. 4) , we infer that the hydrocarbon gas in KMV#5 consists of a mixture of gas of biogenic origin (nearly entirely CH 4 ) with a small amount of thermogenic gas. A two-end-member mixing curve between biogenic gas characterized by d 13 C CH4 = −39.5 to −29‰ and C 1 /C 2 = 2000 to 6200 and thermogenic gas with d 13 C CH4 = −45 to −40‰ and C 1 /C 2 = 8 to 11 (table S8 and Supplementary Text) suggests that biogenic CH 4 comprises >90% of the methane (Fig. 4A) . Given the in situ methane concentration in the Hybrid-PCS sample at 806 mM in pore water (~256 mol m −3 in wet sediment; Fig. 4A ), we estimate the concentrations of biogenic CH 4 and thermogenic CH 4 to be~725 mM (~230 mol m −3 ) and~81 mM (26 mol m −3 ), respectively. Although thermogenic CH 4 was estimated to account for less than 10% of total CH 4 , the concentration of thermogenic CH 4 amounting tõ 81 mM is substantially higher than the CH 4 solubility at in situ condition (44 to 54 mM), suggesting that expulsion of thermogenic CH 4 may help drive migration of the fluid and sediment here. Analyses of methane isotopologues provide additional evidence for a low-temperature, nonthermogenic origin of CH 4 in the mud volcano fluids. The ca. 30°C apparent equilibrium temperatures obtained from clumped isotopologue analyses of samples from 6.5 and 61.5 mbsf (Figs. 3B and 4D and table S2) suggest a predominance of methane that has been generated or biogeochemically cycled at relatively low temperatures (≪50°C). Similar D 13 CH 3 D values as well as d 13 C CH4 and dD CH4 values between the two samples suggest that CH 4 at 6.5 and 61.5 mbsf have the same origin(s). The D 13 CH 3 D values and D/H fractionation between CH 4 and the original pore water plot close to other biogenic gases from deep sedimentary environments ( Fig. 4D) (47) . Although the dD values of methane are 20‰ higher than expected for equilibrium, the KMV#5 data points are much closer to equilibrated biogenic gases than to previously reported thermogenic gases. These findings are consistent with generation of methane by microbes at low temperature and low growth rates (47, 48) . We calculate the maximum amount of time required to generate the total biogenic CH 4 to be 1.82 Ma, by dividing the in situ biogenic CH 4 concentration in the wet sediment (maximum, 398 mol m −3 ) by the potential hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rate (minimum, 0.6 pmol cm −3 day −1 ). This estimated duration does not exceed the age of nannofossils in sediments at KMV#5, which are late Early Miocene to early Middle Miocene (13.6 to 18.2 Ma) (17) . The potential activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at KMV#5 is comparable to those measured at the northern Cascadia margin (36) . Because incubations used to determine the potential methane production rate are conducted under high H 2 supply, rates of methanogenesis may be even slower in situ than indicated by the incubations. Relatively slow production of biogenic CH 4 is compatible with the near attainment of hydrogen isotopic equilibrium between methane and coexisting water at the temperature indicated by the methane isotopologue data (~30°C) (Fig. 4D) (47, 48) . We further estimated the average temperature at which the biogenic CH 4 was generated based on (i) the measured D 13 CH 3 D values, (ii) estimated biogenic fraction to total CH 4 (>90%), and (iii) the possible D 13 CH 3 D temperatures of a thermogenic CH 4 end-member (80°to 220°C) (see Supplementary Text). Assuming simple mixing between a single biogenic CH 4 end-member (d 13 C, −39.5‰; dD, −166‰) and a thermogenic CH 4 end-member (d 13 C, −40‰; dD, −229‰) (these values are assumed based on the data from Nankai Trough area; see Supplementary Text), we plotted mixing curves between the two endmembers, consistent with a D 13 CH 3 D temperature of 30°C for the CH 4 mixture ( fig. S9 and Supplementary Methods) . The mixing diagram indicates that the D 13 CH 3 D of the average biogenic component of CH 4 is <5.9‰ (>16°C in D 13 CH 3 D apparent equilibrium temperature). The possible range of the minimum D 13 CH 3 D temperature for the biogenic CH 4 is 13°to 17°C ( fig. S9 and Supplementary Methods) . On the basis of the in situ temperature profile in KMV#5 and the surrounding sedimentary basin, we suggest that biogenic CH 4 has been produced at 300 to 900 mbsf in the forearc basin, where temperatures range from 16°to 30°C (figs. S2 and S9). The minimum depth of the methanogenic zone was estimated to be~200 to 400 mbsf, depending on the assumed clumped isotope temperature of the biogenic CH 4 end-member (13°t o 17°C) ( fig. S9) . A 3D seismic volume over the study area showed that zones of high pore pressure occur at similar depths in the Kumano Basin along the megasplay fault (Fig. 1C) (18) . Because the mud volcanoes in the basin are located along this megasplay fault, these elevated pressure zones were thought to be the source of mud volcanoes (Fig. 1C) (18) . Such observations are consistent with the age of the sediments of KMV#5, which are late Early Miocene to early Middle Miocene (17) , indicating that the mud is originally derived from the bottom of forearc basin and not from the old accretionary prism. Together, our data indicate that biogenic CH 4 production in KMV#5 proceeds slowly in the deeper forearc basin (which sources the intruded mud) and is stimulated to action by a supply of water via the megasplay fault. Note that the pore water in the mud volcano sediments was freshened by the dewatering of clay minerals, which occurred in the old accretionary prism below the forearc basin ( fig. S2 ). Furthermore, a previous study inferred that the fluid in the mud volcanoes was derived from dehydration of sedimentary smectite and basaltic saponite in subducted sediments and basaltic crust (20) . Such a deeply sourced low-salinity fluid could conceivably travel upward along the megasplay fault (Fig. 6) . The high concentration of H 2 observed at KMV#5 might be related to the supply of deeply sourced fluid, stimulating methanogenesis and other anaerobic respiratory metabolisms mediated by H 2 , such as homoacetogenesis. The first use of Hybrid-PCS demonstrated that the in situ H 2 concentration in deep mud volcano sediments is three orders of magnitude higher than those previously measured in marine sediment samples (30) . However, the origin of H 2 is still under debate: In normal marine sediments, microbial H 2 production and consumption are closely coupled via interspecies hydrogen transfer in syntrophic relationships, and H 2 concentrations are kept at a low level to outcompete other hydrogenotrophic microbes that use terminal electron acceptors, which yield less free energy, while at the same time providing the minimal amount of energy needed to sustain the population (30) . However, in KMV#5, the high H 2 concentrations suggest that H 2 production and consumption are not coupled tightly, that is, a lack of microorganisms using H 2 or a supply of H 2 exceeding microbial consumption. Considering the total amount of H 2 necessary for the large amount of biogenic methane via hydrogenotrophic CO 2 reduction, as well as relatively low organic content in the mud volcano sediment and old accretionary prism, it is most likely that contributions of low-biomass communities to the vast H 2 production in situ (fermentation) would be much smaller than that of H 2 from abiotic processes. Given the geological setting of the Nankai subduction zone, we suggest that the high concentration of H 2 is possibly derived from coseismic fault friction and/or water-rock interactions in the old accretionary prism, as is the case with deeply derived lithium (Li) in the same mud volcano fluids (49) . It has been experimentally demonstrated that fault friction mechanoradically produces a large amount of H 2 (50) . Cell-specific hydrogenase activity in the deepest sample (61 nmol H 2 cell −1 day −1 ) was three orders of magnitude higher than both the shallowest sample (1.7 × 10 −2 nmol H 2 cell −1 day −1 at 1.5 mbsf; table S6) and the previously reported values (37) . The generally high cell-specific hydrogenase activity in deep mud volcano sediments may be due to a high dependence of microbial communities upon deeply sourced H 2 as their energy source. The high cell-specific hydrogenase activity, as well as the high potential rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis, suggests that microbial communities in the deep mud volcano biosphere have been stimulated by the geogenic H 2 and water in the Nankai accretionary complex. On the basis of the high potential rate of homoacetogenesis and the relationship of vertical profiles of d 13 C acetate , d 13 C TOC , and d 13 C DIC , we infer a large contribution of acetate production by homoacetogenesis to the acetate pool at depths shallower than the SMTZ. We infer that the acetate is mainly produced at shallow depths in situ on the basis of the vertical concentration profile of acetate (Fig. 3C) . The observed higher potential rate of homoacetogenesis than that of hydrogenotrophic methanogens is peculiar, however, because of the slight thermodynamic preference of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over homoacetogenesis throughout the cored depths (Fig. 5E ). However, the high potential rate of homoacetogenesis observed by our low-temperature incubation (4°C) is consistent with previous studies that incubated anoxic paddy soil or lake sediment and reported homoacetogenesis outcompeting hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for H 2 at temperatures below 15°to 20°C (51) . Considering that the D 13 CH 3 D temperature data indicate the occurrence of methanogenesis in the deeper forearc basin at a temperature of~15°C, we speculate that homoacetogenesis predominates in lower temperature horizons, including the cored depths, especially those shallower than~20 mbsf. The much lower cell abundances in the deep mud volcano sediments relative to those observed in the Kumano sedimentary basin at the same depths (down to 120 mbsf) ( Fig. 5A ) suggest that microbes are derived not from the surrounding sediments through which the mud rises but from the original mud reservoir. The mud reservoir, a deeper and older sedimentary realm than the surrounding basin sediments, is presumably more sparsely populated than the shallow basinal sediments. Our DNA and lipid data revealed that relatively small communities occur even in the deeply derived mud volcano sediments. More than 99.9% of the total 16S sequence reads are classified into taxonomic clusters that predominantly involve psychrophilic to mesophilic microbes, suggesting that most microbes are derived from the original mud reservoir in the forearc sedimentary basin. b-diversity analysis shows that both bacterial and archaeal communities in deep sediment samples are compositionally different from those in the shallow sulfate reduction and AOM zones (figs. S5 and S6). This trend indicates that some commonly distributed bacterial members (for example, Sphingomonadales, Atribacteria, and Chloroflexi) are derived potentially from the mud reservoir and that they contribute to carbon cycling in these sediments (Fig. 5B ). Archaeal communities in deep mud volcano samples are predominantly composed of Bathyarchaeota (34, 35) and Methanosarcinales-relatives, which are markedly different from shallow communities dominated by ANME-1, Marine Benthic Group-B, and Nitrosopumilus-relatives ( Fig. 5C and figs. S5 and S6) . The detection of Methanosarcinales-relatives in the deep mud volcano samples is consistent with the detection of intact PG-OH-AR, which is a signature lipid of the Methanosarcinales-related ANME-2 at 120 mbsf. Recent metagenomic studies of Bathyarchaeota show that two genomes contain divergent homologs of the genes necessary for CH 4 Fig. 6 . Schematic figure illustrating methanogenesis in the deep mud volcano sediments associated with fluid migration via the megasplay fault. The cross-section is based on seismic profiles (see Fig. 1 and fig. S1 ). and fermentations (52) . The presence of Bathyarchaeota in the mud volcano community suggests that those archaeal members might play some ecological roles in carbon cycling; however, it is currently not known whether the detected Bathyarchaeota are capable of methanogenesis, acetogenesis, or fermentation in the mud reservoir. In addition to those presumably psychrophilic to mesophilic members that have often been observed in cold to warm subseafloor sediments, the 16S gene library includes sequences of some unexpected members, which may reflect environmental conditions in the mud reservoir or the deeper old accretionary prism. For example, the occurrence of SCG archaea, which have been detected so far mainly in methanogenic low-salinity terrestrial soils (53, 54) and rarely in deep subseafloor sediments, may point to low-salinity conditions in the mud reservoir. This would be consistent with a selection or preferential stimulation of population members that prefer low-salinity conditions for their osmoregulatory functions because of the freshwater supply from clay dehydration. Furthermore, the successful isolation of strain 1H1 [related to M. mazei, which grows at temperatures between 2°a nd 50°C with optimum growth at 40°C, and under low NaCl concentrations down to 0 g liter −1 ( fig. S7 and Supplementary Text)] strongly supports our notion that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurs in the warm, low-salinity environment, as predicted by the pore water chemistry, clumped methane isotopologue, and seismic survey data (Fig. 6 ). It is important to discuss here the carbon budget within KMV#5. The CH 4 contents in sediments of KMV#5 averaged 6.4 m 3 CH 4 ·m −3 with a maximum value of 11 m 3 CH 4 ·m −3 at standard temperature and pressure. Such CH 4 contents are comparable to values determined by using gas-tight coring at the Haakon Mosby mud volcano in the Norwegian Sea (average of 15 m 3 CH 4 ·m −3 , maximum of 34 m 3 CH 4 ·m −3 as hydrate-bound CH 4 ) (8). In the active Haakon Mosby mud volcano, the temperature gradient is very high, up to 17°C m −1 , because of the high flux of warm fluid through a central conduit toward the seafloor. Thus, gas hydrate occurrence is limited to shallow depths below seafloor (1 to 15 mbsf), and the total mass of hydrate-bound CH 4 there was estimated to be 102.5 kt, equal to 2 × 10 8 m 3 (8) . On the basis of the data obtained from such active mud volcanoes, the total budget of CH 4 hydrates stored in submarine mud volcanoes in the world was previously estimated to be~10 10 to 10 12 m 3 (5) . However, the temperature gradient at KMV#5 (29°C km −1 ) is notably lower than other active submarine mud volcanoes, resulting in a vast and stable cylindrical GHSZ down to 590 m below the summit. We calculated the methane hydrate saturation in pore space to be 2.8 to 22.6% (10.4% in average) by using the data from Hybrid-PCS samples; this is comparable to Haakon Mosby (up to 21.3%) (8) . Furthermore, the methane hydrate saturation in pore space is consistent with estimates based on the values of d 18 O H2O and dD H2O below~5 mbsf (14 to 22% on average), indicating that methane hydrates are most likely homogenously present in the conduit of the intruded mud throughout the GHSZ. If the KMV#5 muddy sediments contain 6.4 m 3 CH 4 ·m −3 in situ as measured in Hybrid-PCS samples, then the cylindrical conduit (~1000 m in diameter, 590 m in depth down to the lower boundary of GHSZ) should harbor 3.2 × 10 9 m 3 of CH 4 . This is one order of magnitude larger than previous estimates of the amount of CH 4 in other active submarine mud volcanoes (~10 8 m 3 ) (5, 8) . Given the global distribution of submarine mud volcanoes along the plate convergent margin, we infer that mud volcanoes of the type found in the Kumano Basin are quantitatively more important reservoirs of CH 4 than previously thought. As there are at least 10 mud volcanoes whose mud volcanic activity is similar to or less than KMV#5 in this area (17, 19) , the total CH 4 budget in all submarine mud volcanoes of the Kumano Basin is at least~10 10 m 3 , which is comparable to the previous minimum estimate of CH 4 in submarine mud volcanoes worldwide (5) . The global CH 4 budget in submarine mud volcanoes is most likely underestimated; if we assume that the total amount/quantity of methane could apply to the global submarine mud volcanoes, then the total budget of methane might be one order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate (~10 11 to 10 13 m 3 ). Nevertheless, to accurately characterize the CH 4 budget and its biogeochemical significance in submarine mud volcanic systems, further systematic investigations at various geologic and oceanographic settings are necessary. Our results suggest that the previous assessment of ""biogenic"" versus ""thermogenic"" based on C 1 /C 2 and d 13 C CH4 is not simply applicable to some environments found in complex plate convergent margins. In terrestrial mud volcanoes, the elevated d 13 C CH4 values (−46.5‰ on average) and mostly high C 1 /C 2 (>500) have been attributed to a thermogenic source, in which a molecular separation during the gas migration causes high C 1 /C 2 ratios (15) . Given this interpretation, the fraction of thermogenic gas in the terrestrial mud volcanoes was estimated to be~76%. In marked contrast, our results suggest that such elevated d 13 C CH4 and C 1 /C 2 values are possibly consistent with biogenic gas. If this is the case for other mud volcanoes, then the contribution of biogenic methane might be significantly larger than previously estimated. Because mud volcanoes are a significant source of radiocarbon-free methane to the atmosphere (6), the contribution of subseafloor microbial activity to global carbon cycling may be larger than has been assumed. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive view of the mechanism of biogenic CH 4 production in the deep mud volcano biosphere. Geogenic reactions caused by heat and/or pressure in the landward old accretionary prism provide water through clay dehydration, hydrogen, and other organic substrates to the overlying forearc sedimentary basin, coincidently stimulating in situ microbial activities such as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. As a consequence of such geosphere-biosphere interactions, large amounts of biogenic CH 4 are stored as methane hydrates in the mud volcano interior or as free gas in the overpressured sedimentary basin. Similar interactions are possibly globally distributed beneath the ocean along the plate convergent margins, and this type of geobiological system could contribute more substantially to the global carbon budget than previously thought.  All sediment samples used in this study were obtained at Site C9004 on the summit of KMV#5 in the central Kumano Basin of the Nankai Trough [33°67.581′N, 136°56.8085′E; 1986.7-m water depth (Fig. 1A) ]. Shallow sediment samples at Site C9004 were collected using a 4-m piston corer by the research vessel Hakuhomaru during the KH06-04 cruise in 2006. Shallow to deep sediment samples were obtained by using HPCS down to 200 m below the summit during the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) Expeditions 903 and 906 of the drilling vessel Chikyu in 2009 and 2012, respectively. During Expedition 906, in addition to HPCS cores, pressure-conserved sediment cores were recovered by using Hybrid-PCS (22) , immediately ice-shocked onboard to prevent temperature increase, and then transferred to the Pressure Core Analysis and Transfer System (PCATS) (Geotek Co. Ltd.) for subsequent gas production tests and geochemical analyses. During the transfer of the Hybrid-PCS core using PCATS, x-ray CT scanning as well as g-ray and P-wave velocity measurements were simultaneously conducted. On the basis of the nondestructive physical property data, the core was cut into subsections at the selected point under high-pressure conditions, and then the subsection was transferred to a short aluminum chamber. Gas production tests were conducted using the short high-pressure core samples: Under the controlled depressurization, gas was forced out from the high-pressure chamber, collected by an inverted graduated cylinder in a water column for the volume measurement. A part of the extracted gas was sampled for the compositional analysis. Gas samples for analyses of H 2 concentration and clumped isotopes of methane (D 13 CH 3 D) were collected directly from the depressurized manifold during the production test and then stored in preevacuated glass vials and stainless steel cylinders, respectively. All pore water sample acquisition and measurements were carried out in the geochemistry laboratory onboard the Chikyu. In short, Cl − and SO 4 2− concentrations in this study were analyzed by titration and ion chromatography, respectively, according to the IODP standard protocols. Sediment samples for headspace gas analysis were collected using tip-cut plastic syringes immediately after core recovery. The syringe end was tightly capped with a silicone-rubber stopper on the corecutting area of the Chikyu, transferred to a glass vial in a N 2 -flushed glove bag, and then capped with a Teflon-coated rubber septum and aluminum seal for subsequent geochemical analyses. Hydrocarbon compositions in headspace gas and Hybrid-PCS gas samples were measured by using gas chromatography (GC)-flame ionization detector and GC-thermal conductivity detector on the Chikyu. H 2 concentrations in headspace gas and Hybrid-PCS samples were measured using a GC-trace reduction gas detector (30) immediately after sampling. The total H 2 volume in a Hybrid-PCS sample (core 5P-2 at 61.5 mbsf; table S3) was calculated by multiplying the averaged concentration of two subsamples collected during the production test to the total gas volume in the high-pressure chamber. The H 2 concentration in pore water was then calculated by dividing the total H 2 volume by pore volume. (55) . The acetate concentration and d 13 C acetate were determined by isotope ratio monitoring-liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (irm-LC-MS) (Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP IRMS connected to LC IsoLink) (28) . TOC content and d 13 C TOC were determined, after removal of carbonate with HCl, by using a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP IRMS instrument connected to a Flash EA 1112 Automatic Elemental analyzer via a ConFlo III interface. The d 13 C values of hydrocarbon gases and dD CH4 were determined via irm-GC-MS (21, 55) (Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP IRMS connected to TRACE GC via GC Combustion III) and high-temperature conversion interface, respectively. The D 13 CH 3 D of methane in Hybrid-PCS gas samples was measured by tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (3, 25, 47) .  Plugs of 1-cm 3 sediment were collected from the innermost part of the cores using sterilized syringes (tips cut off) and then immediately fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for~12 hours at 4°C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, and suspended in PBSethanol solution (1:1) at a final dilution volume of 10% (v/v). Cell counts were performed by both manual microscopic observation and image-based cell enumeration techniques using SYBR Green I fluorescent dye (31) . All sediment samples used for molecular analyses were immediately frozen at −80°C and then stored in deep freezers before use. DNA was extracted from 10 g of the frozen sample using the PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Despite the generally low cell abundance in deep mud volcano sediments, bacterial and archaeal 16S fragments were directly obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) without any multiple displacement amplification. To identify the taxonomic composition, we sequenced the V1-V2 and V3-V4 hypervariable regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S genes, respectively, using a GS FLX sequencer. In short, PCR amplification for sequencing was performed using domain-specific primers (EUB27F and EUB338Rmix for Bacteria, and UNIV530F and ARC912R for Archaea) with 454 FLX Titanium adapters A and B and a six-base sample identifier tag (56) . No PCR products were obtained from 19.3 and 119 mbsf each for bacterial and archaeal 16S, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C) . No PCR amplifications could be seen in all negative control experiments. Detailed methods for taxonomic classification of the sequence reads, data processing for operational taxonomic unit picking, and b-diversity analyses were described in Supplementary Methods. Sediment samples used for activity measurements by incubation with 14 C-labeled substrates were collected from whole-round core sections that were immediately cut after core recovery and stored under anoxic conditions flushed with Ar at 4°C until onshore distribution to vials. A sulfate-free mineral solution, in which Cl − was adjusted to 86 mM, was added to make slurries. The headspace was flushed by N 2 , and H 2 concentrations were adjusted to 20 mM in water before 14 C-labeled substrates (bicarbonate and acetate, 2 MBq) were added to each vial. After incubation for 130 days at 4°C, the activities associated with hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis, as well as homoacetogenesis, were measured using modifications of previously described methods (36, 57) . The instrument detection limit of the liquid scintillation counting was 0.4 Bq. The method detection limit was determined by the analysis of negative control samples prepared by the autoclave sterilization of sediment samples before the injection of 14 C-labeled substrates. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetogenesis from the negative control samples with 14 Cbicarbonate did not exceed the instrument detection limit (0.4 Bq, equal to 0.0002 pmol cm −3 day −1 ), and acetoclastic methanogenesis from the negative control with 14 C-labeled acetate was 9 Bq (equal to 0.004 pmol cm −3 day −1 ). Sediment samples used for hydrogenase activity measurement were collected from the core-cutting area using sterilized tip-cut plastic syringes immediately after core recovery. Hydrogenase activity was measured as described previously (37) . In short, samples were incubated with a tritium gas headspace, and because of the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme, tritiated water will be produced and its activity can be quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The Gibbs free energies for homoacetogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and acetoclastic methanogenesis were calculated on the basis of in situ geochemical and geophysical measurement data [H 2 concentration is 28.1 mM, and CH 4 concentrations are saturated values (44 to 54 mM)], as described previously (2) . We also calculated the energy yield by using the H 2 concentration measured by headspace gas, because the in situ H 2 concentration analyzed from only one Hybrid-PCS sample was uncertain. Total lipid extracts were obtained from~20 g of freeze-dried sediments using a modified Bligh and Dyer protocol (38) , after adding an internal standard (phosphatidylcholine C 21:0/21:0 ). Analysis of IPLs was performed by high-performance LC electrospray ionization MS (HPLC-ESI-MS). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters Acquity BEH C18 column (58) with a Dionex Ultimate 3000RS UHPLC coupled to a maXis quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an ESI source. Detection of lipids was performed in positive ionization mode while scanning a massto-charge (m/z) range from 150 to 2000. MS2 scans were obtained in data-dependent mode, and for each MS full scan, up to three MS2 experiments, targeting the most abundant ions, were performed. Active exclusion limits the times a given ion is selected for fragmentation (three times every 0.5 min) and thus allowed us to also obtain MS2 data of less abundant ions. Lipid identification was achieved by monitoring exact masses of possible parent ions (present as either H + , NH 4 + , or Na + adducts) in combination with characteristic fragmentation patterns (59) . Lipid quantification was achieved by comparison of parent ion responses relative to known amounts of an internal standard (58) . Batch-type cultivation of microbial communities in KMV#5 was tested using six sediment samples at 20°and 55°C under the anaerobic condition. Strain 1H1 was successfully isolated from the primary enrichment culture obtained from a sample at 12.82 mbsf. The detailed methods for cultivation conditions including the media used, isolation of strain 1H1, taxonomic identification, and physiological characterizations are described in Supplementary Methods.

12345051,"Chemosymbiotic bivalves from the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz, NE Atlantic, with descriptions of new species of Solemyidae, Lucinidae and Vesicomyidae","The chemosymbiotic bivalves collected from the mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz are reviewed. Of the thirteen species closely associated with chemosynthetic settings two Solemyidae, Solemya (Petrasma) elarraichensis sp. n. and Acharax gadirae sp. n., one Lucinidae, Lucinoma asapheus sp. n., and one Vesicomyidae, Isorropodon megadesmus sp. n. are described and compared to close relatives of their respective families. The biodiversity and distribution of the chemosymbiotic bivalves in the Gulf of Cadiz are discussed and compared to the available information from other cold seeps in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. Although there is considerable similarity at the genus level between seep/mud volcano fields in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, there is little overlap at the species level. This indicates a high degree of endemism within chemosymbiotic bivalve assemblages.","Chemosynthetic bivalves are prominent constituents of the fauna of cold seeps and are represented in that setting by five families: Solemyidae, Lucinidae, Vesicomyidae, Thyasiridae and Mytilidae (Sibuet and Olu 1998 , Sibuet and Olu-Le Roy 2002 , Sahling et al. 2003 , Levin 2005 . Recently the presence of bacteria in the gills in species of Nucinella and Huxleyia has been demonstrated (Oliver and Taylor in preparation) , confirming the previous inclusion of the Manzanellidae in this group (Cosel and Bouchet 2008) . The occurrence of chemosymbiotic bivalves in the extensive mud volcano fields of the Gulf of Cadiz was first reported by Pinheiro et al. (2003) . Then followed a series of more in-depth studies: on polychaete commensals of solemyid hosts (Ravara et al. 2007 ); on the distribution and taxonomy of Thyasiridae (Rodrigues et al. 2008) ; on the phylogenetic relationships of Bathymodiolus mauritanicus Cosel (Génio et al. 2008) and on the molecular characterization of chemosymbiotic endosymbionts of solemyids, lucinids, thyasirids and mytilids . Chemosynthetic bivalve faunas have been discovered elsewhere in the Eastern Atlantic, notably off tropical West Africa (Cosel and Salas 2001 , Olu-Le Roy et al. 2007 , Cosel and Olu 2009 ) and in the eastern Mediterranean (Salas and Woodside 2002 , Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004 , Carlier et al. 2010 . For the Vesicomyidae, at the species level, these faunas are considered disparate Salas 2001, Krylova and . Conversely studies on Bathymodiolus suggest that the species occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz is not only found along the West African margin but is amphi-Atlantic (Génio et al. 2008) . The biogeographic patterns within these faunas are currently unresolved and require further taxonomic characterization, which this paper begins to address. This paper intends to provide the taxonomic basis for the chemosynthetic bivalves in the Gulf of Cadiz and includes the description of two new species of Solemyidae, one new species of Lucinidae and one new species of Vesicomyidae. Notes on the biogeography of these taxa in the Atlantic are given with special emphasis on the relationships between the Eastern Mediterranean, Gulf of Cadiz and West Africa. Study area. The Gulf of Cadiz is located in the NE Atlantic Ocean between 34°N and 37°15'N and 6°W to 9°45'W. It is enclosed by the southern Iberian and northern Moroccan margins, west of Gibraltar Strait. The geological history of the Gulf of Cadiz is intimately related to plate tectonic interaction between Southern Eurasia and North Africa and is driven by two major mechanisms: a) subduction associated with the westward emplacement of the Gibraltar Arc and formation of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge, probably not active at present and b) oblique lithosphere collision between Iberia and Nubia, active at present and causing active thrusting (Zitellini et al. 2009 ). It is now well established that the whole area is under compressive deformation and that mud volcanism and processes associated with the escape of hydrocarbon-rich fluids sustain a broad diversity of chemosynthetic assemblages. This extensive area encompasses over forty mud volcanoes (here after as MV), at depths ranging from 200 to 4000m (confirmed by coring) (Mazurenko et al. 2002 , Pinheiro et al. 2003 , Magalhães 2007 , and active methane seepage has been documented on several locations , Gardner 2001 , Niemann et al. 2006 , Stadnitskaia et al. 2006 , Hensen et al. 2007 . Biological samples were available from 30 sites but for this study only thirteen MVs and one structure (PDE) yielded chemosymbiotic bivalves (Fig. 1) . In the shallow Moroccan margin the El Arraiche field encompasses Renard Ridge (including Pen Duick Escarpment), Vernadsky Ridge and several mud volcanoes (e.g. Al Idrisi, Mercator, Fíuza, Gemini, Kidd MVs) located at depths from 200 to approximately 600m depth: The proximity to the euphotic zone and to the African coast adds to the great productivity observed in the area. Dead cold-water scleractinean coral reefs, carbonate crusts and exposed carbonate chimneys characterize the Renard and Vernadsky Ridges. Carbonate crusts, rock blocks and clasts are often found in the craters of the shallow mud volcanoes where mild seepage activity has been recorded (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005) . Mercator MV, one of the shallowest mud volcanoes differs significantly from the other mud volcanoes by the high chloride enrichment of its pore water (Van Rensbergen et al. 2005) . The top of Mercator MV shows patches of disturbed sediments from which gas venting is occasionally observed. Solitary corals (Caryophyllia sp.), accompanied by Cidaridae echinoids and Onuphidae polychaetes (Hyalinoecia) are the most conspicuous organisms seen during video surveys of the Mercator MV crater. The western Moroccan field comprises several mud volcanoes (e.g. Meknès, Student, Yuma, Ginsburg, Jesus Baraza, Darwin MVs) at intermediate depths (700-1200m) located along an extensive province of carbonate and mostly dead cold-water coral mounds. The widespread presence of authigenic carbonates and also extensive Neptunea and Bathymodiolus graveyards (usually within the crater of the mud volcanoes) suggest that this was a very active seepage area in the past. Darwin MV differs from the others in this area because its crater is completely covered by large carbonate slabs and crusts. The fissures among slabs and depressions with scattered crust are filled with abundant shell ash and occasionally small clumps of living Bathymodiolus mauritanicus Cosel, 2002 . Meknès MV is the southernmost Moroccan mud volcano rising isolated among an extensive field of small coral mounds. The crater is formed by stiff, sometimes heavily disturbed, green mud breccia with scattered clasts and a striking large number of empty shells of the gastropod Neptunea. Except for a few Paromola individuals, living megafauna is rarely sighted in the crater The deep-water field (1300-4000m), mostly within the Portuguese margin includes several mud volcanoes (e.g. Captain Arutyunov, Carlos Ribeiro, Bonjardim and Porto MVs) that are aligned along major crustal strike-slip faults associated with the African-Eurasian plate boundary (Duarte et al. 2005) . Gas hydrates were recovered from these mud volcanoes and the methane concentrations yield the highest records from the Gulf of Cadiz (Kenyon et al. , 2003 Akhmetzhanov et al. 2007 Akhmetzhanov et al. , 2008 . Video surveys of these deeper mud volcanoes often show conspicuous siboglinid fields (e.g. Porto MV) in the active craters and exuberant sponge and gorgonian patches at the crater rim and upper flank (e.g. Carlos Ribeiro MV). Sampling. Samples were collected between 2002 and 2006 during TTR (Training Through Research) 12, TTR 14, TTR15 and TTR16 cruises onboard RV Prof. Logachev and MSM.01-03 cruise onboard RV Maria S. Merian (IFM-GEOMAR). The material was collected using TV-assisted grabs or USNEL box-corers. Occasionally faunal specimens were also recovered from Reineck box-corer, multiple corer or lander samples that were carried out for different purposes. Whenever possible the specimens were sorted onboard and preserved in 70 or 96% ethanol (the latter preserved for molecular analysis). Measurements. All measurements were made using Sylvac™ vernier calipers accurate to 0.01mm but are given to the nearest tenth.  Order Solemyoida Dall, 1889 Superfamily Solemyoidea Gray, 1840 Family Solemyidae Gray, 1840 Solemyids are among the most ancient bivalves dating from the Paleozoic (Métivier and Cosel 1993) . They are protobranch in organization and characterized by an elongate shell (up to 220mm) with a posteriorly situated toothless hinge. The thick brown periostracum is much larger than the calcified part of the valve and is folded inwards by the muscular mantle edge upon closing of the valves (Métivier and Cosel 1993) . Solemyidae taxonomy is complex. Taylor et al. (2008) and Kamenev (2009) recognized two extant genera, Solemya and Acharax, with a further four subgenera within Solemya, namely Petrasma, Austrosolemya Solemyarina and Zesolemya. Solemyids, other than Acharax are generally found at continental shelf and upper-slope depths (0 to 600m), although Solemya (Petrasma) pervernicosa has been recorded at 1500m (Kamenev 2009) . Acharax is generally restricted to deep-sea settings from ~400m on the continental slope to the deepest sites of the Japan Trench (Neulinger et al. 2006) . Shallow dwelling solemyids live in sediments with high organic matter content, often at reduced oxygen concentrations. Hydrogen sulphide is frequently present due to sulphate reduction coupled with organic matter degradation (Conway et al. 1992) . In contrast, the genus Acharax has been recovered from cold seep locations (see review by Sibuet and Olu 1998) and in sediments influenced by hydrothermal venting (Juniper et al. 1992, Métivier and Cosel 1993) . Acharax species are morphologically similar but molecular data suggests a degree of cryptic speciation (Neulinger et al. 2006) . Superficially, all solemyids appear so similar that specimens discovered at various deep-sea sites might have been misclassified as Solemya (see review by Sibuet and Olu 1998 rior, posterior dorsal margin projecting a little. Beaks indistinct, umbos sunken. Hinge teeth absent. Ligament primarily internal, supported by a prominent chondrophore that extends only slightly as a chondrophore ridge around the posterior adductor, lacking posterior and anterior extensions but a small roughly heart shaped area is present in front of the chondrophore and this is also visible externally just behind the beaks. Periostracum persistent and extending well beyond the shell margin, initially yellowish brown in colour but darkening with growth to a dark chestnut brown. Sculpture of weak radial ridges, 5-6 over the posterior and 10-12 over median and anterior. Adductor scars impressed, dorsal part of posterior scar angulate where bounded by chondrophore ridge, anterior adductor scar larger, spatulate in outline. Anatomy (Figs 3G, 4) : The posterior siphonal opening is surrounded by a series of papillae: A single large dorsal papilla (dp) lies above two smaller but still large papillae (dmp) on the dorsal margin of the opening, below these is a short smooth section (sa) followed by a series of papillae increasing in size towards the ventral margin, there are 6 primary papillae (psp) on either side and a single ventral median papillae, between these on the inner side are smaller papillae (ssp); a pair of subsiphonal ridges (ssr) are present below the siphonal crown. The mantle edge is fused from the posterior siphon for half the length of the ventral margin where there is a large anterior pedal gape. The mantle edge surrounding the rear of the foot bears a few tabulate papillae (pgp). The anterior dorsal mantle edge is prominently papillate (dap) and there is a single papilla on the junction of the mantle edge anterior of the anterior adductor muscle (admp). The foot is very large with a broad oval sole, this fringed by large papillae, all equal in size. The ctenidium is large with numerous laminar filaments attached to a prominent gill axis. The palps are short, twisted and flattened with cup shaped terminations. The gut is present but difficult to examine due to its small dimensions but the hind gut and rectum were easily visible. Distribution. Solemya (P.) elarraichensis is presently only known from the mud volcano fields in the Gulf of Cadiz, Eastern Atlantic. The majority of specimens have been taken from the El Arraiche field off the coast of Morocco in Kidd, Fíuza and Mercator MVs and the Pen Duick Escarpment at depths between 358-560m. A few specimens have been taken from the Western Moroccan field at the Meknès, Yuma, Ginsburg and Darwin MVs at the slightly deeper range of 700-1115m. Etymology. elarraichensis, denoting the geographic origin of the type locality; the El Arraiche field. Remarks. The form of the ligament, which is primarily internal, supported by a chondrophore and lacks any lateral or anterior extensions, confirms the placement of S. (P.) elarraichensis in the subgenus Petrasma Dall, 1908 (Taylor et al. 2008 . Some of the specimens carry an initial identification of ""cf. Solemya togata"" as might be expected from the proximity to the Mediterranean but the ligament of Solemya s.s. has prominent anterior extensions (Fig. 3E) . The subgenus Petrasma is not known from the North-East Atlantic but is represented in the Western Atlantic by three species. Two species are known from near shore waters off the northeast coast of the USA: S. (P.) velum (Say, 1822) and S. (P.) borealis Taylor et al. 2009 ). c, chondrophore; cr chondrophore ridge; pa, posterior adductor scar; r, resilium. G posterior siphon of S. (P.) elarraichensis. dp, dorsal papilla; dmp, dorsal marginal papillae; psp, primary siphonal papillae; sa, smooth area; ssp, secondary siphonal papillae; ssr, subsiphonal ridge; vp, ventral papilla. (Totten, 1834) . The third, S. (P.) occidentalis (Deshayes 1857 ) is known from the warm waters of Florida, Caribbean and S. America (Mikkelsen and Bieler 2008) . We note that the curvature of the chondrophore and chondrophore ridge is cir- . Furthermore, the siphonal papillae of S. (P.) velum are by comparison less in number and reduced in development (Morse 1913 , Taylor et al. 2008 . Abbott (1974) following Morse (1913) noted that the siphon of S. (P.). borealis differed markedly from that of S. (P.) velum, confirming that siphonal characters were important for distinguishing species. In S. (P.) borealis, the ventral-most dorsal marginal papillae are very large, and as big as the dorsal papilla, and much larger than any of the ventral papillae. This contrasts with the condition in S. (P.) elarraichensis where the ventral-most dorsal marginal papillae are smaller than the dorsal papilla and where the ventral papillae are fewer in number and distinctly increasing in size ventrally, with the ventral-most papillae equal in size to the dorsal marginal papillae. Conway et al. (1992) , following Barnard (in Reid 1980) suggested that S. (P.) borealis lacked a gut and this would be in contrast with S. (P.) velum and S. (P.) elarraichensis. The character of the ligament and chondrophore are rather similar in S. (P.) elarraichensis and S. (P.) borealis. Abbott (1974) and Mikkelsen and Bieler (2008) note that S. (P.) occidentalis lacks any perceptible chondrophore ridge and give this as the main characteristic separating S. (P.) occidentalis from S. (P.) velum and, therefore, also from S. (P.) elarraichensis. Ecologically S. (P.) velum and S. (P.) borealis are very different from S. (P.) elarraichensis in that they are not associated with deep-water methane seeps. In contrast they are found in sublittoral or shallow shelf settings with high organic enrichment (Morse 1913 in Conway et al. 1992 ). Mikkelsen and Bieler (2008) give a similar habitat for S. (P.) occidentalis (Deshayes, 1857) noting its occurrence in mangrove channels and around sewage outfalls. Given the above differences in habitat and form we conclude that none of the Atlantic species is amphi-Atlantic, unlike S. (P.) pervernicosa Kuroda, 1948 , which is considered to be amphi-Pacific by Kamenev (2009) . If any of the Western Atlantic species were amphi-Atlantic it is unclear why, in the Eastern Atlantic, they should be absent from their typical settings (which are plentiful) and found only in deep water methane seeps. Other North Atlantic species referred to as Solemya, S. grandis Verrill and Bush, 1898 and S. caribbaea Vokes, 1970 are excluded here because both belong to the genus Acharax (Abbott 1974) . A solemyid living at a pockmark, at a depth of 1607m, has been reported from the Eastern Mediterranean . Unfortunately the small, single specimen was damaged and its taxonomic affinities remain unclear. In conclusion, there are sufficient morphological and ecological grounds for considering the Gulf of Cadiz species of Petrasma to be new to science. .

Description (Fig. 5 ) Calcified shell to 67mm in length, to 85mm including periostracal fringe. Robust. Equivalve. Inequilateral, beaks situated at 1/4 length of shell from posterior margin. Outline subcylindrical, compressed, calcified shell length about 3 times height, slightly deeper towards the anterior, dorsal and ventral margins subparallel, anterior margin more broadly rounded than anterior, posterior dorsal margin projecting a little. Including periostracal fringe, anterior appears greatly expanded compared with posterior. Beaks indistinct, umbos sunken. Hinge teeth absent. Ligament external, as a high arched band posterior of the beaks and supported by a thickened shell margin; an oval area of ligament is present immediately behind the beaks and visible internally, anterior of the beaks shell margins fused by periostracal material along entire dorsal margins. Periostracum persistent and extending well beyond the shell margin, initially yellowish brown in colour but darkening with growth to dark brown and black; periostracal frill thickened over ribs but entire. Sculpture of radial ridges, 4 closely spaced over the posterior; median area almost smooth with 2-3 low ribs; anterior with 8-9 deeply cut ribs. Adductor scars impressed, posterior scar subcircular, anterior adductor scar larger, spatulate in outline. Anterior inner shell margin scalloped corresponding to radial ribs. Posterior siphonal opening surrounded by a series of papillae ( Fig. 5E ): A single large dorsal papilla (dp) lies above 2-3 pairs of slightly smaller papillae (dmp) on the dorsal margin of the opening, below these surrounding the opening is a series of approximately alternating large and small papillae with those most ventral the largest. The mantle edge is fused from the posterior siphon for half the length of the ventral margin where there is a large anterior pedal gape. The mantle edge surrounding the rear of the foot is papillate. The anterior dorsal mantle edge is prominently papillate (Fig. 5D ). The foot is very large with a broad oval sole, the margin interdigitates between large and small blunt papillae. The ctenidium is large with numerous laminar filaments attached to a prominent gill axis. The palps are short, twisted and flattened with cup shaped terminations. The presence or absence of a gut could not be confirmed. Distribution. Acharax gadirae is presently only known from the mud volcano fields in the Gulf of Cadiz, Eastern Atlantic. The specimens have been taken from the Western Moroccan field at Yuma, Ginsburg and Jesus Baraza MVs, and from the deepwater field at Captain Arutyunov, Carlos Ribeiro and Porto MVs at depths between 975 to 3902m. A single specimen was recovered from the shallower El Arraiche field in Pen Duick Escarpment at 556m. Etymology. gadirae, from the Phoenician ""Gadir"" the original name for Cadiz and meaning ""walled fortification"" and also the root of many Moroccan names such as Agadir. Named to indicate the widespread range across the Moroccan and Iberian margins. Remarks. The genus Acharax is recognizable from the large external ligament and the generic placement of A. gadirae is confirmed. The genus is rare in the Atlantic Ocean unlike the situation in the Pacific where species of Acharax are frequently recorded from chemosynthetic settings (Neulinger et al. 2006 ). Only two species are known from the Atlantic. Acharax grandis (Verrill and Bush 1898 ) is known only from the original material collected from depths between 548 and 2926m in the region of the New York Bight. Acharax caribbaea (Vokes 1970) again is only recorded from the original material collected from a depth of 350m off Colombia in the Caribbean Sea. However, the genus is recorded in recent studies from both the Gulf of Mexico (Carney 1994 ) and the Barbados prism (Olu et al. 1997 ) but the species are not identified. Acharax grandis differs from both A. gadirae and A. caribbaea in being less inequilateral with the beaks distinctly more towards the mid-line. Acharax caribbaea differs from both A. gadirae and A. grandis in having very few (4) anterior ribs compared with the 6-8 on A. grandis and 8-9 on A. gadirae of similar size. Unfortunately, there are no anatomical data for either A. grandis or A. caribbaea, making a thorough comparison impractical. There are no given ecological data for either A. grandis or A. caribbaea. The type locality for A. grandis, which is the region around the Hudson Shelf and Canyon, has no recorded seep or vent activity. In contrast the region around the type locality of A. caribbaea is known for a variety of chemosynthetic settings (Carney 1994) . The bathymetric range of Acharax in the Gulf of Cadiz is large, 556-3902m and specimens have been taken at many mud volcanoes raising the possibility that more than one species is involved. Unfortunately the specimens from the abyssal sites are all small about 10mm or less making comparison with the large specimens from the bathyal sites inconclusive. The specimens from Carlos Ribeiro MV (2200m) (Fig. 6C-D) are prominently wedge shaped in outline compared with the specimen from Porto MV (3902m) (Fig. 6B) . The latter is not dissimilar to those from Capt. Arutyunov MV (1325m) (Fig. 6E) with the specimen from Pen Duick Escarpment (556m) (Fig. 6A ) somewhat more elongate but not as wedge shaped as those from Carlos Ribeiro MV. The specimens from the Capt Arutyunov MV are most problematic in that the siphonal opening appears to be devoid of any surrounding tentacles or papillae (Fig. 6H) . This does not appear to be a function of size as similar specimens from other sites have siphonal papillae. Should this observation be confirmed in further material it would be appropriate to describe this as a separate species. Comparing the siphonal papillae of specimens from Pen Duick Escarpment (Fig. 6F) and Carlos Ribeiro MV (Fig. 6G) indicates a more complex arrangement in the latter but, with so few specimens, this is inconclusive. The Lucinidae is, by far, the most disparate and species-rich family of chemosymbiotic bivalves and are thoroughly reviewed by Taylor and Glover (2006) . Although they occupy a wide range of habitats, they are relatively infrequent in deep-sea settings (Taylor and Glover 2009) . Some species are associated with cold seeps and mud volcanoes, oxygen minimum zones and a single species is known from a hydrothermal vent (Taylor and Glover 2006) . Of most frequent occurrence in, but not exclusive to, deep-sea settings is the genus Lucinoma (Salas and Woodside 2002 , Oliver and Holmes 2006a , Cosel 2006 , Cosel and Bouchet 2008 . Oliver and Holmes (2006a) and Cosel (2006) both comment on the considerable variation in shell form observed in some species, L. gagei Holmes, 2006a and L. myriamae Cosel, 2006 respectively. This contrasts with the relatively small morphological differences cited for the discrimination of other species, e.g. L. kazani (Salas and Woodside 2002) and L. vestita (Dautzenberg and Fischer 1906 in Cosel 2006) . In the latter instances geographic isolation and habitat preferences have played a major role in the in the interpretation of the significance of morphological variation. Description (Fig. 7) . Shell to 34 mm in length. Solid. Equivalve. Equilateral. Tumidity variable (Fig. 7G, H) but mostly rather compressed. Umbos low, beaks pointing forward. Outline lenticular; posterior dorsal margin almost straight, sloping gently; posterior margin curved but less so than anterior; anterior dorsal margin short, a little concave. Escutcheon narrow, edges slightly raised, extending the length of the posterior dorsal margin; three-quarters filled by ligament, remainder smooth. Lunule distinct, width dependant on tumidity of shell; edges raised, sharp. Sculpture of numerous, low but erect, thin, concentric lamellae; between lamellae are weak concentric lines. Ligament external as a prominent, raised, arched band. Set on a narrow nymph. Hinge weak; two small cardinal teeth in each valve, RV anterior and LV posterior weakly bifid; anterior lateral protuberance distinct to obscure. Pallial line entire. Anterior adductor scar greatly elongate, approximately 3/4 free from pallial line. Shell white, periostracum thin but persistent, straw coloured (all material collected has been stained in Rose Bengal, thus the pink tinge). The anatomy is essentially that described for L. borealis by Allen (1958) and for L. kazani by Salas and Woodside (2002) . The inhalant siphon is surrounded by numerous short tentacles and papillae (Fig. 7I) Variation. The shell can be rather compressed (Fig. 7H) or tumid ( Fig. 7G ) and this may be related to age rather than size as suggested by Oliver and Holmes (2006a) for L. gagei from the Arabian Sea. Some shells also show distortion with radial depressions developing abruptly (Fig. 7E) . Molecular data. Tissues were sent to Dr. John Taylor (NHM, London) for inclusion in his survey of Lucinidae and the 16S and CO1 genes were compared with those of Lucinoma borealis. The results although not entirely conclusive indicate that the two populations are not conspecific. More recently, John Taylor's group has demonstrated that L. kazani and L. borealis are distinct (J. Taylor pers. comm). Distribution. Only found live at Mercator MV in the Gulf of Cadiz (358m). Etymology. asapheus from asaphes Greek: meaning ""indistinct"" and ""baffling"", referring to the lack of distinctive morphological characters and the consequent unsettling taxonomic issues. Remarks. A morphometric analysis was done comparing the Gulf of Cadiz shells with those of L. borealis from numerous localities from around the British Isles. This analysis could not demonstrate any statistically valid differences in the outline, the relative size of the anterior adductor scar (aa l on Fig. 7B) scar from the pallial line (aa d on Fig. 7B ). It should be noted that the Cadiz sample size was small and that conclusive probability results were unlikely. However, the variation in tumidity and irregularity of some of the Cadiz shells is not found in samples of L. borealis. Anatomically L. asapheus and L. borealis are alike including the papillae that surround the inhalant aperture. Further evidence for the species level distinction between L. asapheus and L. borealis comes from the molecular data but here again the few specimens available curtails the analysis. Ecologically one might expect mud volcanoes and near shore sulphide enriched sediments to support different species. This argument was used by Salas and Woodside (2002) to support the distinction between L. kazani and L. borealis, but they also listed some morphological differences and this has been supported by molecular data (J. Taylor pers comm). Some of these, namely the tumidity of the valves, the width of the lunule and the expression of the lateral teeth are found here to be variable and therefore not conclusive. Similar variability was recorded for L. gagei (Oliver and Holmes 2006a) and L. myriamae (Cosel 2006) Cosel, 2006 from the Angola margin at c.360m. Comparisons with L. asapheus are as follows. Lucinoma vestita is a smaller species not exceeding 16mm in length, more rounded in outline and with a weak sculpture of poorly developed (often absent) comarginal lamellae. Lucinoma atalantae has a distinctly longer and more steeply sloping anterior dorsal margin, a more angular posterior profile and irregular sculpture. Lucinoma myriamae is much larger reaching over 50mm in length and has a distinct angular anterior profile; in this respect, it resembles L. saldanhae Barnard, 1964 a species not considered by Cosel (2006) . The Thyasiridae of the Gulf of Cadiz were reported on by Rodrigues et al. (2008) and of the seven species recognized only one was closely associated with active mud volcanoes, namely T. vulcolutre Rodrigues & Oliver, 2008 ). Here we report upon an additional species to the Gulf of Cadiz from the Captain Arutyunov MV. Since the publication of Rodrigues et al. (2008) thyasirids from the Eastern Mediterranean mud volcanoes and the REGAB site off West Africa have become available for study. These species will not be described here but are compared with T. vulcolutre. Type species. Spinaxinus sentosus Oliver & Holmes, 2006b Definition. As given by Oliver and Holmes (2006b (Fig. 8A-D) . This specimen measures only 2.3 mm in length and is damaged. The outline agrees with that of S. sentosus in being extended anteriorly with a long lunule depression and in the presence of a long but shallow posterior sulcus. These features are in contrast to the juveniles of Thyasira vulcolutre (Rodrigues and Oliver 2008) , which also occurs at similar depths and settings. The periostracal spines are typical of Spinaxinus but are not seen in this specimen. The periostracum is coarse and the vestiges of lamellae and projections can be seen on the extreme edges of the shell especially on the ventral margin. Remarks. Although the identification is not conclusive the likelihood that this shell is a juvenile Spinaxinus is high and as such represents the first finding of this species in a non-anthropogenic setting. The proximity of the type locality (off northern Portugal) to the Cadiz mud volcanoes makes this supposition more reasonable. http://species-id.net/wiki/Thyasira_vulcolutre Comments. Thyasira vulcolutre belongs to a group of thyasirids with relatively large shells with weakly defined posterior sulci. It was concluded that it was most similar to T. southwardae (Oliver and Holmes 2006b ) from the Anyas Garden site. At that time no thyasirid material had been found at cold seep sites along the West African margin. Consequently, unlike the situation for Lucinoma (Cosel 2006) and Isorropodon Salas 2001, Cosel and Olu 2008) no further biogeographic comparisons could be made. Recently we were able to examine a thyasirid (Fig.  8E-F ) from the REGAB site (courtesy of Karine Olu) and although it superficially resembles T. vulcolutre it significantly differs in having a minutely spicate periostracum (Oliver in prep) . Thyasira striata Sturany, 1896 has long been known from deep water in the eastern Mediterranean but was recently re-discovered at cold seep sites (Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004 ). Small specimens resemble T. flexuosa but larger examples (Fig. 8G-H ) are very tumid with prominent lunule and deep posterior sulci quite unlike T. vulcolutre. These new data suggest that those thyasirids closely associated with active cold seeps have restricted ranges within the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean region. The family Vesicomyidae has become familiar as a group of large chemosymbiotic clams associated with hot vents (Boss and Turner 1980, Tunnicliffe 1991) and cold seeps (Turner 1985, Okutani and Métivier 1986 ) and exemplified by Calyptogena magnifica Boss and Turner 1980 . Not all taxa are large and the smallest, such as Vesicomya atlantica, are probably not chemosymbiotic (Allen 2001) . Despite their conspicuous presence in many reducing environments, the taxonomy of vesicomyids is far from being settled, at both the species and supraspecific levels (Krylova and Sahling 2006) . Different authors estimate that the family includes from 50 to more than 70 recent and fossil species and new species are constantly erected (Cosel and Salas 2001 , Krylova and Sahling 2006 , Krylova and Janssen 2006 , Cosel and Olu 2009 Description. (Figs 9, 10C-D) . To 15mm in length. Thin. Equivalve. Inequilateral, beaks in front of the midline. Compressed, length to tumidity ratio 2.3 to 2.5. Outline subovate, anterior rounded, posterior a little obliquely truncated; ventral curvature at its maximum well to the posterior of the mid line. Lunule indistinct, not depressed. Escutcheon narrow, deeply excavated but entirely occupied by ligament. Sculpture of dense concentric lines and irregular growth stops or wrinkles. Hinge plate prominent dominated by a long nymph supporting a very large external ligament; ligament rises well above the dorsal margin of the shell and extends posteriorly beyond the nymph to fill the escutcheon. Hinge teeth complex; RV with a single prominent anterior lateral tooth situated in front of the beak in the form of a narrow projecting peg with a flat or slightly excavated dorsal surface; below the beak is an arched laminar tooth its anterior end overlapping the lateral tooth, its posterior slopes steeply and ventrally and merges with a second ridge only noticeable by a weak notch mid way on this combined ridge. LV with a thin laminar posterior cardinal angled obliquely plus two combined cardinals in a horizontal orientation the posterior part larger than the anterior with a distinct notch between the two parts. Pallial line entire with a very small straightened section below the posterior adductor scar; adductor scars of about equal size; anterior pedal retractor scar deeply impressed, situated immediately in front of the hinge plate. Periostracum thin, persistent, glossy. Shell white. Mantle thin, mantle edge unfused except for short inhalant and exhalant siphonal apertures; inhalant aperture with many papillae increasing in size dorsally, exhalant with papillae of equal size. Foot with a distinct finger-like toe and poorly developed heel, pedal retractors prominent, the anterior attached in a deep impression close to the hinge. Anterior adductor muscle oval in cross-section, posterior adductor muscle subcircular, smaller than the anterior one. Ctenidia of a large, single (inner) demibranch, ascending part approximately one half the height of the outer, filaments fine tightly connected. Etymology. megadesmus from the Greek mega meaning large and desma meaning bond; referring to the external ligament. Remarks. The taxonomy of Isorropodon in the Atlantic and Mediterranean is complex and potentially confused Salas 2001, Cosel and Olu 2009 ). Cosel and Salas (2001) described two new species from the Eastern Atlantic, namely I. bigoti and I. curtum. They transferred a third from Kelliella, namely I. elongatum (Allen 2001) . In discussing, the Mediterranean, I. perplexum Cosel and Salas (2001) stated that Isorropodon species are variable with regard to outline, tumidity and development of hinge teeth and this is illustrated in their figures 36-47 for I. perplexum. They noted similarities in shell morphology between the Eastern Mediterranean species I. perplexum and the West African I. bigoti but suggested that these taxa were isolated geographically and doubtfully could have gene flow between them. They further supported this argument by stating that I. perplexum had not been found in the Western Mediterranean or Ibero-Moroccan Gulf. In 2009, Cosel and Olu described another Isorropodon from West Africa (I. atalantae) and placed another vesicomyid in this genus (I. striatum Thiele and Jaeckel 1931) . Therefore, before the discovery of Isorropodon in the Gulf of Cadiz there were already five west African species and one from the eastern Mediterranean. With the discovery of Isorropodon at the Capt. Arutyunov MV the assertion made by Cosel and Salas (2001) on genetic isolation can be questioned, as there is the possibility of gene flow between the seeps in the Mediterranean and around the east African coast. In contrast to the variability given by Cosel and Salas (2001) for I. perplexum, all of the shells from station 218 examined here are constant with regard to features of outline, tumidity and hinge teeth. However, a single shell from station 180 is distinct, being inflated, having a distinct lunule, having a much smaller ligament and in the ventral margin being more convex. The shells from station 218 are distinct from all the shells of I. perplexum figured by Cosel and Salas (2001) in having a much longer nymph with the posterior teeth reaching only about one third of the ligament as opposed to the half distance given for I. perplexum by Cosel and Salas (2001) . Furthermore, most of the shells illustrated by them have a more convex ventral margin than the shells from station 218. The single shell from station 180 shares more features with the Mediterranean shells in having the small ligament, convex ventral margin and being more inflated. The outline of I. bigoti differs from all of the above in the narrower anterior and distinct angulation of the ventral curve, but is has a short nymph similar to I. perplexum and the shell from station 180. Isorropodon atalantae has a more sunken lunule and more angular posterior profile than either of the Gulf of Cadiz taxa. Isorropodon curtum Cosel and Salas, 2001 , from off Mauritania, is more circular in outline and I striatum Thiele and Jaeckel, 1931 from off Angola, is a much larger and more elongate form. Cosel and Salas (2001) reassigned Kelliella elongata Allen, 2001 to the genus Isorropodon. Following examination of the type material in the Natural History Museum, London (BMNH 1998180) we conclude that it is not conspecific with any of the taxa discussed here. It is a small species not exceeding 2mm in any of the over 300 specimens listed by Allen (2001) . It is inflated with a distinct lunule but the demarcating line illustrated by Allen (2001) is not so apparent. The hinge of the right valve has three distinct teeth including a small posterior tooth (4b in Allen 2001), which is not present in either of the species from the Cadiz mud volcanoes. Furthermore, the ligament is small and does not project as in I. megadesmus. From the ctenidial anatomy there is no indication that this species is chemosymbiotic. In addition to the morphological differences, I. elongatum has been collected from a wide geographical range, wide bathymetric range and associated with the typical oligotrophic deep-sea bivalve assemblage (derived from Allen 2008) . It would appear that I. elongatum, if a chemosymbiotic species is not confined to seep/vent settings but as stated by Allen (2001) it is absent from the European basin and it was not present in the samples taken in the Gulf of Cadiz away from the vicinity of the mud volcanoes (Rodrigues 2009 ). Figs 10A-B, 11 Material examined. One complete specimen, live collected, MSM01.03, stn 180, deep-water field, Captain Arutyunov MV. 35°39.740'N, 07°19.960'W, 1323m, 27 April 2006 , NMWZ.2010 Measurements. 6.4mm (L) × 5.3mm (H) × 3.6mm (T) Description ( Figs 10A-B, 11 ). 6.4 mm in length. Thin. Equivalve. Inequilateral, beaks in front of the midline. Inflated, length to tumidity ratio = 1.8. Outline subovate, anterior bluntly rounded, posterior a little obliquely truncated; ventral curvature at its maximum more or less at the midline. Lunule indistinct, slightly depressed. Es- cutcheon narrow, deeply excavated. Sculpture of dense, concentric, fine lines and few irregular growth stops. Hinge plate narrow, nymph supporting an external ligament; ligament scarcely rises above the dorsal margin of the shell and extends posteriorly to half the length of the escutcheon. Hinge teeth complex; RV with a single prominent anterior lateral tooth situated in front of the beak in the form of a narrow projecting peg with a flat or slightly excavated dorsal surface; below the beak is weakly arched laminar tooth its anterior end overlapping the lateral tooth, its posterior slopes steeply and ventrally and merges with a second ridge only noticeable by a weak notch mid way on this combined ridge. LV with a thin laminar posterior cardinal angled obliquely plus two combined cardinals in a horizontal orientation the posterior part only slightly larger than the anterior with a distinct notch between the two parts. Pallial line entire with a very small straightened section below the posterior adductor scar; adductor scars of about equal size; anterior pedal retractor scar deeply impressed, situated immediately in front of the hinge plate. Periostracum thin, persistent, glossy. Shell white Mantle thin, mantle edge unfused except for short inhalant and exhalant siphonal apertures; inhalant aperture with few papillae increasing in size dorsally, the latter as short tentacles, exhalant with papillae of equal size. Foot with a blunt finger-like toe and poorly developed heel, pedal retractors prominent, the anterior attached in a deep impression close to the hinge. Anterior adductor muscle pyriform in cross-section, posterior adductor muscle subcircular, smaller than the anterior one. Ctenidia of a large, single (inner) demibranch, filling the majority of the mantle cavity, ascending part approximately one half the height of the outer, filaments fine tightly connected. The numerous crystalline growths seen on and between the filaments are believed to be natural and not an artifact of preservation. Distribution. Isorropodon sp indet is restricted to Captain Arutyunov MV (1323m). Remarks. As discussed above for I. megadesmus. Symbiosis. Twelve bivalve species have been found in close association with chemosynthetic settings in the Gulf of Cadiz (this paper; Génio et al. 2008 , Rodrigues et al. 2008 ) with a thirteenth, Callogonia cyrili Cosel and Salas probable but not proven (Cosel and Salas 2001) . The trophic status of these Solemyidae, Lucinidae, Thyasiridae and Vesicomyidae species has been confirmed by their gross anatomical features (e.g. gills for thyasirids, reduced gut for solemyids) and, in some cases, also by stable isotope analysis and/or molecular analysis . The δ 13 C values for solemyids (Acharax gadirae, Solemya (Petrasma) elarraichensis), lucinid (Lucinoma asapheus) and thyasirid (Thyasira vulcolutre) bivalves were found to be in line with data for other bivalves known to host thiotrophic symbionts (Fisher 1990 , Carlier et al. 2010 (Oliver and Holmes 2006b) . Distribution patterns. The Gulf of Cadiz mud volcano field is comprised of over thirty seeps of various activity and spread over a bathymetric range of 200-4000m. Of the 25 mud volcanoes sampled, 13 have chemosymbiotic species, which indicates their importance in the structure of the seep assemblages (Fig. 1) . Most of the thirteen, chemosymbiotic, species found in the Gulf of Cadiz are restricted to one or two mud volcanoes. This patchy distribution can result from physical or physiological constraints such as depth, distance and fluid flow rates. They were more frequent in the shallower mud volcanoes (200-1500m) but were especially diverse in Captain Arutyunov MV where five different species co-occur (Fig. 1) . Some taxa are confined to single mud volcanoes whereas others are more widespread. The family most frequently encountered in the chemosynthesis-based assemblages of the mud volcanoes from the Gulf of Cadiz, is the Solemyidae. The family is represented by two genera, Solemya (Petrasma) with a shallower distribution (358-1030m) and Acharax with a deeper distribution (556-3902m) but co-occurring at intermediate depths in the Western Moroccan field. Co-occurrence of these genera has not been reported elsewhere and may be explained by the apparent absence of the subgenus Petrasma from seep settings preferring reducing sediments and low oxygen conditions (Kamenev 2009 ). This is the first record of this family in cold seeps from the North-east Atlantic, although Solemya (Solemya) togata is well known from shallow settings such as sea-grass beds in the Mediterranean. Why this species has not or been unable to colonize the shallow mud volcanoes is unknown. In contrast, the Pacific Solemya (S.) tagiri Okutani et al. (2003) is thought to be associated with seep settings (Kamenev 2009 ) suggesting that habitat is not linked to phylogeny. Unlike Solemya (Petrasma), Acharax species are consistently associated with seep or vent settings and some species such as the Pacific A. johnsoni have extensive bathymetric ranges from 100 to over 5000m (Kamenev 2009) . Acharax species are all rather morphologically similar and given the molecular data given by Neulinger et al. (2006) it may be found that there are more species than currently recognized. This is suggested here by the morphological differences in the posterior aperture between the shallow and deeper specimens. Some Acharax specimens (from Yuma, Ginsburg and Jesus Baraza MVs) host commensal polychaetes (Ravara et al. 2007) . In contrast to the solemyids, the lucinid Lucinoma asapheus has only been collected at Mercator MV, although video observations revealed presence of lucinids in other mud volcanoes from the Spanish field (MR Cunha, pers. comm.). Lucinoma asapheus is very similar morphologically to Lucinoma kazani from the Eastern Mediterranean (Salas and Woodside 2002) and both are almost identical with the widespread shelf species Lucinoma borealis that is abundant in the North-east Atlantic. Our preliminary molecular data separated Lucinoma borealis from L. asapheus, and further work on L. kazani confirms that it is also distinct from L. borealis (J Taylor, pers comm.) . A more detailed study including a wider data set from L. asapheus should elucidate the relationship between it and L. kazani. The three species so far mentioned are similar but quite distinct from the much larger, deeper water SE Atlantic species such as L. myriamae and L. saldanhae and the Indo-Pacific species, L. gagei and L. yoshidai (Oliver and Holmes 2006a) . It is therefore plausible that L. asapheus, L. kazani and L. borealis are a clade, but we cannot ascertain their sequence of appearance. Are the mud volcano species independently evolved from shallow water ancestors or are they descended from a common seep dwelling stock? The thyasirid Thyasira vulcolutre was only found in the deep-water mud volcano field (Rodrigues et al. 2008) . Despite the high number of thyasirid species present in the Gulf of Cadiz (eight) only one Thyasira vulcolutre is strictly associated with active mud volcanoes (Rodrigues et al. 2008) . Spinaxinus sentosus has been discovered in the organic cargo of a sunken ship in the Atlantic Ocean (Oliver and Holmes 2006b ) and is reported here for the first time associated to a cold seep site. Other chemosymbiotic thyasirids (Table 1) were found associated with Siboglinidae fields from the HakonMoseby MV (Gebruk et al. 2003) and from the eastern Mediterranean mud volcanoes (Olu-Le Roy et al. 2004) . Small vesicomyids including Isorropodon megadesmus and Isorropodon sp. were very abundant in Captain Arutyunov MV. The species I. perplexum is known only from the Eastern Mediterranean (Table 1) , and was shown to harbour sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (Salas and Woodside 2002) . During TTR17 (2008) a living specimen of Calyptogena was found for the first time in the Gulf of Cadiz. The specimen collected from Bonjardim has been identified as belonging to the species Christineconcha regab Cosel and Olu, 2009 , recently found in the Regab region (E Krylova, pers. comm.) . Other large vesicomyid shells but no living specimens of Laubiericoncha chuni (Thiele and Jaeckel 1931) and Pliocardia sp. were also collected at the same mud volcano. The vesicomyids C. regab and L. chuni dominate the faunal assemblages of Congo and Angola Basin cold seeps (Olu-Le Roy et al. 2007, Cosel and Olu 2008 ). Bathymodioline mussels of the amphi-Atlantic species Bathymodiolus mauritanicus were only found living in Darwin MV although extensive graveyards of mussel shell ash are also found in other mud volcanoes of the western Moroccan field (Génio et al. 2008) . Although confirmed as chemosymbiotic, Bathymodiolus mauritanicus was first collected during a commercial trawl in the Mauritanian margin where no hydrocarbon seeps have yet been discovered. Nevertheless owing to the repeated appearance of other typical seep molluscs it is likely the existence of seepage in this region might be confirmed in the future (Cosel 2002) . Another small mytilid Idas sp. was collected living in a small wood fall retrieved by the ROV Isis at Carlos Ribeiro MV during JC10. Idas specimens are present in the mud volcanoes from the Eastern Mediterranean (Table 1) and their symbioses have been studied in detail by Duperron et al. (2008) . When discussing Isorropodon, Cosel and Salas (2001) suggested that Mediterranean and SE Atlantic forms were unlikely to be the same species due to their geographic isolation. With the discovery of Isorropodon in the Gulf of Cadiz, this argument can be challenged. Here we review the distributions of all chemosymbiotic taxa found at seeps in the Eastern Atlantic/Eastern Mediterranean and consider the apparent levels of endemism. Table 1 presents the known taxa and their occurrence in the four major seep fields, namely Eastern Mediterranean, Gulf of Cadiz, off Mauritania and the Gulf of Guinea. The Gulfs of Cadiz and Guinea are most diverse and almost equally so with 13 and 14 species respectively. The less sampled Mauritania basin has only 7 recorded species while the well studied Eastern Mediterranean has only 6 species. The number of species common to more than two fields is zero and the maximum number of shared species is two, that for the Gulfs of Cadiz and Guinea. These data suggest high levels of endemism within fields but where there is overlap, especially with the larger vesicomyids, that this occurs at deeper sites. The vesicomyids are the most diverse family but only one species has colonized the Eastern Mediterranean and they appear to be rare in the Gulf of Cadiz compared with the Gulf of Guinea. From a geological history perspective one can explain the poor diversity in the Eastern Mediterranean from the shorter period of time for colonization since the re-invasion of Atlantic waters post the hypersaline event. At this time there is no evidence to indicate the origins of the Eastern Atlantic faunas, either by dispersal or local speciation. Molecular data from the species rich genus Isorropodon may illuminate the relationships and sequence of speciation and we await the study in progress on the Vesicomyidae mentioned by Cosel and Olu (2008) . Warén and Bouchet (2009) in discussing seep gastropods stated that the West African fauna was quite distinct from that of the Gulf of Cadiz at both species and generic levels and suggested that the latter was of more recent origin via local radiation. At the generic level, these findings appear at odds with the bivalve data where there are strong similarities between the Gulfs of Guinea and Cadiz. The exceptions are Solemya (Petrasma), which appears to have a NW Atlantic origin and Lucinoma species, where their origin may be local. Warén and Bouchet (2009) further indicated strong affinities of the West African fauna with the Western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico faunas. Relationships among the bivalves with the western Atlantic at the species level are few, if any; only with Bathymodiolus mauritanicus is there a suggestion of an amphi-Atlantic distribution (Génio et al. 2008) . At the generic level there is considerable over-lap within the solemyids, lucinids and thyasirids but less so with the vesicomyids. This may be in part to the considerable number of new genera erected for eastern Atlantic taxa by Olu (2008, 2009 ).",Graham Olive,2011,21976991,10.3897/zookeys.113.1402
14982203,Use of 16S rRNA Gene Based Clone Libraries to Assess Microbial Communities Potentially Involved in Anaerobic Methane Oxidation in a Mediterranean Cold Seep,"This study provides data on the diversities of bacterial and archaeal communities in an active methane seep at the Kazan mud volcano in the deep Eastern Mediterranean sea. Layers of varying depths in the Kazan sediments were investigated in terms of (1) chemical parameters and (2) DNA-based microbial population structures. The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of directly amplified 16S rRNA genes, resulting in the phylogenetic analysis of the prokaryotic communities. Sequences of organisms potentially associated with processes such as anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction were thus identified. Overall, the sediment layers revealed the presence of sequences of quite diverse bacterial and archaeal communities, which varied considerably with depth. Dominant types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms involved in the following processes: (1) anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction, (2) sulfide oxidation, and (3) a range of (aerobic) heterotrophic processes. In the communities in the lowest sediment layer sampled (22-34 cm), sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea of the ANME-2 cluster (likely involved in anaerobic methane oxidation) were prevalent, whereas heterotrophic organisms abounded in the top sediment layer (0-6 cm). Communities in the middle layer (6-22 cm) contained organisms that could be linked to either of the aforementioned processes. We discuss how these phylogeny (sequence)-based findings can support the ongoing molecular work aimed at unraveling both the functioning and the functional diversities of the communities under study.","In the past decade, domelike structures called Bmud volcanoes^have been discovered in several deep-sea sites, including the Mediterranean Sea [32] . Mud volcanoes emit large quantities of methane (an important greeenhouse gas) and hydrogen sulfide, yielding marine sediment environments-also called cold seeps-that can be highly enriched in these compounds [7, 35] . For instance, the Kazan mud volcano sediment is known to be rich in methane and to contain reduced as well as oxidized forms of sulfur [54] . Life at such mud volcanoes (cold seeps) is probably largely sustained by primary producers that use methane and hydrogen sulfide as energy sources. This is reminiscent of hydrothermal vents [8, 19] , where life is primarily sustained by the microbial oxidation of sulfide [3, 27, 47] . Stable carbon isotope measurements of cold seep sediments and carbonate crusts have indicated that the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), rather than of sulfide, is the basis of chemoautotrophy in these deep-sea ecosystems [1, 44] . Specific methanotrophic archaeal groups, denominated ANME-1 and ANME-2, have been implicated as the main constituents of the microbial communities involved in AOM [6, 40, 49] . These organisms are either distantly (ANME-1) or closely (ANME-2) related to the (methanogenic) Methanosarcinales group. However, AOM by other archaea, e.g., the novel ANME-3 group, cannot been excluded [20, 30] . The ANME-1 and ANME-2 group archaea consume methane in a close relationship with sulfate-reducing bacteria [5, 6, 37] . To date, these organisms have not been obtained in pure culture, and hence molecular approaches are indicated to assess their diversity, prevalence, and potential function. The occurrence of AOM in the sediments of the Kazan mud volcano has been indicated [54] by data on membrane lipids of the local microbial communities, but DNA-based studies have not yet been performed. In this work we analyze the diversity and nature of the bacterial and archaeal communities present in different Kazan sediment layers by using direct DNA-based molecular analyses. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was employed as a marker for diversity. The microbial community structures found are evaluated against the chemical background of the system, in order to estimate the functional dominance of microbial AOM in the sediment layers. From this analysis, the validity of inferring ecosystem function purely from clonal phylogeny will be discussed and possible avenues toward a more sound, ecogenomics-based approach will be put forward.  Box cores were taken from a depth of 1673 m at the summit of the Kazan mud volcano (35-25.9 0 N, 30-33.7 0 E) during the 1999 MEDINETH scientific cruise of the R/V Professor Logachev. Subsamples of one box core, BC19, were then taken, using sterilized aluminum corers. Based on sediment color, the core was divided in three depth layers for DNA extraction and molecular analyses: top-from 0 (surface) to 6 cm depth (browngray sediment, Kazan-1); middle-from 6 to 22 cm (grayish-black sediment, Kazan-2); bottom-from 22 to 34 cm (dark black to gray sediment, Kazan-3). Subsamples (1 mL) were aseptically taken from these layers by using sterile 1-mL syringes. For each layer, eight subsamples were pooled in 12-mL sterile Greiner tubes, after which these were sealed, immediately frozen at -80-C, and kept frozen upon analysis. Subsamples from different sediment depths were centrifuged (0-C) at 16.000 Â g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected with a 50-mL syringe, filtered over a 0.2-mm membrane filter into new sterile Greiner tubes and the filtrates stored on ice. For determination of the levels of total dissolved organic carbon (TDOC), NO , and Cl -, subsamples were taken and stored at -20-C. Subsamples (2 mL) for sulfide measurements were treated with 10 mL ultrapure 1 M NaOH per mL, and sulfide levels were determined according to standard procedures [54] ; however, the sulfide determinations should be interpreted as rough estimates in the light of the known caveats of such determinations in natural samples. Subsamples (2 mL) for PO 4 3-measurements were treated with 10 mL ultrapure 1 M HCl per mL and stored at 4-C. The pelleted material from each sediment layer (10-15 g) was oven-dried (60-C, 36 h) for subsequent analyses. The NO , and Cl -concentrations were determined by ion chromatography (Dionex DX-120 IC; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). TDOC was measured on a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-5050A, Shimadzu Benelux, Den Bosch, Netherlands). Water chemistry measurements were carried out in duplicate on the same water sample. The data were compared to data previously obtained by Haese and co-workers [22] . Extraction of Sediment Microbial Community DNA. The pooled samples from each depth layer were used to extract total microbial community DNA by using a modified DNA extraction protocol. Briefly, each sample was homogenized, after which 5 g (wet weight) was divided over 2-mL screw-cap tubes containing 0.5 g of a 1:1 mixture of zirconium and glass beads (diameter 0.1 mm). The mixtures were heated in a water bath at 70-C for 15 min and then put on ice. Tris buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH = 9.0; 150 mL) and lysozyme solution (50 mL; 20 mg mL -1 ) were added to each tube, and samples treated in a minibead beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA) at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. The tubes were then horizontally shaken (1 h, 37-C, 150 rpm), after which sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/proteinase K (final concentration: 0.8% SDS, 10 U mL -1 proteinase K) was added and the tubes were shaken (50-C, 30 min, 150 rpm) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 Â g. Subsequently, the supernatant was collected and kept on ice. The pellet was then reextracted by the addition of 350 mL EDTA/Tris buffer (0.5 M EDTA; 0.2 M Tris-HCl; pH 8.0) and 20 mL SDS (25%) and heating (70-C, 5 min), and bead beating (14,000 rpm for 30 s). This procedure was repeated. After 1 h incubation at 70-C with continuous shaking (200 rpm), the samples were centrifuged (4 min, 16,000 Â g). The EDTA/Tris extraction was repeated once more and then 400 mL phosphate buffer (90 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ; 5.5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ; pH = 8.0) was added to the tubes containing the sediment/beads pellet. Samples were heated at 70-C for 5 min, treated in a minibead beater (14,000 rpm, 30 s), and incubated (30 min, 70-C) before the supernatant was collected. This procedure was repeated once. Supernatants from the same sediment section were pooled in a sterile 40-mL tube and extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (50:49:1), and once with an equal volume of chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol (24:1). After addition of 2 vol of 100% ethanol and 0.1 vol of sodium acetate (3 M, pH = 5.2) to the aqueous phase, DNA was precipitated overnight at -20-C. The DNA pellets were washed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 1.0 mL HPLC-grade water. DNA was then cleaned by using a WIZARD DNA cleanup kit (Promega Benelux, Leiden, the Netherlands) followed by a Quick Spini column (Roche Nederland, Woerden, the Netherlands). Finally, DNA was concentrated to a volume of 100 mL. DNA concentrations were measured by using a Genequant II spectrophotometer (Pharmacia, Groningen, the Netherlands). PCR Amplification, Cloning, and Sequencing. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified using primers specific for bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified by using the B8F (5 0 -AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3 0 ) forward primer [15] and the universal U1406R (5 0 -ACGGGCGGTG TGTRC-3 0 ) reverse primer [31] . Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified with the A2F (5 0 -TTCCGGTTGA TCCYGCCGGA-3 0 ) forward primer [13] in combination with the universal U1406R (5 0 -ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3 0 ) reverse primer. In cases where the total amounts of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product were low, the reaction was repeated with the same forward primer in combination with the A958-R reverse primer (5 0 -YCCGGCGTTGAMTCCAATT-3 0 ) [13] . PCR mixtures (25 mL) contained 10.2 mM Tris buffer, 2.3 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl, 2% DMSO, 5 mg BSA, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.2 mM of each primer, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed in a PerkinElmer GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJsel, the Netherlands) using the following program: 95-C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94-C for 1 min, 57.5-C for 30 s, 72-C for 4 min, with a final elongation step of 72-C for 7 min. PCR products were purified using QIAquick spin columns (Invitrogen, Groningen, the Netherlands) and subsequently cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega Benelux) using Escherichia coli JM109 as the host. Inserts were amplified by colony PCR, using the pGEM-T specific primers T7 (5 0 -TAATACGACTCACTA TAGGG-3 0 ) and SP6 (5 0 -GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3 0 ). PCR mixtures were as described above, and amplification used the following PCR conditions: 94-C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94-C for 1 min, 48-C for 30 s, 72-C for 4 min, with a final elongation step of 72-C for 7 min. At least 50 clones with inserts of the expected length were selected from each library and partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined using Big Dye version 3 cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA) and an ABI3100 PRISM Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions used B8F, T7, or U515 (5 0 -GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3 0 ) forward primers for bacteria, and A2F, T7, or U515 forward primers for archaea. Partial sequences were manually edited in BChromas 1.45^( http://www.technelysium. com.au) and contig assemblies were done in BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) according to the procedure described by Huang [24] . This yielded a majority of sequences of õ1000 to 1300 bp. Chimeric sequences were detected by using the CHECK_CHIMERA utility at the Ribosomal Database Project and removed from the analyses. Nearest relatives of the remaining sequences were obtained from the Genbank database by using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at the NCBI website. Sequences representing distinct phylotypes (as the criterion, 97% sequence similarity was used) and their closest relatives were aligned by using the fast aligner utility of the ARB software package [33] . Alignments were checked manually, using the secondary structure of the 16S rRNA molecule. Evolutionary distances were calculated according to the Kimura [28] two-parameter correction method, after which neighbor joining trees were constructed with 1000 bootstrap samplings using TreeconW [52] . 16S rRNA gene sequences showing 97% similarity or higher were considered to belong to the same phylotype. Related 16S rRNA gene sequences were placed within tentative taxa (between Phylum and Order) by determining the taxonomic class (using the NCBI taxonomy database) of the closest relative in GenBank of sequences that formed a phylogenetic clade. Sequences that showed no or low (below 70%) relatedness with known bacterial or archaeal phylogenetic groups were listed as unclassified. Shannon-Weaver indices of diversity were calculated for all communities on the basis of the phylotype distribution using the PAST program (http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/ past/). The similarity between sediment layers at the level of phylotypes and phylogenetic groups was determined by using the Morisita-Horn index of similarity [56] . The 16S rRNA gene sequences determined in this study were deposited in Genbank under accession numbers AY591932-AY592229.  Upon opening of the cores containing the Kazan mud volcano sediment samples, a strong sulfide smell was noticed. Furthermore, strong degassing was apparent, as deeper layers had a Bmousse^- like appearance. These observations indicated that the sediment was derived from an active methane seep, an observation that was supported by onboard methane measurements [54] . Analysis of the chemical parameters of the sediments (Table 1) showed the presence of nitrate in the top (Kazan-1) and middle (Kazan-2) layers. Sulfide was not detected in Kazan-1, but increased in concentration in the deeper layers, with the highest concentrations in Kazan-2. Sulfate concentrations were highest in the top layers, and, in gross terms, decreased with depth. Overall methane concentrations increased with depth; however, gas hydrate destabilization and degassing affected these measurements. Concentrations up to 60 mM methane were estimated to occur in the deepest sediment layer using model calculations [22] . TDOC values were roughly similar between the sediment layers studied. Overall, the Kazan sediment thus showed clear stratification in chemical terms, with conditions propitious for anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction prevailing in the middle and deepest layers. The DNA extracted from the sediment samples showed yields of 13.2, 20.4, and 16.4 ng per g of Kazan-1, Kazan-2, and Kazan-3 sediment. The DNA was readily amplifiable by direct 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR, indicating its purity. Clone libraries of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were constructed for the Kazan-1, Kazan-2, and Kazan-3 layers. In total, 137 bacterial and 147 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were thus obtained, encompassing approximately 45 bacterial and 50 archaeal sequences from each sediment layer. Rarefaction analysis of the distribution of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes in the clone libraries yielded asymptotic accumulation curves, indicating that the clone libraries represented abundant (dominant) members of the microbial communities. For the bacterial clone libraries, coverage values were 13% (Kazan-1), 24% (Kazan-2), and 55% (Kazan-3), and for the archaeal ones, 85% (Kazan-1), 54% (Kazan-2), and 76% (Kazan-3). This indicated a high total bacterial diversity that was only partially represented by the clone libraries constructed, versus a better-covered archaeal diversity. Archaeal Diversity. Overall, the archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences represented 38 phylotypes, which fell into six phylogenetic groups ( Table 2, Fig. 1A ). All six groups belonged to the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, the two major groups in the domain Archaea. Sediment layers Kazan-1 and Kazan-2 shared only one phylotype (affiliated with Marine Group I archaea), whereas Kazan-2 and Kazan-3 shared two phylotypes (see the sequences underlined in Table 2 ). Thus, substantial differences existed in the archaeal community structures between the Fig. 1A) . In Kazan-1, sequences affiliated with the Marine Group Irelated archaea were most abundant, whereas those of novel Crenarchaea and Methanosarcinales-related archaea were most abundant in Kazan-2. In Kazan-3, sequences of Methanosarcinales-related archaea were most frequent (see Fig. 1A ). Bacterial Diversity. Overall, the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences included 91 phylotypes that comprised 13 phylogenetic groups (Table 2 , Fig. 1B) . At the phylotype level, bacterial sequences sampled were unique per layer, as no shared phylotypes were observed between layers. At the level of phylogenetic groups, we found several overlaps between layers, as shown in Table 2 . In particular, sequences reflecting the presence of Planctomycetacia were prevalent in all layers. The majority of bacterial sequences in Kazan-1 were classified as Actinobacteria, whereas Chloroflexi-like sequences were most abundant in Kazan-2 and those related to Chloroflexi and dProteobacteria in Kazan-3. Similarity and Diversity Indices. Morisita-Horn indices of similarity were calculated to estimate the similarities of the bacterial and archaeal communities between the sediment layers (Table 3) . At the level of phylotypes, the similarities for both communities in the three sediment layers were found to be low, which indicates that each layer contained a microbial community of distinct structure. When the similarity values were calculated at the level of phylogenetic groups, these were found to be higher, i.e., up to 0.71 (Table 3) . This indicated that, although each layer still showed a distinct community structure, there was a higher level of phylogenetic group Boverlap^between the three layers. The highest similarities occurred between adjacent layers, whereas the nonadjacent layers Kazan-1 and Kazan-3 showed the lowest similarities. Diversities in the microbial communities in the different sediment layers were assessed by using the Shannon diversity index. For the bacterial communities, the values obtained (Table 4) were high for all layers, showing a decrease from top (Kazan-1) to bottom (Kazan-3), from 3.6 to 2.5, respectively. The diversity index for the archaeal communities ranged between 1.6 and 2.6 (Table 4) , with low values in Kazan-1 and Kazan-3 and higher one in Kazan-2. Grouping of Sequences and Link to Potential Function. Phylogenetic trees of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained in this study and those of the nearest relatives from Genbank were constructed to assess their phylogenetic relatedness (Figs. 2 and 3 -only the most abundant bacterial sequences are included). Most archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences did not show high similarity (997%) with sequences in the database (including sequences from cultivated species and environmental clones), indicating the likelihood that the main fraction of the prokaryotic community sampled was composed of novel organisms. The majority of the Kazan-1 archaeal sequences clustered within the Marine Group I Crenarchaeota (Figs. 1A and 2 ), which encompass heterotrophic as well as autotrophic organisms [14, 41, 57] . The other archaeal 16S rRNA sequences in Kazan-1 were related to sequences of the halophilic Halobacteriales (Figs. 1A and 2), cultured representatives of which include chemoorganotrophs capable of using amino acids or carbohydrates as carbon sources [38] . The bacterial sequences found in the Kazan-1 layer were related to Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetacia (Figs. 1B  and 3 ), groups that include aerobic chemotrophs as well as aerobic and facultatively anaerobic heterotrophs [2, 18, 25] . In addition, sequences related to those of the g-Proteobacterial sulfide-oxidizing bacteria such as Beggiatoa and Thiobacillus were present in this layer (Figs. 1B and 3) . Figure 2 . Phylogenetic tree of archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences in deep-sea sediment samples from three depth layers in sediment at the Kazan mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean: Kazan-1 (0-6 cm), Kazan-2 (6-22 cm), and Kazan-3 (22-34 cm). The tree was constructed by using sequences longer than 800 bp, and neighborjoining analysis using 1000 bootstrap replicates was used to infer the topology. Phylogenetic groups detected are indicated in brackets. The bar represents 5% sequence divergence. A large fraction (33%) of the archaeal sequences in Kazan-2 was related to methanogenic Methanosarcinales (Figs. 1A and 2 ). In fact, most of these sequences were closely related to those of the ANME-2 group, which has been implicated in AOM [23, 40] . Another large fraction of the archaeal sequences reflected the presence of Crenarchaeota with unknown metabolic properties (Figs. 1A and 2) . Sequences of these Crenarchaeota have been previously obtained from deepsea sediments [34, 49] . The majority of the bacterial sequences in Kazan-2 were related to those representative of Chloroflexi (Figs. 1B and 3) , a metabolically versatile group of bacteria found in many environments [4] . In addition, the high frequency of the (heterotrophic) Actinobacteria-related sequences indicated that these bacteria were abundant in Kazan-2 (Figs. 1B and 3 ). Sequences affiliated with those of different a-Proteobacteria, notably the methylotrophic Hyphomicrobium and Methylobacterium species, were also detected, as were gProteobacterial sequences that clustered with those of the sulfide oxidizers Beggiatoa and Thiobacillus (data not in tree). Hence, organisms involved in C 1 metabolism [12] and sulfide-based chemoautotrophy were indicated in Kazan-2; however, final proof of this concept should come from additional work using advanced methods such as activity-based (meta)genomics approaches. Interestingly, the finding of a d-Proteobacteria-related sequence, closely related to those of known sulfate-reducing bacteria (Fig. 1B , not in Fig. 3 ), indicated potential sulfate reduction. Most archaeal sequences in Kazan-3 were closely related to those of the ANME-2 group Methanosarcinales (Figs. 1A and 2 ). These sequences comprised at least three distinct groups, which clustered with the ANME-2 group related sequences of Kazan-2 (Fig. 2) . As to the Kazan-3 bacterial community, 50% of the sequences clustered within those of the d subclass of the Proteobacteria (Figs. 1B and 3) , specifically with those of Desulfobacteriaceae (sulfate reducers) as well as other sequences from (1) environments propitious for AOM and (2) hydrocarbon-containing deep-sea sediments [29, 39] . The remaining bacterial sequences from Kazan-3 were related to those of Chloroflexi. Overall, the chemistry and microbial community data indicated that the three sediment layers analyzed differed with respect to (1) the chemical environment, and (2) the relative dominance of specific types in the archaeal and bacterial populations, as a refection of prevailing community processes. When the chemical, the lipid biomarker [54] , microscopic observations [54] (A. Boetius, pers. comm.), and the phylogeny-based data indicative of function were compared (Table 5) , great consistency regarding AOM and sulfate reduction was observed between the three datasets [22, 54] . In Kazan-1, the most abundant 16S rRNA gene sequences were related to those of-next to aerobic/facultatively anaerobic heterotrophs-autotrophs involved in sulfide or methane oxidation [14, 25, 41, 57] . The occurrence of these processes was supported by the 22-34 cm) . The tree was constructed by using sequences longer than 800 bp, and neighborjoining analysis using 1000 bootstrap replicates was used to infer the topology. Phylogenetic groups detected are indicated in brackets. The bar represents 5% sequence divergence. No data indicating that this process occurred; T: weak evidence indicating that this process occurred; +: strong evidence indicating that this process occurred; ++: conclusive data indicating that this process occurred. a For 16S rDNA gene sequence data, -: no sequences; T: 1-2 sequences; +: 3-10 sequences; ++: 910 sequences related to organisms with known or likely metabolic properties inferred from phylogenetic affiliation. For lipid data, -: lipids indicative for specific group of organisms not found; T: lipids indicative for specific group found in low concentrations and/or carbon isotope values inconclusive; ++, lipids indicative for specific group found in high levels, with carbon isotope values supporting likely metabolic function (see Table 4 ). For chemistry data, AOM, -: no support from methane/sulfide and sulfate data; +: support from methane/sulfide and sulfate data (i.e., decrease of methane and increase of sulfide compared to adjacent layer, but sulfate data inconclusive); ++: strong support from methane/sulfide and sulfate data (i.e., decrease of methane and sulfate and increase of sulfide compared to adjacent layer). For anaerobic sulfate reduction, -: sulfate present in high levels, no sulfide detected; T: sulfate present in high levels, but sulfide detected in high levels; ++: sulfate present in low levels and sulfide detected. For aerobic sulfide oxidation, -: sulfide present, no nitrate/nitrite detected, likely anaerobic conditions; ++: sulfide absent or sulfide gradient found previously (57), combined with the presence of nitrate/nitrate. For heterotrophy, ++: presence of organic matter, combined with the presence of ammonium (see Table 4 ). chemistry and lipid data [54] (Tables 1 and 5 ). In Kazan-2, sequences reflecting (an)aerobic methane oxidizers, sulfide oxidizers, and sulfate reducers (1) were found, in addition to those of putative aerobes. The presence of such aerobes could indicate the occurrence of Bbioirrigation,t hought to occur down to õ10 cm [54] . Bioirrigation might bring down O 2 within tubes and burrows into the anoxic zone and, therefore, aerobic prokaryotes may occur at the sulfidic/methanogenic and oxic interfaces. Evidence for sulfide-and methane-based chemotrophy was, to some extent, provided by the chemistry data, and the lipid biomarker data reported aerobic methanotrophs (or methylotrophs) and sulfide oxidizers, with carbon isotope compositions indicative of chemotrophic processes [44, 55] . Taken together, the microbial community in Kazan-2 likely contained organisms involved in anaerobic chemotrophy. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of Kazan-3 reflected the occurrence of microorganisms involved in AOM and/or sulfate reduction. The chemical data, mainly the methane and sulfate depth profiles, supported these processes [22, 54] . Strong support for their occurrence was also obtained from the carbon isotope values of the specific biomarker lipids [54] . In addition, evidence for the occurrence of organisms potentially involved in (anaerobic) heterotrophic processes below a depth of 10 cm was also obtained. The presence of anoxic conditions at this depth was supported by the presence of sulfide, whereas an increase in the concentration of ammonium with depth (Table 1) We present a study based on directly obtained clone libraries of the microbial communities found at various sediment depths in the deep-sea cold seep Kazan. Much like other similar habitats [6, 23, 30, 36, 40, 51] , the Kazan sediment can be characterized by counterposed gradients of several chemical compounds, under methane and sulfate, as drivers of microbial community structures and processes [54] . We refer to this publication for an extensive description of the dynamics of mud volcano chemistry. Specifically, the porewater analysis for the Kazan sediments showed clear changes in the concentrations of ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, sulfide, and methane (Table 1) , similar to those found in previous studies in marine sediments [46] . The pH values measured may have been affected by degassing upon sample retrieval; the differential values indicate higher CO 2 levels in the lower layers. We surmised that, in microbial terms, the sediment actually represented a large conglomerate of niches that are determined by the interactions of the varying gradients over sediment length. Considering that all of the aforementioned chemical factors may drive the local microbial communities, it is difficult to ascertain which drivers are the most dominant. However, we hypothesized that the presence of the energy sources methane, sulfide, and (possibly) organic matter, in conjunction with that of the electron acceptors molecular oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate (and less oxidized forms of the latter two compounds), would be the primary drivers of the communities. Hence, we assessed (1) whether the microbial diversity per layer would actually report on the presence of such major driving forces, and (2) whether evidence for the presence of specific organisms potentially driven by a process such as AOM could be found. We will further bring forward a strategy to advance the phylogeny-based diversity versus function issue in this structured habitat. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data generated in this study provided an overall picture of clear heterogeneity between the communities in the different sediment layers. One of the possible caveats in such 16S rRNA sequence-based studies is undersampling, i.e., the recovery and analysis of simply too few sequences to adequately describe the microbial community in its major facets. Recent statistical studies that addressed this issue for soil are actually ominous, in that unrealistically high numbers of sequences seem to be required to adequately sample a soil community [10, 11] . It is obvious that the habitat sampled by our team, deep-sea sediment, differs from soil in the extent and nature of its microbial diversity, which were actually unknown at the onset of this study. Hence, any prior estimation of the number of sequences required to obtain reasonable coverage of the total diversity could not be sensibly made. On the basis of the clone number analysed, the data seem to tell us that, grossly speaking, only dominant members of the microbial communities in the different sediment layers were sampled. On this basis, a picture of complex communities that are definitely unique per layer (although the full extent of diversity is as yet invisible from the data obtained) emerges. However, within these-still fragmentary-data, we can clearly discern the confines of the functional capabilities of such communities. The main piece of evidence (Table 2 )-i.e., the finding that sequences related to those of ANME-2-type archaea and to d-proteobacterial sequences were abundant in Kazan-3 and to a lesser extent in Kazan-2-points in the direction of the AOM process taking place in these layers. This supports the conclusion that the local microbial communities dominated by ANME-2-type archaea and dproteobacterial sulfate reducers related to Desulfosarcina sp. are, to a large extent, driven by AOM. We tentatively link the lack of evidence for the presence of these organisms in Kazan-1 to them being less dominant in the light of the strong dominance of heterotrophs in this layer. This was consistent with the absence of sulfide from this layer. Other studies also indicated that the ANME-2 group archaea, next to those of ANME-1, are prominent parts of communities involved in AOM [6, 23, 40, 51] . On the other hand, the absence from, or low abundance of ANME-1 in, our samples was indicated by the absence of characteristic membrane lipids [53, 55] . A recent comparison between AOM communities from different Bmethane-rich^deep-sea areas also showed differences in dominance of ANME1 or ANME2 [30] . These areas showed chemical conditions favorable for AOM (i.e., sulfate and methane concentrations of up to 2 and 60 mM, respectively in the zone of AOM) and a relatively low diversity in archaeal ANME phylotypes, which is consistent with our findings. ANME-2-type archaea were also abundant in Kazan-2, and evidence for the occurrence of d-Proteobacteria capable of sulfate reduction was also found, albeit at low abundance. Direct microscopical observation of the sediment material revealed the presence of microbial aggregates that resemble those implicated in AOM [6] in these sediments (not shown, shown in an earlier work [54] ). The depth profiles of sulfate, sulfide, methane, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reflect the environmental conditions at the time of sampling, whereas by nature the microbial community data based on 16S rRNA gene sequences provide an integrated view of historical events [54] . Moreover, the data on salinity should also be interpreted in a similar manner. One could speculate that the differences observed between Kazan-1 and Kazan-2 on one hand, and Kazan-3 on the other, which might be indicative of recent gas hydrate dissolution, might have selected for specific microbial communities. However, direct evidence for this contention is lacking in this study. The sediment samples used in this study integrate depth intervals of 6, 16, and 12 cm, whereas the porewater chemical data had a resolution of 1 cm. As a consequence, the microbial communities as determined by the DNA analysis provide a more integrated view (and therefore less specific per smaller unit volume) than the porewater data. Lipid biomarker data were used as reference data that reflect functionally important microorganisms [54] . The summed concentrations of archaeol sn-3-hydroxyarchaeol and five unsaturated (PMI:x) compounds were used to indicate AOM archaea [53, 54] . Nonisoprenoidal dialkylethers were used as specific indicators of sulfate-reducing bacteria [42] . Isotopically depleted diploptene/diplopterol and bishomohopanol were used as lipids indicating aerobic methanotrophs or methylotrophs [16, 44] and aerobic sulfide-oxidizing prokaryotes [43, 54] , respectively. These lipids were set in relation to the amount of total lipids extracted from the sediment layers studied to illustrate the relative importance of the organisms presumably involved in the metabolic processes identified. The abundance of characteristic bacterial and archaeal membrane lipids in the top 30 cm of the sediments of the Kazan mud volcano are presented in Table 1 . Lipids assigned to archaea involved in AOM (i.e., archaeal, hydroxyarchaeol, and PMI:x) showed a strong increase in abundance with depth. A maximum abundance of this group was observed in Kazan-2. Previous studies showed strongly depleted d 13 C carbon isotopic values of these compounds, which were consistent with values for methane-derived carbon in AOM environments [54] . Lipids presumed to derive from aerobic methane oxidizing (or methylotrophic) bacteria were found in layers Kazan-1 and Kazan-2, with decreasing relative abundance downcore (Table 4) . b,bBishomohopanol, tentatively attributed to sulfide-oxidizing bacteria [55] , was most abundant in the top layer Kazan-1, but it was also present in layer Kazan-2. The carbon isotopic values of these compounds showed d C values between -46°and -53°, which is consistent with values for chemotrophic processes [54] . Most characteristic bacterial lipids identified in the three sediment layers were indicative for sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g., dialkyl ethers). These compounds were detected in the lowest sediment layers, be it that they were most abundant in Kazan-2. We are puzzled by the merely partial support for these organisms from the phylogeny-based data (Table 2) ; however, it is known that PCR-based detection of specific sequences from natural samples can be hampered. Nevertheless, their occurrence is likely, as previously reported carbon isotope measurements from the same sediment showed strongly negative d 13 C values of DIC and lipids derived from AOM archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria [22, 54] . Linking Phylogeny to Function-Caveats and Approaches. The high diversities and low similarities of the phylotypes in the microbial communities between the three Kazan sediment layers may reflect a range of different metabolic processes taking place in these layers resulting from, as well as yielding, different habitat chemistries. However, this study, like virtually all other studies on microbial communities, only assessed a subset of the total microorganisms present. Furthermore, it has solely relied on the commonly used phylogenetic marker, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence, to unravel the microbial communities. Use of this marker to indicate function assumes that functional properties are conserved among phylogenetically related populations, and that the function of Bnovel^organisms can be inferred by comparison with species that have been previously cultivated and characterized [21, 50] . It is known that there are pitfalls in these assumptions, and a cautious approach is [9, 21, 26, 45, 50] . For instance, organisms occurring in the different niches in the sediment layers may have diversified at either the 16S rRNA gene or the functional gene levels, processes which both disentangle the link between phylogeny and function [17] . In addition, lateral gene transfer among prokaryotes is a significant force in microbial evolution, resulting in metabolic functions that show a paraphyletic distribution [48] . This has created uncertainty about the interpretation of taxonomies based on gene sequences in relation to phenetic taxonomy [17, 48] . One way to resolve the apparent riddle posed by the large diversity of phylogenetic types in the different sediment layers and the difficulty of firmly linking such types to function would obviously be to take a metagenomics approach that is possibly coupled to either stable isotope probing or DNA-based preenrichment methodology. These strategies strongly depend on the production of sufficient quantities of highly pure microbial community DNA clonable in, e.g., fosmid vectors. The 16S rRNA-based sequences found to be most dominant in this study, e.g., the ANME-2 related sequences, might be useful as probes that can either Bfish out^the underlying organisms from a sediment DNA pool or detect these at the cell level. Once DNA has been obtained (enriched), one might apply metagenomic cloning and sequencing to directly investigate the genetic link between phylogeny and potential function (on the basis of the sequences of the genes involved) and to ascertain whether the underlying organisms are indeed functionally dominant. The genetic information thus unlocked may then yield suitable probes or primer systems applicable in mRNA-based measurements. Using such approaches, a direct link can theoretically be made between the presence and the activities of the populations that play key roles in deep-sea sediments. To accomplish this and at the theoretical level, the identities and activities of the numerically dominant microorganisms in cold seeps should be further examined with respect to their importance in the consumption of methane or sulfide. An emphasis should be placed on the in situ detection of numerically abundant populations and their respective activities, for instance, via experiments in which the metabolism of labeled substrates (either 13 C-or 14 C-labeled) is combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization combined with stable carbon isotope measurement (FISH-SIMS) or substrate-tracking autoradiography fluorescent in situ hybridization (STAR-FISH). These activity measurements could be combined with molecular detection methods such as Breal-time^reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with sediment 16S rRNA as a template, DNA microarrays for functional gene analysis, and FISH to identify the abundance, activity, and viability of microbial populations.",Sander Heijs,2006,17431711,10.1007/s00248-006-9172-3
609893,Long-range acoustic scattering from a shallow-water mud-volcano cluster.,"Analysis of reverberation measurements in the Straits of Sicily shows high intensity, discrete, scattered returns 10-20 dB above background reverberation. These returns are due to scattering from mud volcanoes. The reverberation from the mud volcanoes at ranges of 15-22 km is reasonably consistent over these spatial scales (i.e., kilometers) and temporal scales of several hours; measurements separated by 4 years are also similar. Statistical characterization indicates that the reverberation associated with a mud-volcano cluster is strongly non-Rayleigh and that the reverberation can be characterized by a single (shape) parameter, roughly independent of frequency. The non-Rayleigh statistics, with a concomitant increase in the probability of false alarm, indicate that mud volcanoes are a likely source of clutter. Mean target strengths were estimated at 1-11 dB over 160-1400 Hz and are consistent with target strengths measured during a different year at short (direct-path) ranges. Accumulated evidence points to small (order 10 m diameter and several meters high) carbonate chimneys on the mud-volcano edifice as the scattering mechanism as opposed to the edifice itself or scattering from gas bubbles in the water column. Thus, the results represent acoustic scattering from mud volcanoes in a quiescent state.",N/A,Charles Holland,2007,17902831,10.1121/1.2773995
53183928,"Rare earth elements in mud volcano sediments from the Gulf of Cadiz, South Iberian Peninsula","Abstract Eight gravity cores (GC) were retrieved from the deep mud volcanoes Sagres, Bonjardim, Soloviev and Porto in the Gulf of Cadiz. Cores with 137 to 317 cm long were sliced in intervals of 15 to 20 cm thickness, and 46 samples were analyzed for grain size distribution, loss on ignition, Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn, Sr, Ba and the rare earth elements (REE) La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu. REE profile normalized to Post-Archean Australian Average Shale (PAAS) was dominated by a mid-REE bulge with a pronounced Eu enhancement. Sediment reducing conditions resulting from the anaerobic oxidation of methane probably contributed to the positive-Eu anomaly (1.18–2.19, PAAS normalization). Most likely, reactions near the sulfate-methane transition zone such as the precipitation of barium sulfate found at layers around 50-cm depth explain the enhancement of Eu/Eu* ratios. The Ce anomalies (0.93–1.09) were almost absent.",N/A,Lina Carvalho,2019,30380493,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.227
24969095,[Diversity of halophilic Actinomycetes from mud volcano in Xinjiang].,"OBJECTIVE ::: To know halophilic actinomycetes and their enzyme-producing ability from mud volcano in Usu County, Xinjiang, China. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Soil samples in mud volcano were isolated with five isolation media containing 5% and 10% NaCl (w/v) with dilution-plate method. The activities of lipase, galactosidase, amylase, esterase and cellulase from isolated strains were qualitatively detected by using five selective media. Base on morphological characteristics, test of salt tolerance, screening of enzymatic characters and sequencing of 16S rDNA gene, strains were selected for phylogenetic analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: A total of 43 halophilic actinomycetes and 3 extreme halophilic actinomycetes were obtained. Screening results for enzyme activity showed that 4 halophilic actinomycetes produced lipase, 30 strains produced galactosidase, 27 strains produced amylase, 6 strains produced esterase, 4 strains produced cellulose and 1 strain produced 4 enzymes simultaneously. According to 16S rDNA sequence analysis, 24 of 25 detected sequences were affiliated with Nocardiopsis, and the other one was Streptomyces. In the phylogenetic tree, strain 10006 producing 2 enzymes and Nocardiopsis exhalans (AY03600) showed 96.64% similarity (less than 97%), which indicated that strain 10006 was a possible new species. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: There are plenty of galactosidase or amylase-producing halophilic actinomycetes and higher enzyme-producing diversity of Nocardiopsis in Usu mud volcano.

19394643,Methane Seepage on Mars: Where to Look and Why,"Abstract Methane on Mars is a topic of special interest because of its potential association with microbial life. The variable detections of methane by the Curiosity rover, orbiters, and terrestrial telescopes, coupled with methane's short lifetime in the martian atmosphere, may imply an active gas source in the planet's subsurface, with migration and surface emission processes similar to those known on Earth as “gas seepage.” Here, we review the variety of subsurface processes that could result in methane seepage on Mars. Such methane could originate from abiotic chemical reactions, thermogenic alteration of abiotic or biotic organic matter, and ancient or extant microbial metabolism. These processes can occur over a wide range of temperatures, in both sedimentary and igneous rocks, and together they enhance the possibility that significant amounts of methane could have formed on early Mars. Methane seepage to the surface would occur preferentially along faults and fractures, through focused macro-seeps ...","T he existence of methane (CH 4 ) on Mars is a topic of primary interest in planetary exploration because of its potential link to microbial metabolic activity. Methane can be generated by, and can provide energy (as an electron donor) to, microbial communities (e.g., Schulte et al., 2006) . Methane, like other gases that can be produced in deep rocks, can also be a proxy for dynamic geologic and subsurface fluidcirculation processes. Spatially and temporally varying CH 4 , with concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 60 ppbv, has been detected in the martian atmosphere by the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater and by previous orbiter and Earth-based telescopic observations (e.g., Mumma et al., 2009; Fonti and Marzo, 2010; Geminale et al., 2011; Webster et al., 2015 Webster et al., , 2016 RoosSerote et al., 2016) . Methane was also reported in martian meteorites (e.g., Blamey et al., 2015) . The fact that CH 4 is estimated to have a relatively short lifetime in the martian atmosphere (about 300 years but potentially as short as 200 days or even a few hours near the surface; Lefèvre and Forget, 2009) , coupled with its varying abundance, may imply an active gas source in the planet's subsurface that periodically releases CH 4 to the atmosphere. Methane could be generated in trace amounts above the martian surface (possibly due to electrical discharges near iced ground [Robledo-Martinez et al., 2012] or UV irradiation [Section 3.2.4] ), but as is the case on Earth, larger amounts could be produced in the martian subsurface by a wide array of gas generation processes. Subsurface sources could be releasing either present-day methane or methane formed in the past and subsequently stored in clathrates, zeolites, or reservoirquality rocks trapped below sealing lithologies. The possibility of active subsurface sources of martian CH 4 implies the existence of a gas migration process known on Earth as ''gas seepage.'' Accordingly, in this paper, we concentrate on the subsurface mechanisms that could account for martian CH 4 , including its generation, storage, and seepage to the surface, as well as the likely physical manifestations of that seepage on the surface of the planet. We address these processes in detail, as some readers may be unfamiliar with the extensive body of knowledge of subsurface CH 4 generation and migration from the petroleum industry or the in-depth information on terrestrial methane seeps accumulated from decades of studies. For example, because CH 4 content is low in volcanic emissions, some have concluded that a geologic CH 4 source would not be important for Mars (e.g., Krasnopolsky, 2005) . Such conclusions neglect the array of geologic processes that could produce CH 4 on Mars. Similarly, clathrates occasionally have been misconceived as potential origins for martian methane. Yet clathrates are only a storage mechanism for CH 4 , and the question of the derivation of that CH 4 remains. Here, we address the scope of potential CH 4 generation processes for Mars, including some processes not generally recognized, and we clarify details of serpentinization and Fischer-Tropsch-type (FTT) reactions. We further discuss criteria for trapping or storing subsurface CH 4 on Mars as well as factors that could control CH 4 seepage to the martian surface, the types of surface manifestations that might reflect that seepage, and whether seepage could account for the various CH 4 detections on Mars. We conclude by combining all the above to identify sites or regions on Mars that may be prime candidates for methane release and may be priority targets for orbital scans (such as by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter) and for landed, ground-based analysis (using optimum seepage-detection methods) in future missions. This work is divided into the following Sections: Section 2: Gas seepage fundamentals (definitions, mechanisms, surface manifestations, and fluxes on Earth) Section 3: Methane generation mechanisms Section 4: Potential sites and timing of methane generation on Mars Section 5: Potential sites of methane accumulation on Mars Section 6: Seepage pathways on Mars (from sites of generation or accumulation to the surface) Section 7: Potential sites of methane seepage on Mars Section 8: Can seepage fluxes support observed atmospheric CH 4 concentrations? Section 9: How to detect gas seepage on Mars (optimum methods) Section 10: Summary and Conclusions   In Earth sciences, the term ''gas seepage'' is used to indicate a steady or episodic, slow or rapid flow of gaseous hydrocarbons from subsurface sources to the surface (Etiope, 2015) . In the petroleum geochemistry literature, the term ''seepage'' refers to hydrocarbon fluids, gas, and oil, where gases are composed mainly of methane, with subordinate amounts of heavier alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane). These gases are formed in sedimentary rocks mainly through decomposition (microbial or thermogenic) of organic matter. ''Seepage'' has also been used with reference to exhalations of abiotic methane formed in igneous (ultramafic) serpentinized rocks (e.g., Etiope, 2015; Etiope et al., 2016) , through inorganic reactions such as FTT synthesis (e.g., Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013) . Detailed description and classification of gas seepage processes on Earth, as well as their implications for resource exploration, atmospheric greenhouse gas budget, and the environment, are reported in a wide body of literature (e.g., Link, 1952; Hovland and Judd, 1988; Kopf, 2002; Etiope et al., 2009; Etiope and Klusman, 2010; Etiope, 2015; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017 , and references therein). Terrestrial gas seepage does not refer to geothermal or volcanic H 2 O-or CO 2 -rich gas manifestations (e.g., fumaroles, mofettes, and geysers) where hydrocarbons are a minor component. Accordingly, we do not use the term ''seepage'' for volcanic emissions, although we discuss this form of degassing. Like terrestrial seepage, and according to the general theory of gas migration in geologic media (e.g., MacElvain, 1969; Malmqvist and Kristiansson, 1985; Brown, 2000; Etiope and Martinelli, 2002) , methane in subsurface martian rocks should move preferably via advection, that is, in flow driven by pressure gradients and controlled by permeability (Darcy's law). Diffusion, the slow motion of gas molecules driven by concentration gradients (Fick's law), is important only at small scales, in low-permeability porous media and over long geologic time scales. Modeling studies have also suggested that diffusion cannot explain the methane plumes and concentration variations observed on Mars (Stevens et al., 2015 (Stevens et al., , 2017 . On Earth, pressurized gas can occur in both fine-grained rocks and in coarse-grained, reservoir rocks (which are porous and permeable and sealed by impermeable strata such as shales, permafrost, and salt). Reservoir rocks host gas produced in source rocks (or the ''kitchen'' as used in petroleum literature). Subsequent gas seepage can start from either gas-rich, fine-grained source rocks or, more frequently, from pressurized reservoirs. Seepage occurs preferentially through permeable pathways, such as faults and fractures and in breaches in sealing lithologies. Therefore, for understanding potential gas seepage on Mars, it is important to distinguish three main components: (a) gas generation sources, (b) pathways from sources at depth to the surface (gas migration routes), and (c) potential surface manifestations of that gas seepage. We believe, then, that it is opportune to clarify the difference between the origin of methane and the source of methane. Origin refers to its biotic or abiotic derivation, the genetic mechanism by which the methane is produced: biotic CH 4 is the methane formed from biotic organic precursors (such as kerogen) and/or from the action of microbial processes; abiotic CH 4 is the methane formed from abiotic precursors (such as meteoritic organics or CO 2 ) and where the conversion to CH 4 is not driven by microbes. Source refers to the loci from which methane starts its seepage journey to the surface and atmosphere, which may correspond, as noted above, to the rocks/sediments where gas originated (source rocks) or accumulated (reservoir rocks). Gas seepage on Earth can produce a variety of visible, morphological structures, cumulatively called ''macro-seeps.'' They include circular depressions or small mounds with venting gas, mud volcanoes, water springs with gas bubbling or high concentrations of dissolved gas. In addition, gas seepage may be in the form of diffuse exhalations from the ground (microseepage), without any specific morphological structure. A wide body of literature exists on gas seepage on Earth (e.g., Macgregor, 1993; Klusman et al. 2000; Abrams, 2005; Etiope et al., 2009; Etiope, 2015) . Here, we will review only the main concepts that can be useful for understanding potential seepage on Mars. 2.2.1. Macro-seeps. Macro-seeps (or seeps) are ''channeled'' flows of gas, typically associated with fault systems and morphological surface expression. The exact global number of seeps on Earth is unknown but appears to exceed 10,000 on FIG. 1. Schematic illustration of potential methane origins and seepage on Mars. Biotic methane from present-day microbial activity may only occur in the subsurface, even at great depths (shown near surface only for graphical reasons), and the gas may use faults and fractured rocks for exhalation to the surface. Geologic methane, not involving living organisms, includes abiotic processes and generation from ancient organic material of biotic derivation, either in sedimentary or igneous rocks (see text). CO 2 and H 2 (methane precursors in FTT reactions) can derive from C-bearing rocks, atmosphere-rock interactions, magmatic fluids, serpentinization (olivine hydration), radiolysis, and silicate cataclasis. Methane can be generated also in organic-rich source rocks and may accumulate in permeable/porous reservoir rocks. Temporary reservoirs, like clathrates, may host any type of methane. Irrespective of origin, gas generally migrates along faults or permeable layers and exhales to the surface through focused macro-seeps or diffuse microseepage. Volcanoes, as on Earth, may be very minor methane emitters. While this image highlights that gas seepage stems mainly from gas reservoirs or accumulations, in some cases gas may migrate to the surface directly from source rocks, if there are preferential pathways (faults, fractures) for degassing. Spatial scales of the surface manifestations are described in the text. Mud volcanoes are the largest expression of methane release into the atmosphere. These cone-shaped structures are produced over faults by advective up-welling of sediments (mud), fluidized by gas and water. Mud volcanism refers to ''sedimentary volcanism'' (not to be confused with magmatic volcanism). It represents an ensemble of subsurface movements of large masses of sediments and fluids, triggered by gravitational instabilities of low-density sediments that result from rapid sedimentation and overpressure and lead to formation of mobile shales, diapirs, diatremes, and mud intrusions (e.g., Kopf, 2002; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . The gas released by most mud volcanoes is that which previously accumulated in reservoirs (and interacted with the mobile shales). This gas is nearly always thermogenic methane (and on Earth this is biotic; Etiope et al., 2009 ), but in a few cases it can be dominated by CO 2 and N 2 where hydrocarbon systems are located close to geothermal areas or are related to the final stages of natural gas generation (Etiope, 2015 , and references therein). The gas can be released through continuous (steady-state) exhalations from craters, vents, and surrounding soil, intermittent blow-outs, and eruptions (Etiope and Milkov, 2004; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017 , and references therein). Mud volcanoes releasing abiotic methane are not known on Earth. Mud volcanism is a process that has likely occurred on Mars, as discussed in Section 7.1.1. Gas-rich springs of mineral waters and artesian aquifers may release an abundant gaseous phase to the atmosphere (Etiope, 2015) . Water may have a deep origin and may have interacted with gas during its ascent to the surface. Mineralwater springs have often been neglected as a vehicle for releasing hydrocarbons from subsurface accumulations, and few data (detailing concentrations and/or degassing fluxes) for dissolved gases are available. Recent studies have revealed the existence of many springs, in at least 16 countries, issuing from serpentinized peridotites, with abundant concentrations of abiotic methane (see reviews in Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013; Etiope and Schoell, 2014) . These springs are typically hyperalkaline, with pH >9, due to active serpentinization processes (Etiope et al., 2016 , and references therein). Microseepage is the slow, widespread exhalation of gas through rocks, throughout relatively large areas, conceptually independent from macro-seeps, but enhanced along faults (e.g., Brown, 2000; Etiope and Klusman, 2010) . The seepage magnitude is small enough to require instrumentation to detect. Like macro-seeps, microseepage on Earth is common in association with gas-oil fields; it was widely used, in fact, as an exploration tool to discover natural gas and oil reservoirs at depth. Microseepage flux may vary over time, depending on variations of gas pressures along the subsurface migration pathway or on seasonal changes in the soil, where bacterial methanotrophic activity may consume methane (especially in warmer periods). Seasonality in the flux rates is also apparent in climates where the soils freeze to a depth of 30-60 cm. 2.2.3. Methane seepage fluxes. In general, the CH 4 flux from macro-seeps is orders of magnitude greater than that from microseepage. For macro-seeps, it is important to note that the exhalation of CH 4 does not occur exclusively from the visible vents or craters. There is, in fact, a halo of seepage with no physical manifestations, called miniseepage (e.g., Etiope, 2015) , which surrounds the channeled seep. This is a transition area where gas flux gradually decreases, dropping to ''zero,'' tens or hundreds of meters from the central vent. Because such a transition area can be quite large, the miniseepage exhalation adds an amount of gas to the atmosphere that may be more than three times higher than that released from vents. Methane flux in gas seeps, either from individual vents or from an entire macro-seepage area (including miniseepage), may span a wide range of values, on the order of 10 1 to 10 3 tonnes year , with a global mean around 4 tonnes km -2 year -1 (Etiope and Klusman, 2010; Etiope, 2015) . However, since microseepage is widespread throughout vast sedimentary areas, its global output to the atmosphere was estimated to be higher (*10-25 million tonnes year -1 ) than that from gas seeps (*3-4 million tonnes year ; Etiope and Klusman, 2010; Etiope, 2015) . Methane on Mars can potentially derive from both subsurface (geologic or biologic) processes and exogenous processes (transport by interstellar dust and meteorites), as summarized in Fig. 1 . Here, we concentrate on subsurface processes and distinguish gas origins (the production systems) from methane storage and methane seepage systems, which are often confused. Methane origin has been considered in previous studies (e.g., Oze and Sharma, 2005; Atreya et al., 2007; Oze et al., 2012 ), but we add new concepts of thermogenesis of both abiotic and potentially biotic organics. We also discuss the possibility that subsurface methane could have been produced by ancient methanogenic microbes and that methane of any origin could be stored in sealed traps, clathrates, or zeolites. And finally, we clarify details of serpentinization (which does not produce methane) and the origin of methane by FTT reactions after serpentinization. The generation processes include the following: Biologic production (1) Modern microbial activity (by living methanogens) Geologic production (processes not involving living microbes) (2) Ancient microbial activity (3) Thermogenesis of abiotic or potentially biotic organics (4) FTT (Sabatier) reactions (5) UV irradiation or ablation-pyrolysis of meteoritic organics (6) High-temperature geothermal reactions (7) Magma (volcanic) degassing On Earth, methane can be formed by methanogenic microbes (anaerobes belonging to the domain Archaea) by CO 2 -reduction or acetate-fermentation pathways (e.g., Whiticar, 1999) , at temperatures from -11°C to more than 100°C (Tung et al., 2005; Jablonski et al., 2015) . These organisms have been found, in fact, in deep subsurface strata, in permafrost and ice at depths of *3 km, and in basalts at mid-ocean ridges. They require liquid water, a source of carbon, and H 2 . The carbon source is commonly CO 2 , though they can also utilize carbon in acetate, which can itself be a product of bacterial metabolism or thermal cracking of organic material (Wellsbury et al., 1997) . On Mars, methanogens could use CO 2 from the atmosphere, magmatic fluids, and carbonates, and they could use H 2 from serpentinization, radiolysis, cataclasis of silicates, and magmatic degassing (Schulte et al., 2006) . On Mars, the surface is generally thought to be inhospitable to current life (due to extremely low temperatures, high aridity, and high levels of radiation). For example, although data from the Radiation Assessment Detector on the Curiosity rover show surface radiation levels that would be lethal to even dormant examples of the radiation-resistant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans, these data also suggest that viable cells might survive in the subsurface below the top meter (Hassler et al., 2014) . Thus, potentially extant methanogens are likely to be restricted to the martian subsurface-in endolithic ecosystems within pore spaces of sediment and rock (Boston et al., 1992) and in ice and permafrost (Tung et al., 2005) . In these settings, extant methanogens could generate biological methane, and that gas could migrate to the surface along permeable fractures and faults. Calculations for Mars suggest that the 10 ppb methane in the martian atmosphere measured by Krasnopolsky et al. (2004) and Formisano et al. (2004) could be produced by living methanogens in habitats at temperatures of 0°C or greater, which, depending on local heat flow and thermal conductivity, could occur at depths from 150 m to 8 km (Tung et al., 2005) . 3.2. Geologic production 3.2.1. Ancient microbial activity. Methane could have been generated by ancient methanogens in subsurface rocks, in past geologic times. This would be analogous to fossil microbial natural gas in petroleum systems on Earth (e.g., Whiticar et al., 1986; Schoell, 1988; Hunt, 1996; Formolo, 2010) . Microbial methanogenesis would be expected to have occurred in low-temperature (<100°C) settings, in rocks with pore spaces sufficient to support endolithic communities, and at depths of a few tens of meters to a few kilometers (McMahon and Parnell, 2014) . Sources for CO 2 and H 2 would be similar to those discussed for modern microbial activity (Section 3.1). 3.2.2. Thermogenesis of abiotic or potentially biotic organics. Methane can be generated by thermal degradation of organic matter resulting from elevated temperatures associated with burial, magmatic heating, hydrothermal systems, and impacts. On Earth, sedimentary organic matter (kerogen) is converted to oil and gas by this process (often called ''organic maturation''), dependent mainly on elevated temperature at burial depths. On Mars, this type of origin could involve generation of methane from either abiotic organics (delivered to Mars by meteorites or interplanetary dust particles [IDPs] [Flynn, 1996; Benner et al., 2000; Sephton, 2002; Flynn et al., 2004; Llorca, 2004] ) or potentially biotic organics (possible remnants of ancient microbial life that could have existed on early Mars, as it did on the early Earth [Oehler and Allen, 2012a] ). Flynn (1996) 1238 OEHLER AND ETIOPE estimated that *10 15 kg of abiotic organic matter could have been delivered to Mars by IDPs, using present-day IDP fluxes. He concluded that this amount is comparable to the terrestrial biomass. But he additionally noted that, since the flux of meteoritic materials onto the surface of Mars was likely much higher in the first half billion years of Solar System evolution, significantly more IDP-sourced, abiotic organic matter may have accumulated on Mars in its earliest history. That material, subsequently, could have been transported and concentrated by fluvial processes on early Mars into the major sedimentary basins (Malin and Edgett, 2000; Carr and Head, 2010; Grotzinger and Milliken, 2012; Grotzinger et al., 2013) , where it could have been subjected to thermogenetic alteration (possibly yielding methane) due to burial and magmatic-or impactrelated heating. The thermal evolution of such martian organic matter would be expected to begin at temperatures above *60°C. This is the temperature at which methane begins to be produced along with a variety of C 2+ hydrocarbons in sedimentary basins on Earth. At increasing temperatures, methane becomes proportionately more significant, such that by temperatures of about 150°C, methane is the dominant product of thermogenesis (Tissot and Welte, 1978; Quigley and Mackenzie, 1988; Schoell, 1988; Hunt, 1996; Seewald et al., 1998; Seewald, 2003; Stolper et al., 2015) . Geothermal gradient (the increase of temperature with subsurface depth) is a key parameter for estimating required burial depths for methane-producing thermogenesis. On Earth, typical geothermal gradients in sedimentary basins are about 25-30°C km , and methane formation by thermogenesis typically begins at depths on the order of 2-2.5 km. Terrestrial gradients are well known from precise downhole temperature data acquired in many petroleum wells, but equivalent data for Mars are not available. Although the evolution of the martian crust-mantle system is complex and still debated (e.g., Grott et al., 2013) , martian geothermal gradients in the highlands have been estimated based on gravity and topography data from Mars Global Surveyor (McGovern et al., 2002 (McGovern et al., , 2004 ) and perhaps imply regional hydrothermal activity, possibly associated with impacts (Ehlmann et al., 2009 (Ehlmann et al., , 2011 McSween et al., 2015) . These results can be used to estimate depths of burial on early Mars that would be required for methane production by thermogenesis of organic matter (of any origin). For example, using a gradient of 20°C km -1 and assuming a surface temperature of 0°C, methane would begin to be produced at a depth of 3 km. Recent work suggests fill thicknesses in the martian lowlands of *2 to 4 km over most of the area and *5 km in Utopia (Tewelde and Zuber, 2013) , which are well within the range required for thermogenesis. Less burial would be required in areas with higher geothermal gradients due to heterogeneities in crustal thermal properties or heat flow (e.g., in magmatic centers or near very large impacts; Oehler et al., 2005) . For example, it is well recognized that impact-related heating can contribute to hydrocarbon generation on Earth . One study of the 5 km diameter Gardnos impact crater in Norway suggests that even small craters can produce enough heat to melt basement rocks and generate hydrocarbons from target organic matter (Parnell and Lindgren, 2006) . Other studies have investigated hydrothermal effects of impacts on Mars, with modeling results suggesting that temperatures generated in and below central peaks and crater rims can be in excess of 100-150°C, for durations ranging from 67,000 years for a 30 km diameter crater to 380,000 years for a 180 km diameter crater (Newsom et al., 2001; Hagerty and Newsom, 2003; Abramov and Kring, 2005; Kring, 2009a, 2009b; Ivanov and Pierazzo, 2011; Schwenzer et al., 2012) . Modeled results also show that the larger the impact, the greater the area of thermal effect, such that for impact craters >*100 km in diameter, the regions with subsurface temperatures >150°C can extend beyond the crater rim. Even in impacts where temperatures are so high that most organic matter is destroyed, it has been suggested that some methane could be generated and preserved in fluid inclusions in adjacent rocks (Wycherley et al., 2004) . Finally, pyrolysis studies of the abiotic organic matter in the Murchison meteorite show that thermal alteration of the insoluble organic matter produces hydrocarbons including methane (Okumura and Mimura, 2011) . Thus, methane production by thermogenesis of ancient organic material is possible on early Mars, particularly when considering combined effects of burial and enhanced heat flow from magmatism or impacts. Moreover, the estimates of the abundance of abiotic organics delivered to Mars by IDPs, coupled with the pyrolysis studies of Murchison organics, support the concept that abiotic organics could have provided significant starting material for methane-producing thermogenesis. Any methane generated at depth by thermogenesis would have subsequently migrated upward along faults and fractures until it either was trapped and sealed (see Section 5) or reached the surface and escaped to the atmosphere. 3.2.3. Fischer-Tropsch-type (Sabatier) reactions. FischerTropsch-type reactions are a major abiotic process of methane production on Earth, as described and discussed in detail by Etiope and Sherwood Lollar (2013) . The reactions refer to hydrogenation of an oxidized form of carbon (typically CO or CO 2 ); this process occurs over a wide range of temperatures (<100°C to *500°C). On Earth, CO is not an important natural gas, as it occurs only in trace amounts (ppbv or ppmv levels) in sedimentary or igneous environments. In contrast, CO 2 is a major gas in many geologic settings, and it may derive from multiple sources, mainly magma degassing and thermal decomposition of carbonates. So, the CO 2 -based FTT reaction (the Sabatier reaction) is the pathway that better simulates geologic fluids: Although the Sabatier synthesis is often considered in aqueous solution (assuming dissolved CO 2 and H 2 phases to simulate hydrothermal conditions), the reaction (based on heterogeneous catalysis) is effective only in a gas phase (e.g., Etiope, 2017) , and it should be assumed that abiotic FTT CH 4 production occurs in unsaturated rocks and gasfilled fractures. On Mars, CO 2 could derive from magma degassing, thermal decomposition of carbonates at great depths, and the atmosphere (e.g., Oze and Sharma, 2005) . Carbonates, in particular, have been detected in association with olivinerich rocks (e.g., at Nili Fossae [Ehlmann et al. 2008; Niles et al., 2013] and Syrtis Major [Michalski and Niles, 2010] ). For these reasons, the FTT-Sabatier reaction (or CO 2 hydrogenation) is certainly geologically reasonable to have occurred on Mars. The H 2 necessary for FTT-Sabatier reaction can derive from different sources: serpentinization, radiolysis, cataclasis of silicates in fault zones, or magmatic degassing (Smith et al., 2005) . Serpentinization, in particular, is widely invoked as a source of CH 4 on Mars (e.g., Oze and Sharma, 2005; Atreya et al., 2007 Schrenk et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2015) . The process is common on Earth in ultramafic rocks where it occurs over a wide range of temperatures (<100°C to *400°C) and is a major source of H 2 (e.g., Evans, 2004; Oze and Sharma, 2005; McCollom and Seewald, 2007) . Serpentinization is important in planetary studies, as the produced H 2 may serve as feedstock for the FTT reactions that could produce abiotic methane as well as an energy source for potential chemotrophic organisms (including methanogens; Schulte et al., 2006) . The existence of serpentinization on Mars is discussed in Section 4.2.1. In addition to molecular H 2 and CO 2 , the Sabatier reaction requires a metal catalyst, such as iron, nickel, chromium, and ruthenium. The occurrence of such catalysts in rocks, especially ruthenium that can support the reaction at very low temperatures (<100°C; Etiope and Ionescu, 2015) , is a key factor for the production of abiotic CH 4 . Consequently, while radiolysis in basalts may be an important source of H 2 on Earth and Mars, the paucity of metal catalysts in basalts (compared to ultramafic rocks) makes methane production from the FTT-Sabatier reaction less effective and probable in basalts. This may explain why on Earth abiotic methane is typically associated with ultramafic rocks, and not basalts. The existence of potential Sabatier catalysts on Mars is discussed in Section 4.2.2. organics. Methane can be produced by UV irradiation of organics. This process has been shown to occur in organic matter in carbonaceous chondrites and IDPs exposed to UV radiation, under simulated martian conditions (Keppler et al., 2012; Moores and Schuerger, 2012; Schuerger et al., 2012) . Results could support various levels of atmospheric methane (from *2-5 ppbv and even 8-10 ppbv) depending on the meteorite/IDP flux, the weight percent methane in the incoming materials, the organic carbon to methane conversion rate, and the lifetime of methane on the martian surface. It is additionally conceivable that some methane formed by UV irradiation on meteorites could be implanted in the regolith, though it is unlikely that this process could account for more than trivial amounts of subsurface methane. In addition, although the depth of UV penetration into martian materials is not well understood (Carrier et al., 2015) , it is likely to be shallow (on the order of a few hundred microns; Muñoz Caro et al., 2006) . Therefore, this process may contribute to some variation in background levels of atmospheric methane , but it is not likely to be a significant source for methane in the martian subsurface. 3.2.5. High-temperature geothermal reactions. Methane can be produced by a series of abiotic (non-FTT) mechanisms at temperatures above 150°C (Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013) . These mechanisms include hydrolysis or hydrogenation of metal carbides; CO, CO 2 , or carbonate reduction with H 2 O (>500°C); respeciation of C-O-H fluids during magma cooling (<600°C); carbonate-graphite metamorphism and reduction of graphite with H 2 O (<400°C); iron carbonate decomposition and siderite decomposition with H 2 O (300°C); thermal decomposition of carbonates (250-870°C); and uncatalyzed aqueous CO 2 reduction (>150°C) (Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013 , and references therein). Knowing which processes actually occur in terrestrial geothermal systems often remains elusive. In addition, geothermal fluids on Earth often interact with organic-rich sedimentary rocks such that it is not easy to distinguish methane of abiotic origin from that produced by thermal degradation of biotic organic matter (Fiebig et al., 2007) . However, geothermal fluids are dominated by CO 2 (and water vapor), and methane is typically a minor component. 3.2.6. Magma (volcanic) degassing. As on Earth, primordial methane could exist in deep martian rocks, magma, and the mantle, as a gas formed during Mars' accretion. Methane in magmatic fluids can also form from CO, CO 2 , or carbonate reduction at pressures between 5 and 11 GPa and temperatures ranging from 500°C to 1500°C (Scott et al., 2004) . This type of magmatic methane could be associated with ancient volcanic systems on Mars; and as Mars is likely, still, to be internally active with a potential for deep magmatic and hydrothermal activity (Dohm et al., 2008) , temperatures on the order of 700-1000°C may occur at depths of 50 km (Oze and Sharma, 2005) . However, it is important to note that, at least on Earth, magma does not contain significant amounts of methane (concentrations are generally on the order of a few ppbv), and volcanoes are not important methane emitters (Welhan, 1988; Capaccioni et al., 2004; Etiope et al., 2007; Fiebig et al., 2007) .  On Earth, organic-rich shales, concentrated in distal facies of sedimentary basins, are the major repositories for organic matter. It is in these facies that thermogenesis during burial commonly produces methane from alteration of biogenic kerogen preserved in the shales. On Mars, organic matter in fine-grained sediments could be abiotic (delivered to the planet by meteorites and IDPs; Flynn, 1996; Benner et al., 2000; Llorca, 2004) or biotic (derived from potential early life-forms transported into the basins and/or formed in place; Oehler and Allen, 2012a) . Such accumulations of organic matter could provide fuel for potential methanogenic microbes and additionally could be converted to hydrocarbons including methane by thermogenesis (as described in Section 3.2.2). Figure 2A illustrates key regional features on Mars, including the large quasi-circular depressions (QCDs) in the northern plains, interpreted to be basins formed by major impacts that occurred during the early Noachian, between *4.2 and 4 Ga (Frey et al., 2002; Frey, 2004 Frey, , 2008 . These impact basins could house significant thicknesses of sedimentary units that were deposited in lakes, ponded water, or ocean basins during the wetter periods on Mars. For example, Acidalia is not only likely to have received sediments from runoff through the valley networks on early Mars, but it also would have been the focal point for deposition of fine-grained sediments carried into the Chryse-Acidalia embayment by the massive, late Hesperian Circum-Chryse outflows (Carr, 1979; Komar, 1979 Komar, , 1980 Rice and Edgett,1997; Kreslavsky and Head, 2002; Tanaka et al., 2005; Christensen, 2014a, 2014b) and possibly by contributions from the late Noachian to Hesperian Uzboi-Ladon-Morava (ULM) outflows (Irwin and Grant, 2013) . Streamlined islands in northern Chryse and southern Acidalia, as well as the continuous deepening of topography at the intersection of the two basins, argue for significant spillover from Chryse into Acidalia during the flooding events. Together, these data suggest that ancient distal-facies sediments are likely to be concentrated in Acidalia. A distal-facies scenario can be supported, additionally, by the occurrence of mud-volcano-like mounds and giant polygons, both of which have analogies to terrestrial features that occur exclusively in thick accumulations of fine-grained sediments Allen, 2010, 2012b; Etiope et al., 2011b) . Utopia is similar in that it is a huge, Noachian lowland basin that would have received runoff from the valley networks on early Mars as well as infill from outflows that traverse well into the basin. The Utopia outflows are thought to have been early Amazonian and appear to consist of both lava and debris/mud flows that originate from the southwestern flank of Elysium Mons (Thomson and Head, 2001; Russell and Head, 2003) . Fine-grained, distal facies of the debris flows could have accumulated in the deeper parts of the basin and may have concentrated organics that were present in the catchment area. Like Acidalia, Utopia is characterized by mud-volcano-like mounds and giant polygons (Skinner and Tanaka, 2007; McGowan and McGill, 2010; Ivanov et al., 2014) . Both basins have some of the lowest elevations in the northern plains and show a profusion of craters with doublelayer ejecta morphologies; these ejecta morphologies have been interpreted as reflecting ancient topographic lows that may have served as depo-centers for sediments and fluids from outflow floods or past lakes/oceans (Barlow and Perez, 2003) . The proximity of Utopia to Elysium Mons and of Acidalia to faults radiating from Alba Patera in the Tharsis region (Fig. 2B) provides the possibility of magmatic heating in addition to heating due to burial and impact in these two basins, and this heating could have enhanced thermal alteration of accumulated organics. Other areas for potential methane generation could include portions of the proposed giant basin in Arabia Terra , the ULM system of paleo-lakes (Irwin and Grant, 2013) , valleys in the Valles Marineris system, the giant Hellas and Argyre impact basins, and Isidis and Chryse Planitiae in the northern plains ( Fig. 2A) . Each of these areas has the potential to have been a site of concentration and preservation of organic materials that could subsequently have been thermally cracked to methane, given sufficient heating from impacts, burial, or magmatic input from the major volcanic constructs (Tharsis, Elysium Mons, and Syrtis Major; Fig. 2B ). Given that heat flows for the Noachian are expected to be 2-4 times higher than that of present-day Mars (Clifford et al., 2010) , coupled with the fact that large impacts were most common early in martian history, subsurface conditions for thermogenesis may have been most favorable on Mars in the early part of its history. Intrusive mafic and ultramafic rocks are sites where methane produced by FTT-Sabatier reactions could occur. As discussed in Section 3.2.3, the FTT-Sabatier reaction requires H 2 , CO 2 , and metal catalysts. Serpentinization is just one method of producing H 2 , but for Mars it is particularly important because (a) it has been actually detected by CRISM (Ehlmann et al., 2010) , and (b) it can occur in ultramafic rocks that host the necessary catalysts for the FTTSabatier reaction. 4.2.1. Serpentinization sites. We know that serpentinization has occurred on Mars from orbital detections of serpentine by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) (Ehlmann et al., 2010) . In addition, recent work based on martian crustal petrology suggests that serpentinization may have been a major process in the martian subsurface that could have produced 2 orders of magnitude more H 2 than radiolysis (Mustard and Tarnas, 2017) . Olivine and pyroxene required for serpentinization are common minerals on Mars, as shown by a variety of orbital and rover-based studies as well as analyses of martian meteorites Hoefen et al., 2003; Bibring et al., 2005; Mustard et al., 2005; Rogers et al., 2005; Poulet et al., 2007; Koeppen and Hamilton, 2008; Salvatore et al., 2010; Ody et al., 2012 Ody et al., , 2013 Bish et al., 2013; Mustard and Tarnas, 2017) . For example, olivine is a component of most nakhlites and comprises *60% of some shergottites and 85-90% of chassignites (Treiman et al., 2007; Koeppen and Hamilton, 2008) . Data from the Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activité (OMEGA) on ESA's Mars Express Orbiter and the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor show significant distributions of olivine in the southern highlands and specific concentrations at Nili Fossae, Terra Tyrrhena, north Argyre, and eastern Valles Marineris (Fig. 2A) ; pyroxene has similar global distributions, as summarized by Koeppen and Hamilton (2008) . Finally, large blocks of the ultramafic rock, dunite (typically having >90% olivine), have been identified by orbital spectroscopy in mega-breccia in central peaks (Mustard and Tarnas, 2017) . Until recently, there were few confident CRISM detections of mafic minerals in bedrock of the lowlands. However, several studies have since detected olivine and pyroxene in crater walls, rims, and ejecta within the lowlands. Salvatore et al. (2010) reported olivine and clinopyroxene in 182 craters in Acidalia and Chryse Planitiae and concluded that in southern Acidalia and Chryse Planitiae basaltic bedrock exposure occurs just meters below the surface. Similar results were obtained from Utopia impact craters by Ody et al. (2014) , using OMEGA and CRISM data. These authors further noted that the entire northern plains may have been blanketed by thick, olivine-rich basalt, supporting the earlier suggestion of Head et al. (2002) that the northern plains were filled by * a kilometer-thick layer of lavas during the early Hesperian. And Pan et al. (2016) reported CRISM analyses of 431 lowland craters, suggesting that olivine and pyroxene are present in the subsurface of the lowlands from the near surface to depths of several kilometers. While the combination of all these data suggests that basalts, and possibly ultramafics, are common in the crust of Mars, actual detections of serpentine are relatively few. Recent serpentine detections by CRISM include several Noachian examples (Nili Fossae, west of Isidis, the Claritas Rise, and a few craters in Arabia Terra; Ehlmann et al., 2010) . The detections at Nili Fossae occur along with olivine and carbonate in a heavily fractured unit; this would be consistent with serpentinization, as these minerals represent both the reactants and products of the process, and the fractured fabric of that unit (and a possibly similar example shown in Fig. 4A ) could be explained by the 30-50% volume-expansion that occurs when olivine is converted to serpentine (Ehlmann et al., 2010) . These observations support the conclusion that the process of serpentinization has occurred on Mars in the past. However, regarding the paucity of  OEHLER AND ETIOPE serpentine detections, it is important to remember that CRISM only detects minerals at the martian surface, in areas with little dust, and that any present-day serpentinization (which could only occur at depth where liquid water is stable) would not be detectable by CRISM, nor would serpentine that formed in the past that is either dust-covered or buried by younger sediments. Therefore, even though only few clear serpentine detections are known, it is certainly possible that serpentinization has been (and still could be) a major process on Mars. Primary filters for prediction of sites where serpentinization could occur on Mars would be the presence of olivine, pyroxene, and liquid water. As noted above, olivine and pyroxene are clearly abundant in the highlands, and relatively recent data suggest that the lowlands, too, contain significant buried basalt that is rich in these key minerals (Salvatore et al., 2010; Ody et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2016) . These results are consistent with the work of Frey (2006a Frey ( , 2006b , suggesting that the deep, buried crust of the lowlands is ancient (no younger than early Noachian), and with comments by Schulte et al. (2006) that the crust of Mars may be more ultramafic than previously appreciated. It may be, therefore, that the older, buried crust in the lowlands resembles the Noachian crust of the highlands in mineral content. If so, this would provide Mars with a global presence of olivine and pyroxene that could be subject to serpentinization, when exposed to liquid water for relatively long periods of time. Areas (see Fig. 2A-2B ) with potential for significant input of liquid water would include the deep basins of the lowlands, where runoff, outflow activity, and potential ocean waters would have been concentrated. Other sites may exist along the martian dichotomy (where deep faulting may have opened conduits for long-lived upwelling fluids; see Section 6); some of the chasmata of Valles Marineris (again because of expected deep faulting); the 1200 km diameter, Noachian Argyre impact basin in the highlands (where deep impactgenerated faults have been proposed as conduits for longlived fluid migration; Soare et al., 2014) ; and other sites of deep fracturing (e.g., those associated with the buildup of Tharsis). Additional areas might include the ULM system of lakes and the proposed ancient basin in Arabia Terra. Finally, proximity to the large shield volcanoes (Tharsis, Syrtis Major, and Elysium Mons) might enhance the long-term presence of liquid water in the subsurface. The need for liquid water might argue that the process of serpentinization may have been most common on the planet in its early history, and in the subsurface, when combined effects of relatively high concentrations of radiogenic materials, heating from magmatic centers, and permeation of surface runoff could have resulted in an abundance of liquids at depth. 4.2.2. FTT-Sabatier reaction sites. Ultramafics are the best rocks for FTT-Sabatier reactions. These reactions require, in addition to H 2 and CO 2 or CO, a metal catalyst such as Fe, Ni, Cr, and Ru. In this respect, it is useful to note that, on Earth, a peculiar relationship exists between abiotic CH 4 and chromitites occurring in ophiolites or peridotite massifs in association with serpentinized rocks (Etiope and Ionescu, 2015) . Chromitite (an igneous cumulate rock composed mainly of the mineral chromite [FeCr 2 O 4 ]) can contain significant amounts of FTT catalysts and especially ruthenium. Ruthenium is a powerful catalyst that is known to be capable of supporting the Sabatier reaction at very low temperatures (even 20-25°C) without the need for hot hydrothermal environments. Chromite with ruthenium actually exists on Mars; it has been detected in the martian meteorites, Chassigny and the Chassignite NWA 2737, where ruthenium concentrations extend up to 160 ppb ( Jones et al., 2003; Baumgartner et al., 2016) . Mars Global Surveyor TES data were used to map possible source locations for Chassigny (actually, sites with olivine spectral components like those of Chassigny; Hamilton et al., 2003; Koeppen and Hamilton, 2008) ; the main sites identified were in faulted terrains in Nili Fossae, eastern Valles Marineris, and northern Argyre (Fig. 5) . The metal catalysts Ni, Fe, and Cr, which are particularly abundant in chromitites and other intrusive igneous rocks, could also support the Sabatier reaction, but they need higher temperatures, generally above 200°C (Wang et al., 2011; Etiope and Ionescu, 2015) . It is likely then that these elements could be important for FTT reactions on Mars in very deep rocks or in regions of high heat flow. Hot fluids and magmatic systems existed on Mars in the past in several volcanic provinces, mainly Tharsis, Elysium Mons, and Syrtis Major ( Fig. 2A) . Tharsis is the largest volcanic area on Mars, more than 20 million km 2 in areal extent and including five large volcanoes (Olympus Mons, Alba Patera, and the three volcanoes of Tharsis Montes). While most of the activity in these martian volcanoes occurred in the past, these areas, by analogy with extinct volcanoes on Earth, could still host active geothermal-magmatic fluid circulation at depths of a few kilometers (Dohm et al., 2008) . Accordingly, they could represent potential sources of past or present methane. While we note again that magmatic systems (if they do not interact with organic-rich sediments) bear only trivial amounts of methane on Earth, even part-perbillion-by-volume concentrations of methane on Mars could represent a significant contribution to the low CH 4 levels of the martian atmosphere. After methane is generated, it will migrate in the subsurface along permeable layers/fractures until it is either trapped (in porous reservoirs, clathrates, or zeolites) or expelled by seepage at the surface. In some cases, hydrocarbons seep directly from source rocks (e.g., Etiope et al., 2013a) that may be fractured and/or have high pore-fluid pressures due to hydrocarbon generation (Passey et al., 2010; Feinstein et al., 2015) . Traps with effective seals (cap rocks) are a prerequisite for conventional gas accumulations. Because plate tectonics has been minimal to nonexistent on Mars (Section 6), it might be thought that structural traps would be less abundant on Mars than on Earth. However, impact processes result in faulted terrains (Fig. 6) (Melosh, 1989; , particularly in complex craters (which on Mars are generally >7 km in diameter), and these faulted terrains create a variety of traps that could host methane accumulations. For example, on Earth, dozens of impact structures in North America produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons that are trapped in impact-related central uplifts, crater rims, slump terraces, and likely subcrater fracture zones (Donofrio, 1998; Barton et al., 2010) . In addition, data from Haughton Crater, a 23 km diameter crater in the Canadian Arctic (studied intensely in outcrop and through seismic data; , illustrate the complexity of structures formed by the impact process (uplifted fault blocks; concentric, radial, and detachment faults; collapse graben; rollover anticlines), many of which could produce traps for migrating gas. So even with limited to no plate tectonics, it is likely that the martian subsurface could contain an extensive network of impact-induced traps. Impacts on Mars are abundant in both the southern highlands and the northern lowlands, even though many of the oldest craters in the lowlands have been buried by subsequent sedimentation and are detected only as ''ghost'' or ''stealth'' craters (where only hints of their rims are apparent in visible data) or QCDs (that are only detectable in MOLA data) (Frey, 2004 (Frey, , 2006a (Frey, , 2006b . If effective seals are present, then it is possible that methane accumulations in these types of traps could persist in the subsurface for extended periods. Effective seals for methane are typically thick, laterally continuous, ductile rocks with high capillary entry pressures; among the best are salt, anhydrite, and continuous permafrost (Portnov et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) . It has been suggested that, on Mars, the cryosphere is kilometers thick (Clifford et al., 2010) , and extensive ground ice (perhaps the remnant of an ancient ocean) exists in the lowlands (Mouginot et al., 2012; Clifford et al., 2013; Petitjean et al., 2014; Stuurman et al., 2016) . This ice could form effective permafrost seals,  enhancing the possibility that trapped subsurface methane could exist in the martian lowlands. On Mars, reservoir-quality rocks within sealed traps could act as methane reservoirs, as could clathrates and zeolites (Downey, 1984; Chastain and Chevrier, 2007; Max et al., 2011 Max et al., , 2013 Lasue et al., 2015; Mousis et al., 2016) . Reservoirs can be either porous and permeable sedimentary rocks (like sandstone) or fractured rocks with lower intrinsic porosity (like some carbonates, basalts, and ultramafics), where the fracturing produces secondary porosity and permeability, creating storage space for gas or liquids. Discussions of martian rock fracturing, porosity, and permeability are included in the works of MacKinnon and Tanaka (1989) and Hanna and Phillips (2005) and references therein (also see discussion in Section 6). In addition, olivine hydration generates large volume changes and high local strains and stresses with resultant cracking (Macdonald and Fyfe, 1985; Etiope et al., 2013b) , so it is possible that, on Mars, fracturing during serpentinization may form important reservoir rocks. Clathrates are crystalline, ice-like structures that hold methane within the cagelike lattice of frozen water molecules. On Earth, they typically form in cold, deep ocean settings, within the hydrate stability zone, which commonly extends downward from the sediment-water interface into the subsurface. Below the hydrate stability zone, methane will exist as a gas. Methane clathrates require either liquid water or ice to form, and they are common in permafrost and subsurface sediments along continental margins. They tend to form in coarse-grained sediments with high permeability, where migrating gas and ice can accumulate. On Mars, methane clathrates are estimated to occur over a great range of depths (10 m to 20 km; Max et al., 2013) and may provide a storage capacity of *3.3 · 10 14 to 3.5 · 10 17 tonnes of CH 4 (Lasue et al., 2015) , an amount that could account for sporadic, episodic releases such as the *19,000 tonnes implied by Mumma et al. (2009) . Zeolites, which form by reaction of alkaline waters with volcanic rocks and ash, have been detected in numerous settings on Mars (Ruff, 2004; Ehlmann et al., 2009; Carter et al., 2013) , and they are expected to be widespread in the martian regolith ( concluded that most zeolites formed during the Noachian, though they also reported some in the younger lowlands (possibly related to ice-volcano interactions). The mechanism of trapping and storage of methane is proposed to be adsorption into the ring structure of the zeolites, with chabazite and clinoptilolite having ring structures sufficiently large to accommodate methane molecules. Zeolites would be expected to be most abundant in settings where liquid water has been long-lived and in contact with volcanoes. The Acidalia and Utopia basins stand out as excellent candidates for hosting sealed traps where methane may have accumulated in the subsurface. These lowland basins were depo-centers for ''immense'' volumes of water in the past (Thomson and Head, 2001; Christensen, 2014a, 2014b) , and because of their northern latitudes, they have the potential to contain thick and continuous permafrost that could host clathrates and zeolites, and seal trapped methane. Such methane could ultimately be abiotic and/or biotic, and it could be recent or ancient. On Earth, faults and fractured rocks represent preferential pathways for seeping gas, and it is expected the same would occur on Mars. However, many faults and fractures on Earth are associated with plate tectonics. On Mars, plate tectonics is generally thought to have been absent for most of the planet's history. There is some evidence for very early (>4 Ga) plate tectonic activity on the planet (Sleep, 1994; Connerney et al., 1999; Dohm et al., 2015) , and one study has suggested possible recent, though minor, plate tectonic activity in Valles Marineris (Yin, 2012) . Nevertheless, Mars has had its own history of tectonism and faulting that resulted from stresses related to the formation and evolution of the dichotomy, the Noachian-Hesperian buildup of Tharsis, planetary cooling, Amazonian volcanism, and continuing impacts (Golombek and Phillips, 2009; Grott et al., 2013) . Moreover, any of the major faults and fracture systems that developed early in the planet's history may have been reactivated by subsequent stresses, as is common on Earth. So, while the tectonic history of Mars has been very different from that of Earth, there is a profusion of faults and fracture networks on Mars that could serve as conduits for gas migration in the subsurface (Fig. 2B) . For example, Tharsis ( Fig. 2A-2B ) is an enormous, elevated volcanic edifice that covers about a third of the planet and is surrounded by an extensive system of radial extensional features (rifts and graben; Knapmeyer et al., 2006; Hauber et al., 2010) and generally concentric compressional features that form wrinkle ridges (thought to overlie thrust faults) that continue over the entire western hemisphere (Banerdt et al., 1992) and large portions of the northern lowlands (Withers and Neumann, 2001; Head et al., 2002) . These could provide routes for fluid migration from great depth. The dichotomy on Mars also could provide routes for seeping methane. The dichotomy marks the boundary between the northern lowlands and southern highlands, with major differences in elevation (*5 km) and crustal thickness (*32 km in the north versus *58 km in the south) (Golombek and Phillips, 2009) . One explanation for the dichotomy is that it represents the rim of a huge, oblique impact that formed the lowlands in one of the earliest recorded geologic events on the planet (Wilhems and Squyres, 1984; AndrewsHanna et al., 2008; Marinova et al., 2008; Golombek and Phillips, 2009) . Ongoing activity along the dichotomy is suggested by erosion along that boundary and possible late Noachian/early Hesperian deformation, perhaps due to faulting in response to flexural stresses caused by differences in crustal thickness as well as bending, erosion, and global contraction (Watters, 2003a (Watters, , 2003b or relaxation of the boundary by lower crustal flow (Guest and Smrekar, 2005) . Mapped extensional faults also can be seen to be concentrated along portions of the dichotomy (Fig. 2B) , particularly in the regions west of Isidis and east of Gale Crater. These faults could extend exceedingly deep into the subsurface and may have been reactivated throughout martian history by continuing planetary stresses, providing long-term conduits for seeping fluids. In addition, impact craters on Mars most likely provide an extensively fractured subsurface (e.g., Fig. 6 ). Impact fracturing has been studied by experimental and simulation models coupled with field observations, drilling results, and seismic studies of terrestrial impact craters (Melosh, 1989; Kumar and Kring, 2008; Salguero-Hernández et al., 2010) . Results suggest that such fracturing extends deep into the subsurface. For example, the *1.2 km diameter Meteor Crater shows fracturing to depths of *1 km, and the 22 km diameter Ries Crater shows fractured basement to *6 km depth (Ahrens et al., 2002) . Because of the density of impact craters on Mars, including the buried and ghost craters in the northern lowlands (e.g., Frey et al., 2002; Frey, 2004 Frey, , 2008 , it is likely that the subsurface of Mars is heavily fractured. A similar conclusion was reached by Rodríguez et al. (2005) . Additional faulting (Fig. 4) on Mars may be related to local tectonism, from basin subsidence or uplift (due to sediment deposition and erosion/ice sublimation, respectively), as well as from lateral compressional or extensional stresses. Giant polygons (Fig. 4C ) may also provide pathways for seeping fluids. These features are exclusive to the martian lowlands and are particularly abundant in Acidalia and Utopia. The origin of these fractures is still debated, but one terrestrial analogy suggests that they may form in areas of subaqueous fine-grained sediment accumulation and could function as both sources and conduits for seeping fluids, including methane (Oehler and Allen, 2012b) . By analogy to the terrestrial polygons, the fractures of the giant polygons in Acidalia and Utopia could penetrate to depths of *700 m. Though not as deep as faults and fractures associated with Tharsis, the dichotomy, or large impacts, the fractures associated with the giant polygons on Mars could link with deeper fractures, providing near-surface enhancement of potential methane seepage. In summary, the martian subsurface is likely to be highly fractured. Faults from an early phase of plate tectonics, the buildup of Tharsis, the dichotomy-forming event, and major impacts would penetrate deep into the subsurface and could potentially tap liquid water and provide conduits for seeping methane. Other faults, associated with smaller impacts, local tectonics, and possibly the giant polygons, would provide a shallower network that could link some of the deeper faults to the surface. This scenario provides multiple pathways for methane seepage, and methane generated at depth could migrate through these fracture networks as well as updip 1246 OEHLER AND ETIOPE along tilted permeable beds and along unconformity surfaces below crater fill (e.g., Fig. 6 ). On Mars, we have observed diverse features that resemble some of the terrestrial expressions of macro-seeps, including mud-volcano-like mounds, possible ancient spring deposits, and flow structures along crater rims. Other sites are highlighted as potential locations for microseepage (the diffuse exhalations). Clearly, evaluation of candidate methane release sites requires assessment of potential locations of subsurface methane generation and accumulation as well as the presence of faults/fractures that could facilitate seepage. Examples are discussed below. Most of the known martian features that could represent gas macro-seeps are ancient. While they may have been sites of methane emission in the past, they may remain as sites for some degree of continuing seepage today. Below, we discuss potential martian sites of macro-seepage in mud-volcano-like mounds in Acidalia, Utopia, and other areas, possible ancient spring deposits, large crater rims, and geothermal-volcanic areas. 7.1.1. Mud-volcano-like structures-Acidalia, Utopia and other areas. Mud volcanoes are major methane macroseeps on Earth. Mud-volcano-like mounds are especially abundant in Acidalia (Fig. 7A-7G ) and Utopia and have been reported from numerous other areas, including Isidis, Scandia, Chryse Planitia, Candor Colles, Candor Chaos, Coprates Chasma, and craters in Arabia Terra (e.g., Davis and Tanaka, 1995; Tanaka, 1997 Tanaka, , 2005 Tanaka et al., 2000 Tanaka et al., , 2003 Tanaka et al., , 2008 Farrand et al., 2005; Kite et al., 2007; Rodríguez et al., 2007; Skinner and Tanaka, 2007; Allen et al., 2009 Allen et al., , 2013 McGowan, 2009; Oehler and Allen, 2009 Skinner and Mazzini, 2009; Chan et al., 2010; Komatsu, 2010; McGowan and McGill, 2010; Pondrelli et al., 2011; Franchi et al., 2014; Ivanov et al., 2014; Okubo, 2014 Okubo, , 2016 Komatsu et al., 2016a Komatsu et al., , 2016b . These martian mounds resemble terrestrial mud volcanoes (Fig. 7H-7J ) in many respects: size, circular to subcircular shapes, morphology including pitted cones or domes with flat to depressed crests, concentric crestal rings (similar to remnants of mud lakes in terrestrial mud volcanoes), moats suggestive of subsurface sediment removal, apronlike extensions onto the plains, associated lobate flows, and geologic setting where fine-grained materials (i.e., muds) are likely to have been deposited Allen, 2010, 2012a; Allen et al., 2013) . Although the subsurface character of the martian features cannot be determined as it can be for terrestrial mud volcanoes (by seismic investigation; e.g., Oehler and Allen, 2012a) , the martian mounds clearly are diapiric structures that have brought fluids to the surface of the planet from depth. Mud volcanism on Earth is caused by fluid overpressure in areas of rapid accumulation of thick sediment piles (Kopf, 2002; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . On Mars, overpressure has been suggested to explain several features in Gale Crater Rubin et al., 2017) , but in Acidalia and Utopia, overpressure development could have been far more significant due to the tremendous volumes of sediment and fluid that flowed into those basins from the circumChryse and Elysium outflows, respectively (Carr, 1987; Rice and Edgett,1997; Tanaka et al., 2005) . In Acidalia, *40,000 of the mud-volcano-like mounds are estimated (Fig. 7A) (Oehler and Allen, 2010) , and thousands occur in Utopia. Given their great numbers in these basins, as well as their common association with giant polygons (Fig. 7B ) and the enhanced seepage potential that giant-polygon fractures can add, Acidalia and Utopia could have been major sites of ancient methane release on Mars. Although these mounds and giant polygons are all thought to be ancient (Hesperian-early Amazonian), they may have remained as open conduits throughout the Amazonian, acting as continuing sites for macro-seepage or microseepage. Potential methane in these basins could have been generated at depth by thermogenesis of buried organics (see Section 3.2.2) as well as by FTT reactions (see Sections 3.2.3 and 4.2.2). In addition, the proximity of these basins to potential magmatic heat derived from Tharsis and Elysium Mons could add to the potential for thermogenesis as well as the longevity and extent of liquid water. These types of generation processes (thermogenesis and FTT reactions) would have been favored early in the history of Mars, when planetary heat flow and the potential for added heating from magmatism and large impacts would have been greatest. In more recent times, similar processes may have occurred, though at greater depths. Any produced deep methane could be stored in clathrates or possibly zeolites, or trapped in impact-related structures, sealed by permafrost in the proposed thick cryosphere (Clifford et al., 2010 Petitjean et al., 2014; Stuurman et al., 2016) . Such gas could be expelled episodically when permafrost melts or sublimes, when clathrates are destabilized (by changes in temperature or pressure), or when zeolites are destabilized (perhaps by impacts, seismic activity, or erosion; Mousis et al., 2016) . Added interest in these sites is provided by the possibility that clasts brought to the surface by these mud-volcano-like structures could provide windows into subsurface habitats (as occurs in terrestrial mud volcano clasts; Fig. 8 ), and such habitats might contain evidence of microbial martian life (if it ever existed). 7.1.2. Ancient springs. Like mud volcanoes, springs can represent methane macro-seeps. On Mars, potential hot spring deposits have been described from Gusev Crater with ground-based data acquired by the Spirit rover (location shown in Fig. 2A ) (Ruff et al., 2011; Ruff and Farmer, 2016) . The deposits are composed of opaline silica with digitate textures reminiscent of features in hot springs/geysers in Chile. Ancient spring deposits have also been proposed in Vernal Crater, Arabia Terra (Allen and Oehler, 2008) . These deposits include two light-toned, elliptical features, each with a bright central region and potential central vent (Fig. 9A-9B ). The features are associated with an extensive system of aligned knobs (suggestive of fluid flow up dipping beds or faults) and have been compared to spring mounds in the Dalhousie Complex of Australia (Fig. 9C-9D ). Other potential spring deposits have been described from Valles Marineris, some of the chaos terrains, and several additional large craters in Arabia Terra (Rossi et al., 2008) . All of these could be candidates for methane release, if connected through faults and fractures with sites of methane generation and accumulation at depth. 7.1.3. Flow structures along crater rims. Large crater rims could be sites of potential long-term methane seepage. This is because crater rims are likely to be sites of both intense fracturing (Rodríguez et al., 2005) and enhanced hydrothermal flow. Studies by Newsom et al. (2001) and Newsom (2012) suggest that craters larger than 50 km in diameter (and possibly larger than 10 km in diameter) are OEHLER AND ETIOPE predicted to have hydrothermal flow, particularly beyond the edges of the impact melt sheets (e.g., Fig. 6B ) and toward the fractures associated with the rim. An example of crater-rim flow structures is visible in the 120 km diameter ghost crater at the northern edge of the Chryse basin, where irregular knobs mark the rim (Fig. 10) . The rounded and lobate character of these knobs, coupled with their absence from crater centers and from fluidized ejecta, suggests that they have been produced in association with hydrothermal flow up the crater rim (Oehler and Allen, 2011) . Numerous ghost craters in southwest Acidalia Planitia and a few in southern Utopia Planitia show similar lobate features along their rims. Because of their locations in the major depo-centers of sedimentation and burial, these ghost craters may be in connection with methane generated at depth and could be reasonable sites for methane release. 7.1.4. Geothermal-volcanic areas. Associated with Tharsis and the other shield volcanoes on Mars are hundreds of smaller, satellite volcanoes, vents, and fissures (e.g., Hauber et al., 2011) . While much of the martian volcanic activity was in the Noachian and Hesperian, several studies indicate that volcanism is a continuing process on Mars, with activity as recent as 2 million years ago (Hartmann et al., 1999; Neukum et al., 2004; Hartmann, 2005; Schumacher and Breuer, 2007; Hauber et al., 2011) . Moreover, even apparently extinct volcanoes, by analogy with terrestrial examples, can still retain fluid circulation at a depth of a few kilometers (Dohm et al., 2008) and may even now exhale gas, albeit weakly, to the surface. Thus, both ancient and recent volcanism can provide sites for recurring gas exhalation to the surface. As noted (in Section 3.2.6), however, Earth magma contains trivial amounts of methane, and volcanoes are not important methane emitters. As discussed in Section 2.2.2, microseepage on Earth is the diffuse exhalation of gas (with no visible surface manifestation) that is widespread in association with hydrocarbon accumulations in sedimentary basins, especially along fault zones. Fault-related fissures on Earth are known to release methane, and these provide an analogue for potential sites of microseepage on Mars (Fig. 11) . Below, we discuss potential pathways for microseepage at Nili Fossae, the dichotomy, young faults of the Cerberus Fossae, the Argyre impact basin, and other faulted areas. 7.2.1. Nili Fossae. Nili Fossae is a prime location for methane seepage. The large faults of the Nili Fossae, located at the dichotomy (Figs. 2B, 11A-11B ), are likely related to the Isidis impact, as suggested by their concentric shape and position at the western edge of the Isidis basin. As a result, it is possible that the Nili Fossae may tap deep fluids that flowed up the impact-related rim faults as well as extensional faults associated with the dichotomy, and this combined flow from two separate sets of deep faults may provide enhanced potential for long-term flow of liquid water. Consistent with these observations is speculation that methane from combined serpentinization/FTT reactions might have seeped through deep faults at Nili Fossae-speculation supported by the facts that the Nili Fossae occur in a zone where fractured serpentinized rocks have been observed (Ehlmann et al. 2010) , where FTT reactions might have been promoted by necessary catalysts (e.g., Fig. 5B-5E and as described in Section 4.2.2), and where a methane plume was detected in 2003 by telescopic observations (Mumma et al., 2009) . In addition, the location of Nili Fossae provides the possibility that its faults also could connect to methane generated by thermogenesis or FTT reactions at depth in the Isidis or Utopia basins. In all these cases, methane generated in the past would have to be trapped in sealed reservoirs, clathrates, or zeolites to preserve that methane as a potential source for present-day releases. 7.2.2. The dichotomy. Numerous extensional faults have been mapped along the dichotomy (Fig. 2B) , and as noted above, these may provide long-term, deeply rooted pathways for fluid migration. A possible example of fluid flow related to the dichotomy is provided by orbital and Curiosity rover image data from Gale Crater (Fig. 12) , which not only has an abundance of fractures and mineral-filled veins in its sedimentary rocks Kronyak et al., 2015) but also an extensive network of boxwork deposits interpreted to reflect input of major volumes of groundwater early in Gale's history (Siebach and Grotzinger, 2014) . Faults along the dichotomy may additionally tap methane generated at depth in the northern basins. Nili Fossae and Gale Crater are two examples located on the dichotomy; other faults mapped along this boundary may provide additional sites for future consideration. 7.2.3. Cerberus Fossae. The Cerberus Fossae (Figs. 2B, 11C-11E) are a group of linear fissures in Elysium Planitia. They are radial to, and southeast of, Elysium Mons, extending for *1200 km. They have been interpreted as graben faults, tension cracks or collapse structures related to tectonic stresses associated with dike intrusion (e.g., Vetterlein and Roberts, 2010; Taylor et al., 2013) . These fissures are among the youngest volcano-tectonic features on Mars (between *10 and 100 million years in age) and have been suggested to be the source of lavas and repeated, late Amazonian aqueous flooding onto the plains (Burr et al., 2002a (Burr et al., , 2002b (Burr et al., , 2009 Head, 2003; Head et al., 2003) . Burr et al. (2002a) argued that the groundwater source for this flooding was at least several kilometers deep. If this is correct, the Cerberus Fossae must be major faults in communication with deep, liquid water in the plains, and as such, they would have the potential to tap any deep methane that may have been produced in Elysium Planitia. 7.2.4. The Argyre impact basin. Recent work has suggested that Argyre may be a site of long-lived, upward fluid flow through deep fractures formed by the Noachian (*3.9 Ga) impact that created this *1200 km diameter basin (Soare et al., 2014) . In addition, volcanism may be long-lived as well, with recent discovery of Argyre Mons, interpreted as a 3 Ga volcanic structure with possible late Amazonian activity (Williams et al., 2017) . And the TES analyses of Hamilton et al. (2003) and Koeppen and Hamilton (2008) identified northern Argyre as one of the areas with Chassigny-like concentrations of olivine (Fo 68 ). Together, these observations suggest that Argyre could have the ingredients for serpentinization to produce H 2 and FTT- Sabatier reactions to produce methane from that H 2 (utilizing catalysts present in Chassigny-like materials). In addition, the large size and deep basin formed by the Argyre impact may provide potential for organic matter to have been concentrated and methane to have been subsequently produced by thermogenesis (as described in Section 3.2.2). Recent work also argues that permafrost may be common in the Argyre subsurface (Soare et al., 2014 . That permafrost could provide storage for methane in clathrates, and it could also provide seals for trapped methane in subsurface reservoirs. Accordingly, Argyre is a candidate site of potential methane release. 7.2.5. Other areas. On Mars, additional sites for microseepage could include faults and fractures associated with (1) megabreccias (e.g., Fig. 4A ), (2) local stresses (e.g., at Danielson Crater; Fig. 4B ), (3) basin subsidence (e.g., at Aureum Chaos and perhaps other chaotic terrains on Mars; Spagnuolo et al., 2011) , and (4) the giant polygons of the martian lowlands (e.g., Fig. 4C ; Oehler and Allen, 2012b) . If any of these types of features overlie likely sites of methane generation, they could be considered as candidates for present-day methane release. The lifetime of methane on Mars is controlled by loss mechanisms (sinks), the conventional ones being photolysis by UV in the upper atmosphere (above 60 km) and oxidation by OH and O ( 1 D) at lower altitudes. The methane lifetime was estimated by Summers et al. (2002) to be *200-600 years. More recent models suggest that the spatial and temporal changes of CH 4 observed so far can only be explained by a greater sink (such as oxidation by hydrogen peroxide in the regolith), with a resulting shorter lifetime of 200 days or even a few hours near the surface (Lefèvre and Forget, 2009) . If this is correct, it would imply that a larger source than previously estimated is required to replenish methane in the martian atmosphere. The CH 4 plume observed in the northern summer of 2003 was estimated to reflect an emission of about 19,000 tonnes CH 4 year -1 (Mumma et al., 2009 ) and possibly even 570,000 tonnes year -1 (Chizek et al., 2010) . Examples of terrestrial analogues that might produce equivalent amounts of methane would include groups of large mud volcanoes (such as those in Azerbaijan, Romania, and coastal areas of the Black Sea) and regions of major Etiope et al., 2013b Etiope et al., , 2016 could account for the observed martian CH 4 plume. Recent modeling of CH 4 release on Mars indeed suggests that the northern summer 2003 plume was formed by a broad source rather than a point emission (Mischna et al., 2011) , just as microseepage operates. Seasonal processes of adsorption and desorption in the regolith (Hu et al., 2016) may also control the final microseepage output leading to episodic releases of methane into the atmosphere. On Earth, natural gas seepage can be detected by several techniques that have been widely tested and used for hydrocarbon exploration and studies of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., Philp and Crisp, 1982; Jones and Drozd, 1983; Klusman, 2006; Etiope and Klusman, 2010; Etiope, 2015) . The techniques can be based on (a) direct measurements of gas above the ground (atmospheric and remote sensing measurements), in the ground (soil and shallow wells), and in water bodies (shallow aquifers, springs, lakes, seas, etc.) or (b) indirect measurements, looking for proxies of seepage, such as physical, chemical, and biological changes in soils, sediments, rocks, or vegetation induced by hydrocarbons (e.g., Schumacher, 1996) . Methane from low flux seeps or microseepage may not be detected in atmospheric air because of winds and dispersion and dilution of the gas. In these cases, only specific ground-based investigations, such as soil-gas sampling and closed-chamber techniques or downhole analyses (e.g., Oehler and Sternberg, 1984) , can detect seepage signals. On Mars, the low and variable CH 4 concentrations observed so far in the atmosphere may suggest that seepage is not as relevant as on Earth; alternatively, if significant martian gas exhalations exist, CH 4 could be rapidly removed by strong consumption processes, such as oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (Lefèvre and Forget, 2009) . So, the strength of a potential martian seepage signal not only would depend on the distance of the measured signal from the source of seepage, but it could also be decreased by oxidation as well as wind and advective mixing (Viscardy et al., 2016) . It is because of these types of effects that even intense, but localized, methane seepage can be indistinguishable from atmospheric background, and measurements of methane 1 m above the ground, such as those performed by the Curiosity rover, may not be effective in revealing seepage that may be present. Consequently, opportune procedures and techniques should be adopted to detect seepage on Mars. The best way to detect even weak and ephemeral exhalations of gas from the ground is to use sampling devices that operate directly at the soil-atmosphere interface or in the soil or subsoil, similar to those used on Earth (Fig. 13) . We believe that soil-gas probes and accumulation chambers are viable techniques for Mars, as they are relatively simple and can be implemented using technology already developed and tested by NASA and ESA for martian exploration. For example, the team for NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission developed the Heat Flow and Physical Properties probe (HP 3 ) for measurement of temperature down to 5 m in the subsoil (Spohn et al., 2012; Banerdt et al., 2013) . A similar probe could be utilized to collect gas from the subsurface and analyze methane content by onboard instrumentation. Active instrument-deployment arms, similar to those designed for positioning a seismometer on InSight, can deploy closedchambers with diameters of 30-40 cm, as is typically used for measuring gas flux from the soil on Earth (e.g., Etiope and Klusman, 2010) . Closed-chambers, or accumulation chambers, allow the detection of higher concentrations of trace gases because they can accumulate gases in a closed system over a relatively short period of time (orders of minutes or a few hours, depending on the flux). And from the gas concentration buildup in the chamber, it is possible to evaluate the gas flux into the atmosphere. Chambers can be metallic, light, with a diameter of a few tens of centimeters and connected to a gas sampling and analysis system on board a lander or rover. The chamber can be reopened and closed for multiple measurements on the same spot. The sampling of gas in the ground (or at the groundatmosphere interface) also has the advantage of limiting possible secondary chemical alterations that may occur in the martian atmosphere, such as isotopic fractionation due to oxidation, which may modify the original isotopic character of CH 4 , an important parameter for determining gas origin. A similar problem may arise from molecular fractionation, whereby methane/ethane ratios in the atmosphere can be different from those in the subsoil, because of differential oxidation of gaseous hydrocarbons. An additional, but not minor, advantage of ground measurements is the direct knowledge of the seepage location, information that can be elusive in atmospheric and remote sensing detections, where methane-rich plumes or layers can form far from actual sites of seepage (Viscardy et al., 2016) . And knowing the geologic context of a seepage location is fundamental to understanding the potential origin of methane, as discussed in previous chapters. Methane seepage on Mars could also be identified by indirect methods (e.g., secondary carbonate and sulfate minerals, electrical resistivity, radiometric and redox processes) and integrated with high-resolution images. However, since many factors other than seepage can induce these types of nearsurface anomalies, direct methane-detection remains the best way to detect the existence of gas seepage on Mars. Based on all the above, we consider that these types of ground-based techniques should be applied on Mars preferably above or near faults or at the mud-volcano-like mounds, fluid-related mounds, ancient springs, and above sedimentary or ultramafic rocks, where FTT reactions are likely. Knowing the processes that govern methane formation and release on Earth is a necessary step toward understanding why and where methane seepage might occur and be detected on Mars. In this work, we have integrated the extensive knowledge of terrestrial methane with martian geology to define potential mechanisms of methane generation, accumulation, and seepage on Mars. Seven processes are identified that could generate methane in the subsurface of Mars. We emphasize that generated methane could be ancient or recent, and either biotic or abiotic. The generation processes could occur over a wide range of temperatures, in both lowland sedimentary basins and highland Noachian igneous rocks. To previous discussions, we have added potential generation by combinations of impact-and burial-thermogenesis of sedimentary organic matter, which itself could be abiotic (delivered by meteorites or IDPs) or biotic. The importance of metal catalysts for methanegenerating FTT reactions and the possibilities for trapping and storing ancient methane in the martian subsurface have also been described. Because early Mars likely had relatively high heat flows and intensity of large impactors, subsurface temperatures in the Noachian may have been particularly favorable for thermogenesis as well as FTT reactions. Together, then, these processes increase the possibility that significant methane could have formed in the subsurface of Mars, when the planet was young-a conclusion that may provide some support for the suggestion by Wordsworth et al. (2017) that methane release may have helped warm Mars early in its history. Methane generated in the subsurface could be stored in clathrates; zeolites; and reservoir-quality rocks that are sealed by permafrost, evaporites, or shales. Episodic release of stored methane could occur when seals are breached or when clathrates or zeolites are destabilized. Methane would seep to the surface along faults and fractures and could develop as macro-seeps (such as mud volcanoes, springs, or gas vents, as on Earth) or microseepage (diffuse emanations lacking surface expression). This analysis has highlighted the following sites on Mars as having special potential for methane release (Table 1) . These could be priority candidates for analysis in future missions, using orbital or landed, ground-based data. Acidalia and Utopia basins: These basins are of particular interest for releasing methane produced from thermogenesis of abiotic organics. Additional methane could have been generated by thermogenesis of possibly biotic organics or perhaps by combined serpentinization/FTT reactions in buried Noachian crust. The proximity of Acidalia and Utopia to Tharsis and Elysium Mons, respectively, may have provided relatively high heat flows, enhancing the potential for thermogenesis or FTT catalysis. Trapped methane could be sealed by the thick cryosphere or stored in clathrates or zeolites. And each of these areas has thousands of mudvolcano-like mounds, which could be sites of methane release and could provide clasts from the subsurface that could reveal potential endolithic habitats at depth. Nili Fossae stands out as a prime candidate for abiotic methane generation and seepage by the combination of potentially deep faults, serpentinization (H 2 ), carbonates (CO 2 ), and catalysts (e.g., ruthenium or other catalysts in chromitites) for the FTT-Sabatier reaction. Ancient methane would have to be sealed in conventional reservoirs/traps or stored in clathrates, and its episodic seepage to the atmosphere could explain the plumes detected by Mumma et al. (2009) . Potential spring deposits: Spring deposits proposed in Gusev Crater, Vernal Crater, Valles Marineris, and other localities in Arabia Terra could be sites of past or present methane seepage (if located in regions of methane generation). Particularly interesting are the deposits in Vernal Crater, as these are associated with aligned knobs that are suggestive of fluid flow along faults or dipping beds. Cerberus Fossae: These fractures in Elysium Planitia have been interpreted as recently active faults and the source of repeated flooding events. Burr et al. (2002a) suggested that the source of groundwater for these floods was at least several kilometers deep, implying that the fractures of the Cerberus Fossae are likely in communication with deep, liquid water. If mechanisms exist for generating methane at depth, the Cerberus Fossae could be a site of present-day methane release. The Argyre impact basin: Recent studies suggest that the deep and large Argyre basin is an area of long-lived fluid flow from depth as well as potentially long-lived volcanic activity. In addition, TES analyses argue that northern Argyre could host Chassigny-like materials that would be expected to contain abundant olivine and the key catalysts for the FTT-Sabatier reactions. Thus, Argyre would be a prime candidate for methane production, via both FTT reactions after serpentinization and thermogenesis of organic materials. Methane would seep toward the surface through deep faults associated with the basin-forming impact. It could then be stored in clathrates within permafrost or in trapped reservoir-quality rocks sealed by permafrost. We also note that even the lowest seepage fluxes on Earth could support the present-day atmospheric CH 4 concentrations observed on Mars. Weak microseepage exhalations, widespread over a few thousand square kilometers, could explain background-and plume-CH 4 -anomalies, even if macro-seeps, such as mud volcanoes, are lacking or are not active. Opportune procedures and techniques similar to those already available on Earth (soil-gas and closed-chamber methods) are recommended for use in the search for methane on Mars. Ground-based investigation (using rovers or landers) at sites of potential seepage can offer less ambiguous results than atmospheric measurements, because the ground-based methods allow capture of higher concentrations of CH 4 , which will be less affected by atmospheric fractionation and can be used for isotopic studies. Such investigations could produce the most definitive understanding of methane occurrence on the Red Planet.",Dorothy Oehler,2017,28771029,10.1089/ast.2017.1657
23169780,Identification of the dominant sulfate-reducing bacterial partner of anaerobic methanotrophs of the ANME-2 clade.,"Summary ::: ::: The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate as terminal electron acceptor is mediated by consortia of methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Whereas three clades of ANME have been repeatedly studied with respect to phylogeny, key genes and genomic capabilities, little is known about their sulfate-reducing partner. In order to identify the partner of anaerobic methanotrophs of the ANME-2 clade, bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed from cultures highly enriched for ANME-2a and ANME-2c in consortia with Deltaproteobacteria of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group (DSS). Phylogenetic analysis of those and publicly available sequences from AOM sites supported the hypothesis by Knittel and colleagues that the DSS partner belongs to the diverse SEEP-SRB1 cluster. Six subclusters of SEEP-SRB1, SEEP-SRB1a to SEEP-SRB1f, were proposed and specific oligonucleotide probes were designed. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization on samples from six different AOM sites, SEEP-SRB1a was identified as sulfate-reducing partner in up to 95% of total ANME-2 consortia. SEEP-SRB1a cells exhibited a rod-shaped, vibrioid, or coccoid morphology and were found to be associated with subgroups ANME-2a and ANME-2c. Moreover, SEEP-SRB1a was also detected in 8% to 23% of ANME-3 consortia in Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano sediments, previously described to be predominantly associated with SRB of the Desulfobulbus group. SEEP-SRB1a contributed to only 0.3% to 0.7% of all single cells in almost all samples indicating that these bacteria are highly adapted to a symbiotic relationship with ANME-2.",N/A,Lars Schreiber,2010,21966923,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02275.x
19286940,Structural characterization of hemoglobins from Monilifera and Frenulata tubeworms (Siboglinids): First discovery of giant hexagonal-bilayer hemoglobin in the former “Pogonophora” group,"Siboglinids are symbiotic polychete annelids having hemoglobins as essential oxygen- and sulfide-carriers for their endosymbiotic bacteria. We analyzed the structure of the hemoglobins from two species of siboglinids: the monilifera Sclerolinum contortum and the frenulata Oligobrachia webbi (i.e. haakonmosbiensis) from Norwegian cold seeps. Measured by Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS), Sclerolinum shows a 3190 ± 50 kDa hexagonal bilayer hemoglobin (HBL-Hb) and a 461 ± 46 kDa ring-Hb, just as vestimentifera, whereas Oligobrachia has a 409 ± 3.7 kDa ring-Hb only. Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) showed Sclerolinum HBL-Hb composed of seven monomeric globins (15–16 kDa), three disulfide-bonded globin heterodimers and three linkers. The heterodimers always contain globin-b (15814.4 ± 1.5 Da). Sclerolinum ring-Hb is composed of globins and dimers with identical masses as its HBL-Hb, but lacks linkers. Oligobrachia ring-Hb has three globin monomers (14–15 kDa) only, with no disulfide-bonded dimers. Comparison of Sclerolinum hemoglobins between Storegga and Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano, using the normalized height of deconvoluted ESI-MS peaks, shows differences in globin monomers abundances that could reflect genetic differences or differential gene expression between distinct seep populations. The discovery of HBL-Hb in Sclerolinum is a new element supporting the hypothesis of monilifera being phylogenetically more closely related to vestimentifera, than to frenulata.","Siboglinids are tube dwelling marine annelids having neither gut nor mouth, but relying on internal chemoautotrophic bacteria for their nutrition. They comprise in fact four symbiotic tubeworm clades: (1) the big vestimentifera found at hydrothermal vents or cold-seeps, (2) the thread-like frenulata buried in seeps, mud volcanoes or in anoxic firth sediments, (3) the thread-like monilifera in rotten wood, mud volcanoes or hydrothermal vents, and (4) the more recently discovered small Osedax spp. in decaying whale or cow bones (Rouse et al., 2004; Braby et al., 2007) . Both morphological data (bodysegmentation, chetae and larval type) and molecular cladistics indicate that all siboglinids are polychete annelids, see for review (Rouse 2001; Halanych 2005) . Frenulata and monilifera were formerly grouped together (Ivanov 1963; Ivanov 1991) under the name pogonophora meaning ""beard worm"" in Greek, due to their hair-like gill tentacles. However, the monilifera lack the anterior bridle (i.e. frenulum) characteristic of frenulata. This and several other morphological characteristics (see (Southward 2000) for review) led to distinguish monilifera from frenulata. Furthermore, based on 18S nuclear rDNA gene and 16S mitochondrial rDNA gene (Halanych 2001) showed monilifera as a sister group to vestimentifera. In this paper we will use the name ""pogonophora"" in a more practical than systematical sense, to indicate the thread-like siboglinids that include both frenulata and monilifera. With a single methanotrophic exception in Siboglinum poseidoni from Skagerrak (Schmaljohann and Flugel, 1987) , the symbiotic bacteria housed in the siboglinids are all sulfur-oxidizing, as in the two species found at the Norwegian margin: Sclerolinum contortum and Oligobrachia webbi (haakonmosbiensis) (Lösekann et al., 2008) . Although molecular sequences from symbionts of O. webbi (haakonmosbiensis) did cluster with those of O. mashikoi symbionts, in a clade unaffiliated with any known methane-or sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, the molecular data suggest that both Norwegian siboglinid species harbor chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing symbionts (Lösekann et al., 2008) . To feed the siboglinids need to intake oxygen, sulfide and carbon dioxide from the surrounding environment, and to bring these elements to their endosymbionts stored in the trophosome, a soft specialized tissue located in their posterior body-part. From these elements, the bacteria synthesize organic compounds that are transferred to the host, either by exocytosis in the blood or by intracellular digestion of the bacteria. Oxygen and sulfide are both transported by the hemoglobins. These proteins are freely dissolved in their blood or in the coelomic fluid surrounding the blood vessels. The hemoglobins in Siboglinids are thus essential not only to breathe, but also to fuel their endosymbionts and to cope with the toxic elements from their environment. The structures of these hemoglobin molecules are dealt with in this study. The hemoglobin has been extensively studied in Riftia pachyptila (Jones 1981 ) the giant tubeworm first discovered around the East Pacific hydrothermal vents. Riftia harbors three extracellular hemoglobins: two dissolved in its blood and one in its coelomic fluid (Arp et al., 1990; Zal et al., 1996a) . The largest vascular hemoglobin is a molecule of 3500 kDa visible in electron microscopy as two stacked hexagons of 24.5 nm diameter by 16 nm height (Terwilliger 1980; Zal et al., 1996b) . This type of hemoglobin is common in many annelids (Green et al., 2001 ) and was first called ""erythrocruorin"" according to its red color. The commonly admitted ""bracelet model"" consists of a hexagonal-bilayer hemoglobin (abbreviated HBL-Hb) made of 144 functional globin chains and 36 structural linker chains (Zal et al., 1996b) . However, whereas most annelids have the extracellular HBL-Hb only, Riftia has two other extracellular hemoglobins: a second vascular hemoglobin and also a coelomic hemoglobin, both having a molecular weight of 400 kDa, although they differ in their subunit composition and are consequently different molecules (Zal et al., 1996b) . The 400 kDa Hb are molecules measuring about one third the diameter of the HBL-Hb, looking like small circular rings on TEM microphotographs, and will therefore be named ring-Hb in the present study. In Riftia, all three hemoglobins are able to bind oxygen and sulfides, but none to such large amounts as the HBL-Hb (Zal et al., 1997) with 144 oxygen binding sites per protein. HBL-Hb binds both oxygen and sulfide reversibly, but at distinct sites of the molecule, avoiding both poisoning of the worm from free sulfides and spontaneous reaction between the two molecules (Arp et al., 1987; Zal et al., 1998) . In other vestimentifera species, such as Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata which live in cold-seep areas of the East-Pacific ocean, both types of hemoglobins have also been discovered (Terwilliger et al., 1985) . In Lamellibrachia from the seeps off Sagami bay in Japan, the HBL-Hb is about 3000 kDa, with four different hemecontaining-chains i.e. globin chains (Suzuki et al., 1993 ) (A1-AIV) and two different linker chains (AV and AVI) for the assembly of the globin chains (Suzuki et al., 1988) . The second Hb is a ring-Hb about 440 kDa built of only four globin chains (Suzuki et al., 1993) . The primary sequence of the N-terminal part of the ring-Hb shows 76 to 85% homology between various Lamellibrachia species suggesting they are closely related (Suzuki et al., 1993) . Frenulata tubeworms' small size makes blood analyses difficult, although it has been known for a long time that they contain hemoglobin (Southward and Southward, 1963) . Terwilliger and colleagues (Terwilliger et al., 1987) examined the hemoglobin in live specimens of six frenulata species. All six species had a hemoglobin of about 350-400 kDa, as shown by size exclusion chromatography and gel electrophoresis (Terwilliger et al., 1987) . This led Terwilliger and colleagues to conclude that pogonophora (at least the frenulata pogonophora) lack annelid HBL-Hb, but only harbor the ring-Hb that they share with the vestimentifera. Thus, the presence of the ring-Hb would be a synapomorphy of siboglinids. The ring-Hb of the frenulata Oligobrachia mashikoi that lives buried in the sediment from Tsukumo Bay in Japan has been studied extensively. Its globin chains share 35-52% identity with HBL-Hb from Lumbricus, Tylorhynchus and Lamellibrachia suggesting a close relationship between annelida, pogonophora and vestimentifera (Yuasa et al., 1996) . Nagakawa and colleagues sequenced the full length of four kinds of globin chains (A1, A2, B1 and B2) from Oligobrachia mashikoi. The structure of its molecule has been crystallized, and shows the ring-Hb as being hollow-spherical, and composed of a total of 24 globins associated as a dimer of dodecamers (Numoto et al., 2005; Numoto et al., 2006; Numoto et al., 2008) . The present work investigates the structure of the hemoglobins from two pogonophora species from the deep-sea cold seeps off Norway, aiming to compare their structural characteristics with those of other annelids, and to discuss the molecular and phylogenetic implications.  Specimens of the monilifera Sclerolinum contortum and of the frenulata Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis i.e. webbi Brattegard, 1966 (Brattegard 1966 , (I. Smirnov and S. Galkin personal communication, July 2007) were collected during the oceanographic cruise ""VICKING"" (May and June 2006) from the flanks of Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV), located on the northwestern coast of Norway (72°N-14.5°E) at 1200 m depth. Specimens belonging to the two same species were sampled at the discrete cold seep sites of Storegga flange (65°N-4.5°E), at 750 m depths. At each site, the submersible ""VICTOR 6000"" from the French research vessel ""Pourquoi-pas?"" dug the tubeworms from the sediment using blade cores. Upon recovery, the tubeworms were extracted from the mud by flushing seawater through a 1 mm sieve. The tubes measured about 250 µm and 500 µm in diameter, for Sclerolinum and Oligobrachia respectively. The recovered tube lengths for both species were from one to several decimeters, and sometimes exceeded 70 cm. Sclerolinum in particular could be much longer as it has a particularly twisted tube. The worms were taken from their tubes in ice-cold seawater, under an Olympus SZ9X stereo zoom binocular microscope. They were then pooled ten by ten in 0.5 ml centrifugal tubes stored on ice, and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for transportation to the laboratory, where they were kept frozen at −80°C. Other specimens still in their tubes were frozen directly ten by ten. We had 9 samples of ten individuals each for this study, distributed as three Oligobrachia samples: two from HMMV, and one from Storegga; six Sclerolinum samples: two from HMMV and four from Storegga, resulting in an analysis of 30 Oligobrachia and 60 Sclerolinum individuals. Each aliquot of 10 naked tubeworms were ground in 300 µL icecold saline buffer reproducing the composition of the physiological fluids in the siboglinids (400 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 32 mM MgSO 4 , 11 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM bis-tris-propane, pH 7.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14 000 g at 4°C for 10 min. The same protocol was used for tubeworms within their tubes. The proteins in the supernatant were separated by analytical size-exclusion chromatography performed on a high-resolution Superose 6 10/300 Tricorn (GL) column (GE Healthcare), with a fractionation range of 5 to 5000 kDa. Elution rate was 0.5 mL/min in saline buffer; the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm and 414 nm, to measure protein and heme concentration, respectively. The heme-containing protein were collected separately and concentrated on micro-centrifugal filter devices Centricon-10 (Millipore). Purity of the collected fractions was assessed with the same method. When required, one or two additional purification steps were performed using the same protocol to obtain purely isolated heme-containing protein fractions. To identify each purified heme-containing protein fraction, we determined their precise molecular mass by MALLS measurements using a DAWN EOS multi-angle detector system (Wyatt Technology Corp., USA) and a refractive index detector (Waters 2487), directly coupled to the SEC system described above. We obtained the precise molecular mass of each heme-containing protein by the software Astra 4.90.08 (Wyatt Technology Corp., USA) using the Debye fit method, with a dn/dc value set to 0.190 ml/g, typical of non-glycosylated proteins. The molecular shapes of the hemoglobins were observed by TEM, both on native blood and after purification of the hemoglobins. Blood drops, squeezed from the gill-tentacles of live specimens on board and diluted in saline buffer, were laid on carbon-film coated grids, and negatively stained in uranyl acetate (0.5%) according to (Valentine et al., 1968) . The same technique was performed for purified hemoglobin fractions. The grids were observed with a JEOL SX 1200 electron microscope, and photomicrographs were taken at ×50 000 and ×100 000 magnifications. The sizes of the Hb molecules were directly measured on the microphotographs. An ESI-MS analysis was performed on each purified hemoglobin type from each tubeworm species and from each collection site. Purified hemoglobin samples were extensively desalted in de-ionized water by successive concentration-dilution cycles using 10 kDa Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) and then lyophilized. ESI-MS analyses were performed in denaturing conditions. Each sample was dissolved at a final concentration of proteins about 0.5 mg/ml in a water/ acetonitrile/formic acid mix (50:50:0.2 volume). Analyses were performed on a microTOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and acquisition was performed over the 600-3000 m/z range. The nebulization gas pressure was 0.3 bar, drying gas flow was 3 L min − 1 , the capillary exit voltage was set to 160 V. Calibration was performed using myoglobin (Sigma-Aldrich). Mass spectra were deconvoluted using maximum entropy deconvolution (Bruker Data Analysis v3.2 software). Assuming that the globin chains have similar behavior during ionization process (see Results Section 3.3), abundances were estimated by normalizing each peak height by the height of the most intense peak. Since analyses were performed on pools of 10 individuals, the compared masses and abundances can reasonably be taken into account to hypothesize differences between samples.  The analysis by size-exclusion chromatography of Sclerolinum samples resulted in the elution of four peaks of heme-containing proteins, whereas Oligobrachia samples produced only three (Fig. 1A, B) . We analyzed then each purified peak separately, using both MALLS and TEM to identify each fraction by its molecular mass and quaternary structure. The peaks (II) were clearly the most abundant hemoglobin fraction in each species. In Sclerolinum the area of peak (III) was about half the area of peak (II), meaning that component (III) is about half as abundant as the major component (II). SEC, MALLS and TEM results were similar for both sampling sites: Storegga and HMMV. In Sclerolinum, MALLS estimated the mass of the major fraction (II) to 3190 ± 50 kDa (n = 97 slices), corresponding to the typical mass of an HBL-Hb ( Fig. 2A) , whereas fraction (III) had a molecular mass of about 461 ± 46 kDa (n = 97 slices) corresponding to the expected 400 kDa mass of a ring-Hb. Their quaternary structures observed by TEM confirmed the hexagonal bilayer structure and the ring structure respectively, and are shown below (Section 3.2 and Fig. 3 ). Oligobrachia major fraction (II) had a mass of 409 ± 3.7 kDa (n = 97 slices) corresponding to a ring-Hb structure (Figs. 2B, 3) . On the contrary, the minor peaks I analyzed by MALLS showed that the average molecular mass of the molecules in the first eluted fraction (I) in Sclerolinum and Oligobrachia were variable and always greater than 10 MDa. Observed under TEM the corresponding proteins of each fraction (I) resemble large white flakes more or less clustered together (data not shown). Their very high masses and their lack of homogeneous structure allowed us to conclude that these fractions (I) corresponded to various aggregates containing hemoglobin macromolecules in each species. Finally, the minor peak (IV) in Sclerolinum showed a mass of 63.8 ± 2 kDa (n = 241 slices), which corresponds to globin tetramers, issued from hemoglobin multimeres dissociation. The very small last peak (III) of Oligobrachia eluted even later than the globin tetramers for Sclerolinum, and is thus likely to be smaller degradation products appearing during the purification steps of the hemoglobin. The comparison of native and purified hemoglobin molecules is shown in Fig. 3 . Sclerolinum contained both hexagonal-bilayer Fig. 1 . Compared SEC profiles on whole tubeworm extracts. A -The purified total extracts of Sclerolinum showed four peaks of heme-containing proteins, from which the second peak was the major fraction (II). B -The chromatogram of Oligobrachia showed only three peaks, with the second being the major fraction (II) that had almost the same elution time as fraction (III) of Sclerolinum, indicating their very close molecular masses. structures (HBL-Hb) and the small ring-shaped molecules (ring-Hb) in its blood (Fig. 3A) . Purification of the major fraction (II) from Sclerolinum led to the isolation of the HBL-Hb (Fig. 3B) , whereas the fraction (III) corresponded to the small ring-shaped molecules (Fig. 3D) . Oligobrachia native blood/coelomic fluid contained only the small ring-shaped molecules (Fig. 3C ) that looked very similar to those of Sclerolinum after purification (Fig. 3D) . The blood of the vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia pachyptila contains both HBL-Hb and small ring-shaped molecules (Fig. 3E) , whereas the blood of the intertidal lugworm Arenicola marina contains HBL-Hb only (Fig. 3F) . Size measurements of Sclerolinum HBL-Hb on TEM photomicrographs gave a diameter of 22.8 nm ± 2.9 nm (n = 31), and a thickness of 16.4 nm ± 1.2 nm (n = 26). The precise masses of the different hemoglobins constituents were obtained by ESI-MS (Fig. 4) . The table is an overview of the composition and subunit masses of the hemoglobins for the two species from both sites taken together. Sclerolinum exhibited a broad range of molecular masses with seven different monomeric chains in the HBL-Hb, six of which are also present in the ring-Hb (Table 1) . The monomer masses range from 15 693 to 16 592 Da, which is consistent with the expected mass for globin chains. Three covalently bound dimers were also present in both HBL-Hb and ring-Hb. They were made of the globin b-chain associated to one of three different globin chains. All dimer constituents were present as monomers, except for the ring-Hb in which the b-chain was only observed in heterodimers. Finally three different linker chains were observed in the HBL-Hb. Although the ring-Hb of Sclerolinum is composed of the same globins and dimers as its HBL-Hb, the hypotheses that its ring-Hb could be an artifact, i.e. a degradation product of its HBL-Hb during storage or purification of the sample, can be ruled out because of the presence of ring-Hb in freshly collected blood, as observed under TEM (Fig. 3A) . In addition, the profiles obtained for SEC purification corresponds to those seen for Riftia blood after storage of the sample, and showing a higher amount of HBL-Hb than of ring-Hb, whereas the degradation products are very minor fractions (Zal et al., 1996a) . Oligobrachia ring-Hb had three different globin monomers only. No covalent dimer was observed. Linker chains enabling the association into a hexagonal bilayer were not present. To go into finer structural details we compared the relative abundances of each monomeric globin chains in Sclerolinum hemoglobins according to its collection site, using the normalized height of deconvoluted ESI-MS peaks (Fig. 5) . Abundance data must generally be considered with care since a discrepancy between the ESI-MS estimated values and the real ones could exist, due to different behaviors of the subunits during the ionization process. However we compare the abundance of each kind of globin chain from the hemoglobins of Sclerolinum from one site with the same globin chain (i.e. of identical mass) from the other site, and thus these chains should behave identically during ionization. When comparing globin chains of different masses within a sample, we assume that very closely related globin molecules are likely to behave similarly during the ionization process. The compared monomeric globin abundances in Sclerolinum look quite similar between the two hemoglobin types at each collection site: in particular chain-a is the most abundant globin chain in both HBL-Hb from each site. However some differences do exist: chain-b that is always present in HBL-Hb was not observed in the ring-Hb from either sites, chain-e was not present in the ring-Hb from Storegga monilifera, and no chain-f was observed in neither ring-Hb nor HBL-Hb from Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano monilifera.  The analyses of the hemoglobins in the two species of ""pogonophora"" siboglinids from the Norwegian cold seeps show that the monilifera Sclerolinum contortum has two types of extracellular hemoglobin: an HBL-Hb and a ring-Hb, just as the vestimentifera, whereas the frenulata Oligobrachia webbi has a ring-Hb only, as the remaining species of frenulata investigated so far (Terwilliger et al., 1987; Numoto et al., 2005) . It is the first time that an HBL-Hb is described in a ""pogonophora"" or non-vestimentiferan siboglinid. Monilifera comprise a single genus: Sclerolinum, with to date seven nominal species. As these worms are tiny (less than 0.5 mm in diameter) and often live in environments that are not easily accessible, few of them have been investigated so far for molecular studies. Our study adds a new Sclerolinum species to the list of molecular investigations. The discovery of HBL-Hb in Sclerolinum as in vestimentifera is interesting in an evolutionary point of view, as it corroborates morphological cladistic analysis (Rouse 2001) and several molecular studies (Halanych 2005) showing that among siboglinids, monilifera are more closely related to vestimentifera than to frenulata (Fig. 6 ). It would be interesting to check what type of hemoglobin is present in the other frenulata genera that have not been investigated so far, as also in the bone siboglinid Osedax, to further assess the evolutionary relationships within siboglinids. It is known that the extracellular hemoglobins have selfassembling properties. HBL-Hb and ring-Hb are built of the same type of elemental globins (sometimes even the same globins, in the case of Sclerolinum) associated in various multimeric forms. The only structural difference between ring-Hb and HBL-Hb is the presence of linkers to build the two-tiered hexagonal shape of the HBL-Hb. This huge molecule (or the related green hexagonal bilayer chlorocruorin Chl-Hb) is present in about 15 annelid families, from quite diverse clades: both tube-dwelling and active burrowers, including clitellata. Conversely to the widespread HBL-Hb, the ring-Hb is only reported from siboglinids. Within siboglinids, both HBL-Hb and ring-Hb are present in vestimentifera and monilifera, whereas frenulata (as least the 8 species investigated so far, from which the genera Diplobrachia, Siboglinida and Oligobrachia.) have the ring-Hb only. Current phylogenetic hypotheses are consensual about the basal positions of the frenulata in the siboglinid tree (Rouse et al., 2004; Halanych 2005) . The parsimonious hypothesis would thus imply that frenulata must have lost the ability to synthesize HBL-Hb, due to missing linkers. It would be interesting to check their genome to see, whether frenulata have silent linker genes, or whether the linker genes are lacking. This question could also be addressed for polychetes that do not have HBL, but other types of hemoglobin such as intracellular Hb, to help elucidate the evolutionary history of heme proteins. Measured with MALLS having a precision of about 5%, Sclerolinum HBL-Hb is 3190 ± 50 kDa, a mass that fits within the range of HBL-Hb masses determined by various techniques (Hanin et al., 2003) . It is a slightly smaller mass than the 3500 kDa determined by MALLS for the HBL-Hb in the vestimentifera Riftia pachyptila (Zal et al., 1996b) . Measured under TEM, Sclerolinum HBL-Hb has a size of 22.8 × 16.4 nm that is not far from those of the vestimentifera Riftia pachyptila 24.5 × 16 nm (Terwilliger 1980) , and slightly smaller than the non siboglinid polychete Arenicola marina 30.0 × 19.7 nm (Toulmond et al., 1990) . Oligobrachia ring-Hb has a molecular mass of 409 ± 3.7 kDa, and Sclerolinum is 460 ± 46 kDa. These sizes are comparable to those of the 400-kDa hemoglobin evidenced in other pogonophora (Terwilliger et al., 1987; Numoto et al., 2005) . The two ring-Hb masses in Riftia are 433 kDa for the vascular V2 and 380 kDa for the coelomic C1 (Zal et al., 1996b) . In spite of slightly varying masses from species to species, due to sequence variations in their monomeric components, these hemoglobins show quaternary structures that appear as similar ring-shaped structures, when observed under TEM. However, the crystal structures of the 400 kDa Hb from Lumbricus, Riftia and Oligobrachia mashikoi clearly show four kinds of globins. They are Fig. 3 . Compared TEM views of the extracellular Hemoglobin molecules. A -Native blood/coelomic fluid from the monilifera Sclerolinum taken at HMMV contained both HBL-Hb (arrow-head on profile view) and smaller ring-shaped units (thin arrow). B -SEC purified fraction (II) of Sclerolinum from Storegga seeps showing the typical hexagonal bilayer structure (HBL-Hb), mostly seen in apical view, but also in profile (arrowhead). C -Native blood/coelomic fluid of the frenulata Oligobrachia from HMMV filled with concentrated ring-shaped hemoglobin (thin arrows). D -SEC purified fraction (III) of Sclerolinum from HMMV showed similar small ring-Hb molecules. E -Native blood of the vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia pachyptila from the hydrothermal vents along the East Pacific Rise contained both HBL-Hb (arrow-head on profile view) and 400 kDa ring-hemoglobins (thin arrows). F -Native blood from the intertidal burrowing lugworm Arenicola marina has HBL-Hb only. Scale bar in each figure is 50 nm. associated as disulfide-bonded dimers or trimers that in fact are assembled as a bi-dodecameric globular and hollow-spherical structure (Numoto et al., 2005) . This dodecameric assemblage would be the fundamental structural unit of both 400 kDa Hb and 3500 kDa Hb (Numoto et al., 2005) . On the other hand, Oligobrachia 400 kDa Hb in the present study has three kinds of globins, with no disulfide-bonded dimers, nor trimers. It would therefore be very interesting to look at the structure of its crystal to determine whether it is also associated as a bi-dodecamer, or if its structure is somehow different from the other annelids investigated so far. Sclerolinum HBL-Hb is composed of seven monomeric globin chains, two sulfide-bonded globin dimers and three linker-chains. Comparatively Riftia HBL-Hb has only two monomeric globins, a single dimer and four types of linkers (Zal et al., 1996a) . Lamellibrachia HBL-Hb has the opposite proportion: four monomeric globin chains and two linkers (Suzuki et al., 1988) . None of the globin masses determined here were identical to those recorded for HBL-Hb sub-units in any other annelid, measured with the same method (Bruneaux et al., 2008) . The diversity of globins appears much greater in Sclerolinum than in vestimentifera. However part of this diversity could be due to glycosylation of some of them, as shown in Riftia, for which the lightest globin chain (a) has five different glycosylation states (a1-a5) (Zal et al., 1996a) . Further deglycosylation experiments can be performed when more samples are available. Fig. 4 . Deconvoluted ESI-MS spectra of the HBL-Hb in Sclerolinum. The sample was analyzed in denaturing conditions and the obtained spectra were deconvoluted using maximum entropy. A -Deconvoluted spectrum in the 15 000-35 000 Da range. B -Spectrum zoomed in the globin monomer mass range. C -Spectrum zoomed in the globin dimer mass range. For the three spectra, masses are indicated in Da, and the name of the peak refers to the notation used in the Table. For some monomers, a signal corresponding to a heme adduct was observed, and is indicated by the letter (h). The nomenclature is that of the mass spectra in denaturing conditions (see Fig. 4 ). The presence of globin dimers in Sclerolinum HBL-Hb seems to be a feature that monilifera share with the vestimentifera species analyzed so far. Among annelids, globin dimers are also present in the HBL-Hb of clitellata (except Lumbricus (Martin et al., 1996) ), as in the HBL-Hb of the polychete sabellids and in the orbiniid Methanoaricia dendrobranchiata from brine pool seeps. Most of the other polychete families have globin trimers, for review see Bruneaux et al. (2008) . Fig. 5 . ESI-MS estimated abundances of monomeric globin subunits in Sclerolinum Hemoglobins. The intensity for each deconvoluted peak was normalized against the intensity of the highest peak of the spectrum. Globins are sorted and named by increasing molecular mass (see Table 1 and Fig. 4) . Sclerolinum ring-Hb is composed of the same globin monomers and dimers as the HBL-Hb, except for the chain b present in the dimer only, but not as a free monomer. Thus, the chain b seems to be compulsory for the formation of dimers both in Sclerolinum HBL-Hb and in ring-Hb. Concerning ring-Hb, Riftia has two kinds: one in the vascular system (V2) and one in the coelomic fluid (C1). Both have globin chains of very similar molecular masses, although V2 has 6 globins, and C1 only 5, lacking the globin of lightest molecular mass (Zal et al., 1996a) . The very small size of Sclerolinum does not enable do dissect the blood system from the coelomic compartments, to determine the precise localization of HBL-Hb and ring-Hb in the body fluids. Riftia vascular ring-Hb also exhibits great globin diversity with six globin chains, from which four are also present in its HBL-Hb (Zal et al., 1996a) . This means that the two hemoglobin types differ much more in Riftia than in Sclerolinum, where HBL-Hb and ring-Hb are built by the same globin chains and differ only by the presence of linker chains in the HBL-Hb. The comparison of relative globin monomers abundances in Sclerolinum hemoglobins between the two collection sites tends to show that globin chain-a of lightest molecular weight is the most represented in both ring-Hb and HBL-Hb from both sites. On the contrary chain-b is lacking as monomer in the ring-Hb at all sites (but is present in the dimers). Globin chain-f is lacking in the tubeworms' hemoglobins from HMMV, as also chain-e in the ring-Hb from Storegga. These structural differences in the hemoglobins from Sclerolinum tubeworms collected at either site could reflect genetic differences between distinct populations, which are geographically distant from several hundred kilometers. Local environmental factors may also influence the gene expression and its resulting physiological outcome within unique species, such as shown previously in the two ecotypes of Ridgiea piscesae (Carney et al., 2007) . The consequences of the structural differences on the function of the molecule, as to its oxygen affinity are currently under analysis.",Cédric Meunier,2010,19770067,10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.09.010
24236881,Microbial methane cycling in a terrestrial mud volcano in eastern Taiwan,"Summary ::: ::: Microbial communities responsible for methane cycling in mud volcanoes onshore are poorly characterized. This study analysed bubbling fluids and cored sediments retrieved from a mud volcano in eastern Taiwan. The pore water profiles revealed that methane concentrations generally increased with depth and changed dramatically at different depth intervals at different sites. The methane concentrations were inversely correlated with Fe2+/Mn2+ concentrations and δ13C values of methane, marking iron/manganese-methane transition zones in the sediment cores. Archaeal communities were dominated by ANME-2a members and methylotrophic methanogens, whereas bacterial communities consisted primarily of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of ANME-2a and Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter populations varied by two to three orders of magnitude along the profile and exhibited a pattern comparable with those of Fe2+ and δ13C values of methane. These lines of evidence suggest a coupling between anaerobic methanotrophy and metal reduction in the metal-methane transition zones under sulfate-deficient conditions, a metabolic scheme contrasting with that observed in marine cold seeps. Anaerobic methanotrophs proliferate by removing methane produced from in situ methanogenesis and originating from the deep source. Methane finally emitted into the atmosphere is quantitatively and isotopically altered by various microbial processes compartmentalized at different depth intervals.",N/A,Yung-Hsin Chang,2012,22141749,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02658.x

Cells of strain SM250T were Gram-negative non-spore forming motile straight rods. Growth was observed at temperatures 30–63 °C (optimum at 50 °C), pH 6.5–10.0 (optimum at pH 8.5) and NaCl concentrations 0–4.5% (w/v) (optimum at 1.0–1.5% (w/v)). The novel isolate grows by aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Strain SM250T grows by the utilization of methanol, formate and a number of other organic compounds or lithoautotrophically with hydrogen, elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as electron donors. The total size of the genome of the novel isolate was 3,327,116 bp and a genomic DNA G + C content was 64.8 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain SM250T belongs to the class Hydrogenophilia within the phylum Proteobacteria, with less than 91% of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to any species with validly published name. We propose to assign strain SM250T to a new species of a novel genus Pelomicrobium methylotrophicum gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is SM250T (= KCTC 62861T = VKM B-3274T).",,G.

4984670,Mud extrusion and ring-fault gas seepage – upward branching fluid discharge at a deep-sea mud volcano,"Submarine mud volcanoes release sediments and gas-rich fluids at the seafloor via deeply-rooted plumbing systems that remain poorly understood. Here the functioning of Venere mud volcano, on the Calabrian accretionary prism in ~1,600 m water depth is investigated, based on multi-parameter hydroacoustic and visual seafloor data obtained using ship-borne methods, ROVs, and AUVs. Two seepage domains are recognized: mud breccia extrusion from a summit, and hydrocarbon venting from peripheral sites, hosting chemosynthetic ecosystems and authigenic carbonates indicative of long-term seepage. Pore fluids in freshly extruded mud breccia (up to 13 °C warmer than background sediments) contained methane concentrations exceeding saturation by 2.7 times and chloride concentrations up to five times lower than ambient seawater. Gas analyses indicate an underlying thermogenic hydrocarbon source with potential admixture of microbial methane during migration along ring faults to the peripheral sites. The gas and pore water analyses point to fluids sourced deep (>3 km) below Venere mud volcano. An upward-branching plumbing system is proposed to account for co-existing mud breccia extrusion and gas seepage via multiple surface vents that influence the distribution of seafloor ecosystems. This model of mud volcanism implies that methane-rich fluids may be released during prolonged phases of moderate activity.","Mud volcanoes (MVs) are geological structures created by the extrusion of sediments, water, and volatiles (predominantly methane) from subsurface plumbing systems that may extend to depths of kilometres [1] [2] [3] [4] . Therefore, terrestrial MVs represent a significant natural source of atmospheric methane with emissions estimated to range from 6 to 12.6 Tg/year 5, 6 . The jointly expelled solids and fluids are referred to as mud breccia and over time the extrusion of mud breccia can build morphological edifices up to hundreds of meters in height that cover areas of up to several square kilometres 7 . Observations of terrestrial MVs suggest that mud volcanism is episodic, with periods of quiescence that may represent up to 95% of the lifetime of a MV, interrupted by brief eruptions (hours to days) 3, 7, 8 . Quiescent MV activity is typically characterized by the expulsion of mud and fluids from small cones (<10 m high) or fluid-mud pools and gas seeps 8 . These features may be linked to extensional faults within the extrusive edifice, in some cases defining sub-circular calderas thought to result from post-eruptive subsidence 9 . Less is known about the expressions of activity (quiescent or eruptive) of submarine MVs although estimates of their number (up to 10 5 ) exceed that of onshore MVs by up to two orders of magnitude 5, 10 . In the Black Sea, seepage from active MVs is associated with warm sediments ascending from depth and upward flow of aqueous fluids and free gas 11, 12 . At the Håkon Mosby MV (Norway), variations in fluid flow have been found to trigger mud movements and outflows that changed the seafloor morphology and released up to 43000 m 3 of methane 13, 14 . Deep-sea MVs are often associated with the presence of shallow gas hydrates 12, 15 and are known to sustain ). To move forward in the understanding of these interrelated issues requires systematic investigations of submarine MV systems to detect the sites of seepage relative to MV morphologies, quantify the fluid discharge, and characterize the composition of fluids emitted at and in the vicinity of the locations of active mud extrusion. MVs occur globally in a variety of plate tectonic settings, but are most common along convergent margins within accretionary prisms 3, 4, 17 . The eastern and central Mediterranean regions host an exceptionally high density of MVs 18 the majority of which are located within the accretionary settings of the Africa-Eurasia subduction zone. Major MV provinces have been identified on the Calabrian accretionary prism (CAP), the Mediterranean Ridge, the Anaximander Mountains, and the Nile deep sea fan (Fig. 1a   18 ). On the Mediterranean Ridge, scientific drilling of two MVs 19 revealed mud breccia discharge processes 20 and a fluid source depth of ~3.5-7 km 21 . In the Anaximander Mountains region, gas release at MVs supports the formation of shallow gas hydrates 22 , which have been found to be prone to decomposition during eruptive phases of mud volcanism 15 . Investigations of MVs on the Nile deep sea fan documented mud outflows and fluid seepage at submarine brine pools 23, 24 . The presence of brine indicated migration from below and through fault-ruptured Messinian evaporite layers 24 . In the main sediment basins of the eastern Mediterranean, however, Messinian salt deposits are thought to act as seals to fluids ascending from depth. The MV provinces have in turn been found to predominantly occur where salt deposits are absent, thin, or undetected in seismic data 18 . At least 54 extrusive features have been documented across the inner regions of the Calabrian accretionary prism 25 (CAP; Fig. 1a ). This includes Venere MV located in the Crotone basin (Fig. 1b) at ~1,600 m of water depth along the axis of the Squillace canyon (Fig. 1c) . Systematic hydroacoustic surveys across at least 50 extrusive features previously recognized by Ceramicola et al. 25 were performed in November and December 2014 (R/V METEOR cruise M112 26 ). Evidence of active gas emissions into the water column (gas flares) and mud breccia outflows were found only at Venere MV 27 . A recent study on the extrusive history of Venere MV presented  ) in the E Mediterranean Sea (MR = Mediterranean Ridge, A = Anaximander Mountains, NDSF = Nile Deep Sea Fan); (b) Main morpho-structural zones of the CAP and boundaries after Ceramicola et al. 25 (see a) for extent; CE = Calabrian Escarpment); (c) Distribution of MVs (after Ceramicola et al. 25 on the internal wedge and forearc basins (see b) for extent) including Venere MV; (d) NE to SW profile across the Crotone basin showing the geological context of the study area.

SCiEntifiC RePoRTS | (2018) 8:6275 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24689-1 evidence of mud breccia discharge for at least the last 800 years at rates as high as 47000 m 3 /year, suggesting a long-term pressurized state of the MV system 27 . These findings contrast with the typical view of short-lived massive mud breccia extrusions interrupting long-term quiescent-type seepage. They require a more detailed study of the present-day activity of Venere MV, including potential fluid sources. 3.2b; www.qps.nl). Note twin cones labelled as E + W summit, each up to 100 m high and ring faults defining a caldera up to 3 km across. Water column gas flares (red to yellow colours; extracted from hydroacoustic data) up to 260 m in height were observed at five sites, along the peripheral ring faults (Sites 1, 2, 4, 5) and near the W summit (Site 3); (b) Map-view of Venere MV (see Fig. 1 for extent) with inset of the extrusion site of the fresh mudflow at the W summit (generated in ESRI ArcMap 10.3.1; www.esri.com). Red stars mark the flare origins and white circles indicate sampling locations with white numbers referring to the last two GeoB-identifiers (see Table 1 and supplementary Tables S1 and S2 for In this study the nature of activity at a submarine MV is investigated, based on a multi-method approach involving hydroacoustic and visual seafloor datasets acquired by AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) and ROV (remotely operated vehicle) surveys, seafloor sediment samples, gas samples collected under in-situ pressure, and fluid analyses. The multi-parameter datasets are used to study processes involved in active mud volcanism. The processes that drive mud volcanism typically occur at depths not readily accessible for direct sampling, thus the results allow for inferences on crustal dewatering and hydrocarbon generation at depth within the CAP. Element and fluid cycling and contribution of elements to the hydrosphere, which may be applicable to other convergent margins are discussed. Finally, the findings of this study support a new conceptual model involving coeval mud breccia extrusion, faulting and gas seepage, in which subsurface fluid migration pathways are linked to different expressions of seafloor fluid discharge and ecosystem distribution. The present-day CAP in the central Mediterranean Sea (Fig. 1a) developed from the NW subduction of the African plate (an Ionian lithospheric slab) below the Eurasian plate during the Neogene 28, 29 . The incorporation of evaporites resulting from the Messinian salinity crisis (late Miocene) into the accretionary prism strongly influenced the structure of the CAP. The CAP can be divided into an external (post-Messinian) wedge that hosts evaporites and an internal (pre-Messinian) wedge hosting mainly clastic sediments affected by out-of-sequence thrusts, the most prominent of which is referred to as the Calabrian Escarpment (CE; Fig. 1b 30-32 ). The internal wedge is composed of accreted Mesozoic-Cenozoic units overlain by forearc basins (Spartivento-Crotone basins 25, [30] [31] [32] [33] ). Late Pleistocene uplift has resulted in exposure of the inner parts of the forearc basins in southern Calabria, where sediments date back to the middle Miocene (late Serravallian) and contain Messinian deposits including <200 m-thick evaporites within the onshore Crotone forearc basin 34, 35 and in nearshore wells 36 . Seismic reflection profiles of the offshore forearc basins indicate up to 2 km of sediment, overlying thrust structures ( Fig. 1d 31,32,37,38 ). These sequences are inferred to also date back to the Tortonian and to contain Messinian deposits [30] [31] [32] 36 . However, the sedimentological composition of these deposits -i.e. whether they contain evaporites -remains unknown. The majority of the 54 MVs so far identified in the CAP are located across the internal (pre-Messinian) accretionary prism, within the forearc basins and among the thrust-fold belt to seaward 25 . MVs in both tectonic settings are argued to have been erupting since ca. 3.5 Ma (early Pliocene), based on seismic profiles across two structures. These two MVs are associated with buried extrusive edifices over 1 km thick that interfinger with the upper part of the Plio-Quaternary succession 2 . The geometries of these and other MVs have been argued to reflect the interaction of fluids rising from within the prism with near-surface structures, including thrusts beneath the forearc basins 2, 25 . Mud breccia from several MVs contained sediment derived from strata ranging in age from Recent to as old as Late Cretaceous, consistent with sources at depth within the accretionary prism 2, 38, 39 . Most MVs are associated with seafloor backscatter signatures interpreted to indicate mud breccia outflows over the last glacial to interglacial cycle 25 . Evidence of presently ongoing fluid release on the CAP is limited, however, to reports of sediment cores releasing gas and findings of small tubeworms in a single core 40 . Previous studies of MVs on the CAP lack a quantification of the gas or characterization of the involved fluids. Cold seep ecosystems represent important ecological hotspots in the Mediterranean Sea but they are still poorly known on the CAP. The seafloor morphology of Venere MV is imaged in detail by AUV-borne swath bathymetric data with a horizontal resolution of up to 1.6 m (Fig. 2 ). Bathymetric observations reveal that Venere MV consists of an eastern and a western summit ~1,200 m apart (Fig. 2a,b) , rising up to 100 m above the surrounding seafloor. The twin cones are cut by concentric sets of inward-dipping scarps with surface slopes of 18-45°, which define a circular feature centered ~700 m SE of the western summit (Fig. 2) . The scarps are visible as discontinuous morphological Table 1 . GeoB-identifier, sampling tool, location (WGS84), and water depth of stations for gravity cores and samples of gas analyses (see Fig. 2 for positions) with molecular hydrocarbon ratios (C 1 /C 2+ , C 2 /C 3 ), stable C isotope signatures (δ At the western cone (~1,500 m water depth), elongate mudflow deposits are observed extending for horizontal distances of up to ~1,600 m down the southern flank to the foot of the cone (~1620 m water depth; Fig. 2 ). This most recent mud breccia outflow deposit was investigated via ROV observations (Fig. 3a,b) and sampling at the western cone (Fig. 2) . A fresh mudflow originates from the top of the summit (inset Fig. 2 ), observed as a slightly elevated horseshoe-shaped feature about 3 m across with a central depression (Fig. 3b) . Exposed mud breccia deposits showed a blocky structure that lacked the hemipelagic sedimentary cover visible on adjacent flows (Fig. 3a) . At the eastern cone, bathymetric observations reveal elongate but smooth lobes (Fig. 2) , consistent with less recent extrusive activity. This is supported by a sediment core from the eastern summit (GeoB19234-1; Fig. 2 ), which contained mud breccia draped by several decimetres of hemipelagic sediment (see also Loher et al. 27 ). Hydroacoustic surveys conducted 28 times across Venere MV over a 31 day period during M112 revealed temporally variable but generally persistent gas discharge (flares) from five sites: one slightly below the western summit (Site 3) and four peripheral to the MV cones (Sites 1, 2, 4, and 5; Fig. 2 ). The flares were up to ~260 m high along the peripheral sites but only up to ~50 m high at the summit. The seafloor origins of the four peripheral gas flares (Sites 1, 2, 4, 5) coincide with surface traces of the ring-fault system (Fig. 2) . ROV explorations confirmed gas bubble emissions (Fig. 3c) at each of the sites. They were settled by chemosynthetic organisms and surrounded by mounds and pavements of authigenic carbonate several decimetres thick (Fig. 3c-e) . In contrast at Site 3, below the western summit, gas bubble emissions were not encountered during two ROV surveys. On the fresh mudflows and in surrounding areas draped by hemipelagic sediment no macroscopic indications of seepage (carbonates, chemosynthetic communities) were observed (Fig. 3a,b) . Thus no seep-related sediment samples could be collected from Site 3. Cores of mud breccia flowing down the flank of the western cone (Table 1, supplementary Table S2 ) contained rocks clasts to decimetre size in a mud matrix, typically characterized by sediment textures resulting from gas bubbles and pockets giving it a mousse-like appearance. Quantitative degassing of one of the pressure cores (DAPC, GeoB19251-1) yielded 41.3 L of gas from the 11220 cm 3 of sediment retrieved, which translated to a volumetric gas-sediment ratio of 3.68. In addition to methane (C 1 ), heavier hydrocarbons such as ethane (C 2 ) and propane (C 3 ) were detected in gas samples from the mud breccia, with traces of butane (C 4 ) and pentane (C 5 ; Table 1 ). The ratio of methane to higher hydrocarbons (C 1 /C 2+ ) in gas samples from the mud breccia ranged between 79 and 107. Methane (CH 4 ) constituted 98.5 vol-% of the total gas released from the pressure core and using an average sediment porosity of 0.5 (determined in samples from gravity core GeoB19245-1), the calculated average CH 4 concentration was 321 mmol/L pore water. This CH 4 concentration is about 2.7 times higher than the calculated in-situ CH 4 solubility (120 mmol/L pore water; temperature (T) at 2 mbsf = 31.33 °C; salinity (S) = 10 psu; following equations by Tishchenko et al. ). The stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of methane (δ 13 C-CH 4 ; δD-CH 4 ) ranged from −36.6 to −41.6‰ V-PDB and from −143.9 to −156.0‰ V-SMOW, respectively (Table 1) . Chloride concentrations in fluids extracted from mud breccia outflows at the extrusion site on the western summit, decreased from bottom water values of 618 mmol/L at the sediment surface to 128 mmol/L at 14 cmbsf (Fig. 4a) . Gravity core GeoB19245-1 from the extrusion site confirmed that low chlorinity fluids (125 mmol/L at minimum) extended down to 5 mbsf. Pore fluid samples in gravity cores and push cores obtained from peripheral seeps (Sites 1, 2, 4 and 5, Fig. 2 ) showed chloride concentrations within 4% of bottom water values to depths up to 2 mbsf (Fig. 4a) . All peripheral seeps hosted abundant chemosynthetic macrofauna and authigenic carbonate crusts (Fig. 3c-e) . These are indicative of a shallow zone of anaerobic methane oxidation, consistent with measured steep sulfate gradients and sulfate-methane transitions at depths of <25 cmbsf (Fig. 4b) . The discharged gas at peripheral seeps was composed primarily of methane but also contained ethane (C 2 ) and propane (C 3 ). Gas bubbles sampled at the peripheral seeps had C 1 /C 2+ ratios of 859-2249, with δ 13 C-CH 4 and δD-CH 4 ranging from −44.7 to −48.6‰ V-PDB and from −176.0‰ to −182.6 V-SMOW, respectively (Table 1) . In the mud breccia at the extrusion site (Fig. 2) the maximum temperature, measured at 40 cm above the tip of a 5 m gravity core barrel (GeoB19248-2), was 26.8 °C. This is 13 °C higher than average bottom water temperatures. In addition, sediment temperatures above 20 °C were repeatedly measured below 0.5 mbsf (meters below seafloor). The average of linear temperature gradients calculated for the mudflow at the extrusion site amounted to 8.76 °C/m (supplementary Table S1 ). Regardless of their crystal structure specific stability, gas hydrates would only be stable within 30 cm of the seafloor (supplementary Fig. S1 ). Averages of linear temperature gradients close to the gas emission sites at the peripheral seeps ranged from 0.15-0.20 °C/m (supplement Table S1 ). Using these gradients, the calculated base of the gas hydrate stability at the seeps is located 8-10 mbsf (supplement Fig. S1 ). Seafloor sampling of some of the seeps with the ROV resulted in the release of flake-like white particles (several mm in diameter) that rose into the water column, suggesting the subsurface presence of small amounts of gas hydrates, associated with seepage along the ring faults. The recent mud breccia outflows are rich in gas. In-situ methane concentrations exceeding CH 4 solubility by up to 2.7 times as determined for pressure cores imply that a large fraction of the pore space was still occupied by gaseous methane. High gas contents are also consistent with the mousse-like sediment textures observed in unpressurized cores. Using the classification by Whiticar 42 (supplementary Fig. S4a,b) , the molecular composition of and from peripheral seeps (circles). Locations of gravity cores GeoB19245-1 and GeoB19236-1 in Fig. 2 ; locations of push cores in supplementary Table S2 . Red stars show ambient bottom water concentrations of chloride (618 mmol/L) and sulfate (32 mmol/L), respectively; mbsf = meters below seafloor; data tables are provided in supplementary Tables S3-S13. hydrocarbons and isotopic compositions of methane (Table 1) , point to a thermogenic origin for the hydrocarbons transported within the mud breccia of Venere MV. Formation temperatures range from ~70 °C for the early thermogenic hydrocarbons to upwards of 150 °C for late thermogenic, methane-rich gas production systems [43] [44] [45] . Venere MV lies midway between geothermal gradients as low as 0.013 °C/m offshore and 0.024-0.030 °C/m onshore 46 . Using an average geothermal gradient of 0.020 °C/m at the location of Venere MV, and thermogenic temperatures of 70-150 °C, the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbons in the mud breccia outflows suggests a source located at least 3.5 km and potentially >7.5 km below seafloor. This depth range corresponds to empirically determined burial depths for source rocks within the thermogenic window (e.g. Quigley and Mackenzie 44 ). This does not preclude the occurrence of a pressurized reservoir trapping these gases at shallower depths (i.e. cooler temperatures) below Venere MV. Mud breccia at the western summit of Venere MV is also characterized by pore water freshening (Fig. 4a) . The magnitude of chloride depletion and the abrupt reduction within the uppermost 10 to 20 cmbsf document an upward advective aqueous component in the extruding mud. The continuously low chloride concentrations at depth indicate that the freshening is unlikely to be associated with gas hydrate decomposition, which would instead cause discrete low-chloride spikes (e.g. Torres et al. 47 ). An absence of gas hydrates at the western summit of Venere MV is consistent with measured sediment temperatures, which shift mud breccia at >30 cmbsf outside the gas hydrate stability zone (supplementary Fig. S1 ). Instead, the pore water profiles are consistent with extrusion of mud breccia containing fresh fluids sourced at depth, likely driven by mineral dehydration reactions, such as the transformation of smectite to illite, which takes place at temperatures between ~60 and 150 °C 48 . Pore-water freshening has also been observed in MVs on the Mediterranean Ridge, where the freshening has been attributed to mineral dehydration during smectite-illite transition at depths of 3.5-7 km 21 . At Venere MV, assuming a regional geothermal gradient of 0.02 °C/m (as above), the temperature range of 60-150 °C translates to fluid generation at 3-7.5 km, in accordance with the formation depths required by the thermogenic hydrocarbons. These results indicate that formation of thermogenic hydrocarbons and water release by mineral dehydration reactions led to the generation of the fluids that are associated to the mud breccia at Venere MV. These processes require temperatures ≥60 °C that, at the location of Venere MV, indicate source depths exceeding 3 km. These depths lie well below those of the inferred depth range of Messinian deposits interpreted to occur in the Crotone forearc basin (Fig. 1d  32 ) . On the CAP, MV sources have previously been inferred to underlie the forearc-basin sediments based on mud breccia compositions containing fossils and clasts derived from strata as old as Cretaceous 2, 38, 39 . It is unknown if Messinian deposits in the Crotone forearc basins contain evaporites, however, at Venere MV the mud breccia containing strongly freshened pore waters offers no evidence of interactions with Messinian evaporites during their rise from depth. One possibility is that Messinian deposits, if present in the sedimentary succession below the location of Venere MV, did not contain evaporites. This possibility is in accordance with other studies, which found that MVs in the eastern Mediterranean region preferably developed at sites where Messinian deposits are thin or absent 18, 25, 32, 36 or cut by deep-seated faults acting as fluid-migration pathways 18, 24 . Another option is that, over time, fluid migration through the plumbing system beneath Venere MV has removed any Messinian evaporites. Gas seepage and outflow of fluid-rich muds along MV ring-faults is known from studies on land and typically characterizes quiescent phases of MVs 8, 49 . However, the processes leading to the co-occurrence of quiescent-type activity and active mud breccia extrusions are not well understood. Based on observations of the prevailing seafloor morphologies and processes, and analyses of pore fluid (gas and water) compositions of samples from Venere MV, a conceptual model of its plumbing system is proposed that inter-relates extrusive processes, ring-faulting, fluid seepage and seafloor ecosystems (Fig. 5) . The rough surface structure of exposed mud breccia observed at and below the extrusion site (Fig. 3a,b ) together with the lack of sedimentary drape on the most recent mudflow indicate that these deposits are fresh. The lack of cold seep features (carbonate, chemosynthetic communities) is also consistent with a dynamic sedimentary environment. The high sediment temperatures measured within the extrusion site are also consistent with recent or even on-going extrusion, as are pore water profiles with steep sulfate gradients documenting the advection of sulfate-depleted mud (Fig. 4b) . Calculations of ascent rates of the mud breccia, based on the observed clast sizes (up to 10 cm), provide an order of magnitude estimate of 1. The deeply-rooting conduit inferred to rise beneath the western summit is encircled by inward-dipping ring-faults. Gas discharge at peripheral sites indicates that fluids are migrating along the faults. The peripheral seeps of Venere MV are so far the only sites on the CAP from which extensive chemosynthesis-based communities associated with gas emissions and authigenic carbonate deposits have been documented. These observations indicate a long-term upward supply of dissolved methane at Venere MV. The presence of decimetre-thick authigenic carbonates in particular indicate persistent gas seepage over timescales of thousands of years 27 . Considering the timing of mud breccia extrusions from the western cone (recent to on-going) and the quiescent-type gas release along the ring faults (long-term and on-going) it is argued that both processes have been occurring coevally. The development of the caldera at Venere MV has been proposed to result from the long-term extrusive activity involving material withdrawal from the subsurface and thus linking active mud volcanism to caldera subsidence involving ring-fault movements 27 . Faults bordering MV edifices are a known features of submarine MVs (e.g. Paull et al. 50 ). In a deep-marine environment, however, the high-resolution bathymetric dataset presented here reveals in unprecedented detail the seafloor expression of a ring-fault bounded caldera with sites of active SCiEntifiC RePoRTS | (2018) 8:6275 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24689-1 fluid release along it. The stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic signatures of methane collected at the peripheral seeps (Table 1) indicate a thermogenic methane source using the classification by Whiticar 42 (supplementary Fig. S4a ). This is in agreement with results obtained by Blumenberg et al. 51 who documented the presence of methane, ethane, and propane in gas from the peripheral seeps (Table 1) , and attributed a thermogenic origin for this gas. C 1 /C 2+ ratios determined for the gas, however, are higher than expected for hydrocarbons from an exclusive thermogenic source (see also supplementary Fig. S4b ). Several post-genetic processes can account for the molecular and isotopic relationships of hydrocarbons at the peripheral seeps: admixture of shallow microbial methane during fluid ascent; secondary microbial methane generation leading to drier gas with relatively more negative δ 13 C-CH 4 values 52, 53 ; and segregation effects during gas transport through porous, aqueous sediments 54 . Nevertheless, the gas discharging at the periphery of Venere MV clearly contains thermogenic hydrocarbons (C 2 and C 3 ; Table 1 ) as the mud breccia extruded through the main conduit at the western summit. It is therefore argued that the thermogenic fraction of the gas released at the peripheral seeps branched upward and laterally away from the main MV conduit (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, the ring faults act as natural migration pathways for gas but not for mud breccia. It appears that the overpressured gas undergoes upward divergence as it migrates through faults and microfractures of the ring-fault system. Similar lateral fluid migration has been previously proposed to occur at MVs, at depths where overpressured fluids experience lower surrounding pressures 4 . As shown for the sediment-hosted hydrothermal system of the Lusi site in Indonesia, divergent fluid migration along faults of collapsing calderas takes more time than focused flow along the main conduit 55 . This may result in changes in the composition of vented gases. At Venere MV, the longer distances and possibly slower flow of gas along the ring-fault system may have promoted the admixing of shallow microbial methane and contributed to changes in the gas molecular composition (Fig. 5) . Both admixture and migration processes typically contribute to an increase in the C 1 /C 2+ ratio and manifest through more negative δ 13 C-CH 4 values, as observed at gas emitted at the peripheral seeps (Table 1) . Mud volcanism in general is driven by the cyclic build-up of subsurface overpressure triggering the material release 56 . In the proposed model (Fig. 5) , the ring faults are argued to respond to variations in pore pressures linked to fluid pulses from the deeper plumbing system. During phases of high pore fluid pressures the ring faults facilitate the diversion of an overpressured gas phase to the periphery of the MV. In turn, variations in pore pressures may facilitate movement on the ring-faults (e.g. leading to caldera collapse). For most offshore MVs, their dynamics and variability of activity remain unknown. More quantitative information on fluid and sediment amounts involved is essential to constrain the global contribution of MVs to material fluxes at geosphere-hydrosphere interfaces. Advances in hydroacoustic and visual imaging technologies and the use of AUVs broaden the capabilities in identifying and investigating seafloor seep sites expressing various forms of activity. The first visual evidence of active gas emissions on the CAP is reported. Among over 50 MVs, only Venere MV was encountered to show activity during systematic hydroacoustic investigations of the CAP in NovemberDecember 2014. Contrasting to previous assumptions on fluid dynamics associated to mud volcanism, this study reveals that two fluid domains can co-exist: 1) mud breccia outflows, extrusion of thermogenic hydrocarbons, and freshened pore waters at a summit site; and 2) long term advective seepage of methane fuelling cold-seep communities at sites along peripheral ring-faults. Mud breccia extrusion, gas release along peripheral seeps, and caldera Figure 5 . Conceptual model of the upward-branching plumbing system.

Gas diverted laterally from the main conduit (long blue arrows in light grey area) migrates upward (short blue arrows) and may mix with gas of shallow origin (indicated by curved blue arrows). Gas discharge occurs at peripheral seeps (blue circles represent free gas). SCiEntifiC RePoRTS | (2018) 8:6275 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-24689-1 ring-faulting appear to be linked and sustained by persistently high pore fluid pressures. Fluids discharging with mud breccia at the summit are generated by thermogenic organic matter degradation and mineral dehydration reactions occurring at depths of >3 km. This formation depth implies that fluid sources are located below the Messinian to Recent sedimentary infilling of the Crotone forearc basin. Freshened pore waters indicated that Messinian evaporites are either not present or have been removed by fluid migration from below Venere MV. Considering the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbons in both fluid domains, it is inferred that seepage at Venere MV involves an upward-branching plumbing system and that overpressured gas diverted laterally from the main MV conduit migrates upward and mixes with gas of shallow origin. As a result, chemosynthesis-based communities that rely on persistent fluid supply and thick authigenic carbonates are limited to the peripheral seeps along the ring faults of the caldera. An upward-branching plumbing system that experiences high subsurface pore pressures can explain how both mud breccia discharge and quiescent-type seepage co-exist at an individual MV. Such a mechanism may allow for mud breccia discharge to be sustained over timescales exceeding the short-lived eruptions typically associated with active mud volcanism. Furthermore, the upward-branching fluid migration pathways exert an important control on the distribution of seepage-dependent chemosynthesis-based oases of life around submarine MVs. Hydroacoustics. Multi Sediment samples and temperature. Sediment cores up to 5 m long were acquired using a conventional gravity corer and the Dynamic Autoclave Piston Corer (DAPC), the latter allowing for retrieval of cores under in-situ pressure 59 . Seafloor observations, sediment sampling with push cores (30 cm long) and collection of gas bubbles from the water column were conducted using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) MARUM QUEST 4000 m during M112 26 . In-situ sediment temperatures were measured using miniaturized temperature data loggers (MTLs, ANTARES Datensystem GmbH), mounted as an array of 6 sensors on a 5 m gravity core barrel or with a 60 cm long probe (T-stick; 8 sensors), inserted vertically into the sediment using the ROV 60 . Pore water and gas analysis. Pore fluids were extracted from gravity cores and push cores using rhizon samplers. Sulphate and chloride concentrations were determined by ion-chromatography (""882 Compact IC plus 1"" by Metrohm on a ""Metrosep A Supp 5"" column) with an analytical error below 0.4% for both anions. Hydrocarbon data was generated from sediment by headspace technique 61 ; from gas bubble sampling under in-situ pressures over the seeps using the ROV (Fig. 3c) ; and from the DAPC 59 . Methane ex situ concentrations and hydrocarbon compositions were analysed during M112 by gas chromatography 15 . Stable carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios ( 13 C/ 12 C; 2 H/ 1 H) of methane (CH 4 ) were determined by gas chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) at MARUM. Repeated analyses of standards gave a reproducibility for C 1 /C 2+ ratios, stable carbon, and hydrogen isotope ratios of ≤2%, 0.5% and 1%, respectively. Values of ethane (C 2 ) and propane (C 3 ) for GeoB19251-1 were analyzed by GEO-data (Environmental-Laboratory in Garbsen, Germany). Gas hydrate stability calculation. The gas hydrate phase boundary (supplementary Fig. S1 ) was calculated with the program HWHYD 62 . Calculations were performed for gas compositions obtained from mud breccia (extrusion site at western summit; Fig. 2b ) and gas bubbles (peripheral seeps, Sites 1, 2, 4 and 5). Salinities of 10 PSU (freshened pore water values in mud breccia) and 38.5 PSU (bottom water values at peripheral seeps, Sites 1, 2, 4 and 5) were used as input. Conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements were recorded above each site by a Sea Bird Electronics SBE9plus probe 26 . Temperature gradients (supplement Table S1 ) were calculated from temperatures in shallow sediments at the seep sites. Averaged gradients were used at sites where repeated temperature measurements were carried out. The gradients were extrapolated to determine the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ) at the seeps (supplement Fig. S1 ). Data availability. Relevant data will be made available on PANGAEA ® (www.pangaea.de).",M. Loher,2018,29674649,10.1038/s41598-018-24689-1

The cells of type strain ODP1200D-1.5T were motile rods with a single polar flagellum. Growth was observed between 10 and 45-50 degrees C (optimum temperature: 30-35 degrees C, 45-min doubling time), between pH 6.5 and 10.8-11.4 (optimum: pH 8.5-9.0), and between NaCl concentrations of 0 and 21% (w/v) (optimum NaCl concentration: 2.5-3.5%). The isolate was a facultatively anaerobic heterotroph utilizing various complex substrates, hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids. Nitrate or fumarate could serve as an electron acceptor to support growth under anaerobic conditions. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 57.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolate belonged to the genus Marinobacter and was the most closely related to M. aquaeolei strain VT8T and M. hydrocarbonoclasticus strain SP.17T, while DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated that the new isolate could be genetically differentiated from the previously described species of Marinobacter.

210195508,Discharge of deeply rooted fluids from submarine mud volcanism in the Taiwan accretionary prism,"Qualitative and quantitative assessments of fluid cycling are essential to address the role and transport of deeply sourced fluids in subduction systems. In this study, sediment cores distributed across a submarine mud volcano (SMV) offshore southwestern Taiwan were investigated to determine the characteristics of fluids generated through the convergence between the Eurasian and Phillippine Sea Plates. The low dissolved chloride concentration combined with the enrichment of 18O, and depletion of 2H of pore fluids suggest the discharge of deep freshwater formed by smectite dehydration at an equilibrium temperature of 100 to 150 °C. The upward fluid velocities, decreasing from 2.0 to 5.0 cm yr−1 at the center to a negligible value at margin sites, varied with the rate and efficiency of anaerobic methanotrophy, demonstrating the impact of fluid migration on biogeochemical processes and carbon cycling. By extrapolating the velocity pattern, the flux of fluids exported from 13 SMVs into seawater amounted up to 1.3–2.5 × 107 kg yr−1, a quantity accounting for 1.1–28.6% of the smectite-bound water originally stored in the incoming sediments. Our results imply that SMVs could act as a conduit to channel the fluids produced from great depth/temperature into seafloor environments in a subduction system of the western Pacific Ocean.","unconsolidated shale/mudstone, fluid overpressurization, and formation of dense fracture array 9, [12] [13] [14] . Because the fracture network associated with the plate convergence could be extended to as deep as the lower crust, SMVs are able to efficiently export deeply sourced fluids, sediments, and reducing volatiles to the seafloor, generating morphological domes and depressions, mudflows, and even biological hotspots with colonies depending on leaked gaseous hydrocarbons [8] [9] [10] . While SMVs provide a window to witness the deep subsurface characteristics, upward migrating hydrocarbon gases produced by thermal maturation or methanogenesis also drive the sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at shallow depths 9, 10 . Such a biological removal mechanism has been considered to be effective in maintaining a low level of methane in seawater 15 . Overall, the exact characteristics and quantities of deep fluids discharged from SMVs, and their impacts on biogeochemical activities remain poorly constrained in the subduction system of the western Pacific Ocean. In this study, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset of fluids extracted from sediment cores recovered from sites distributed across an SMV, TY1, in the accretionary prism offshore southwestern Taiwan (Fig. 1) . These data were used to assess the fluid source, formation temperature, and fluid-rock ratio for the reaction in the source region. Reactive transport modeling was further applied to quantify the fluxes of fluid and methane exported from various sediment compartments to seawater. Finally, the possible fluid transport pathways in the Taiwan accretionary prism were discussed. Offshore southwestern Taiwan is a westward extending accretionary prism related to the subduction of the Eurasian Plate underneath the Philippine Sea Plate since 18 Ma [16] [17] [18] . The deformation front and its southward extension, the Manila trench, defines the boundary between passive and active margins (Fig. 1a ). The active margin is further divided into two structural domains separated by the out-of-sequence thrust: the Lower Slope and the Upper Slope domains 19 (Fig. 1a ). The Lower Slope domain is featured with the fold-and-thrust ridges; in contrast, the Upper Slope domain is characterized by mud diapiric structures with mud volcanoes 20 . To date, 13 submarine mud volcanoes have been identified 21 . The largest one, Tsangyao Mud Volcano Group (TYMV; re-named after MV12 22 ), is composed of two mud volcanoes (TY1 and TY2; Supplementary Fig. S1 ) fed by one mud diapir, as evidenced by seismic reflection profiles 21, 23 . The TY1 has a conical structure and a wide flat top with a diameter of ~500 m at a water depth of ~370 m 21 (Fig. 1b,c) . Fluid/mud discharges occur at a frequency of every 3 to 10 seconds 24 . Two major gas plumes were detected on the crest by a multibeam echo sounder. These gas plumes could reach to a height of up to 367 m above the seafloor 24 . Other gas venting signals were also observed at the flank of the TY1 ( Supplementary Information, Fig. S2 ). Fluid geochemistry. Variation of solute profiles across TY1. Profiles of solute and gas concentrations are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Most porewater in the upper 120 to 280 cm of sediment had a seawater-like composition. Below this interval at the center sites, concentrations of most ions decreased with depth (potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and sulfate). In contrast, concentrations of total alkalinity (TA), boron, and lithium increased with depth. Between 120 and 280 cm below seafloor (cmbsf), sulfate was undetectable and accompanied by an increase in methane concentration (1-2 mM), forming a sulfate to methane transition zone (SMTZ). Changes in concentration gradient of other solutes were also observed across the SMTZ. For example, calcium and magnesium concentrations decreased to ca. 1 mM and lower than 5 mM below the SMTZ, respectively. The decrease was coincident with the increase in TA concentration (to around 35 mM). At the upper flank (site MV12-A) and lower flank (site F6-3) sites, significant decreases in sulfate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations coincided with the increase in methane and TA concentrations (Figs. 2 and 3). Both lithium and boron concentrations remained at constant values throughout the core at the upper flank site. In contrast, boron and lithium concentrations increased with depth at the lower flank site, where SMTZ was observed at the bottom of the core. At margin sites (sites MV12-C and C-2), concentrations of most ions were close to seawater values. In addition, methane concentrations only increased to at most 50 μM. Both boron and lithium concentrations at site MV12-C decreased with depth ( Fig. 3b ). , sodium (in green), and potassium (in gray) concentration depth profiles at ten sites investigated in this and previous studies (for sites MV12-A) 22 . The solid lines represent the best fit of the modeled results. The lower boundary conditions at site MV12-1 (in dashed line) were assumed to be the same as those at site A2-2. The modeled upward velocity was also provided. (b) Modeled results for sulfate (blue solid line) and methane (red dashed line) depth profiles and AOM rates (R AOM ; gray area) at eight sites.  At the western and southern center sites, δ 13 C-CH 4 values increased from −40‰ on the seafloor to −20‰ above the SMTZ. The δ 13 C-CH 4 value was the smallest at the SMTZ (−50 to −45‰) and remained at a constant value below the sulfate reduction zone ( Fig. 5 ). At the upper flank (site MV12-A) and lower flank (site F6-3) sites, the δ 13 C-CH 4 value was the smallest at the SMTZ (−70‰ at site MV12-A and −48‰ at site F6-3). The δ 13 C-DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) patterns for center and flank sites were similar in a way that the values were the smallest at the SMTZ (−30‰ at site 24; −20‰ at sites MD4-P3 and MD4-P1) and increased towards the seafloor (~0‰) and the bottom of the cores. The C 1 /C 2+ ratios and the δ 13 C-CH 4 values for sites A2-2 and MD4-P3 were between 25 and 90, and between −35.9 and −44.5‰, respectively, falling in the region of thermogenic methane in the plot of C 1 /C 2+ ratio versus δ 13 C-CH 4 value ( Fig. 6 ). For sites 24 and 24-2, the δ 13 C-CH 4 values were between −48 and −37‰, whereas the C 1 /C 2+ ratios increased to more than 120. These data points fell in a region between microbial and thermogenic methane. Reactive transport modeling and fluid flux from SMVs. The reactive transport modeling yielded that upward fluid velocities at western and southern center sites were in the range of 2 to 3 and 2 to 5 cm yr −1 , respectively ( Fig. 2 ). Upward fluid migration is likely absent at the margin site as the solute concentration do not change significantly with depth. The total fluid discharges from the craters and the rest of the cone structures of 13 SMVs were calculated to be 2.9 to 7.3 × 10 6 kg yr −1 and 1.0 to 1.7 × 10 7 kg yr −1 , respectively ( Supplementary Table S6 ). The modeled methane fluxes beneath the depth of SMTZ at the western and southern centers were in the range of 1020-1530 and 972-2990 mmol m −2 yr −1 , respectively ( Table 1 ). The methane fluxes above the SMTZ at these center sites were 162-1380 mmol m −2 yr −1 . The methane flux beneath and above the depth of SMTZ was much lower (347-456 and 9-47 mmol m −2 yr −1 , respectively) at the flank sites (sites MV12-A and F6-3) than at 74 . The black line in (e) indicates the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL; δ 2 H = 8 × δ 18 O + 10). Areas denote with ""LRW"" and ""GW"" in (e) marked the ranges of isotopic compositions for local meteoric water and groundwater from adjacent onshore areas, respectively 75 ; gray square area represents the δ 18 O and δ 2 H values of marine clay [48] [49] [50] [51] . Arrows marked with numbers in (d) and (e) represent processes potentially occurring at the source depth, and their directions denote the trends associated with the processes 8 : 1: volcanic ash alteration at temperatures lower than 300 o C; 2: volcanic ash alteration at temperatures higher than 300 o C; 3: gas hydrate dissociation; 4: biogenic opal recrystallization; 5: clay mineral dehydration; 6: meteoric water input. the center sites. While the methane fluxes above and beneath the SMTZ decreased with the distance from the center, the ratios (flux beneath SMTZ/flux above SMTZ) were relatively higher at the flank sites than at the center sites. Such a variation was translated into an increase in AOM efficiency from 54% at the center sites to 98% at the lower flank sites (Table 1 ). The decreasing chloride concentration with depth ( Fig. 4a ) and carbon isotopic composition and abundance patterns of methane (Figs. 5 and 6) suggest an input of freshwater and thermogenic methane from great depth. Crossplots among δ 18 O values, δ 2 H values, and chloride concentrations ( Fig. 4e ) indicate the deviation of the fluid compositions for the center sites from the GMWL and seawater. The geochemical variation could be best accounted for by the impact of seawater and a deep fluid characterized by low chlorinity, high δ 18 O values, and low δ 2 H values. Such variations in δ 18 O and δ 2 H values cannot be explained by gas hydrate dissociation, ash alteration at high or low temperature, or biogenic opal recrystallization, as these reactions enrich fluids with 2 H or cause no fractionation on hydrogen isotopes 8, 10 . Clay dehydration appears to be the most plausible mechanism to account for the observed geochemical signature. To approximate the temperature of fluid formation, specific cation-ratios were used to derive the fluid temperature [25] [26] [27] . The validity of geothermometers lies in the requirement of the presence of reactant mineral. Since sediments or mineralogy in the source region are not available, the constituent mineral for the formation currently outcropping in southwestern Taiwan was first adopted to evaluate the applicability of the specific geothermometer. The inference is based on the fact that the subduction of the Eurasian Plate underneath the Philippine Sea www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Plate generated a series of westward propagating thrusts that sequentially exhumed the sediments once deposited offshore Taiwan 18 . Therefore, the strata on land could mirror the characteristics and constituents of sediments in the potential source region that is accessible only with the deep drilling. The Plio-Pleistocene Gutingkeng Formation formed in shelf break environments was chosen as the analogy for the source material. The formation is primarily composed of mudstone with lens of siltstone and sandstone 28 . Feldspars at abundances of up to 5% in this formation have been observed 29 . In addition to the constraint from the formation in terrestrial environments, feldspars in cores retrieved from the ODP 1144 site in the abyssal region of the South China Sea amounted up to 1.33 wt.% of the total sediments 30 . Therefore, both observations support the possibility that feldspars are available in the source region and serve the source of sodium and potassium in fluids. The geothermometer based on the Na/Li and Na/K ratio were used for the temperature estimation 25, 27, 31  where the concentration is in molality in Eq. (1) and mg/kg in Eq. (2). The Ca-Mg-K and Mg/Li geothermometers were not considered because the porewater chemistry for all depths at the TY1 is oversaturated with respect to a number of carbonate minerals, such as dolomite and Mg-calcite ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Furthermore, the concentration of magnesium is lower than what is expected by the dilution of seawater by freshwater alone, again suggesting the potential removal of magnesium by carbonate precipitation ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The SiO 2 geothermometers were not applied due to the potential underestimate caused by rapid cooling through the intrusion of the overlying seawater 26 . The fluid temperature was calculated to range between 100 and 150 °C. Our estimated temperature is supported by the high concentrations of lithium and boron (Fig. 3b ), a pattern consistent with the results from laboratory experiments by which lithium and boron are preferentially released from silicate minerals in marine sediments starting at ca. 50 °C [32] [33] [34] . The estimated temperature is also consistent with the predominance of thermogenic methane over microbial methane as being inferred on the basis of isotopic compositions and abundance ratios (Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, the geothermal gradients measured at TY1 vary from 25 °C/km at the margin sites to 390 °C/km at the center sites 23 . Since the crater is directly connected with the conduit channeling hot fluids from great depth, the measured geothermal gradient would be distorted toward a higher value by the advective fluid flow 23, 35 . Instead, the averaged value 35 (25 °C/km) measured at the margin sites and in surface sediments in the region was chosen to represent the regional geothermal gradient. Using this value, the depth producing the observed geochemical signatures was calculated to range between 3.6 and 5.7 kmbsf (kilometer below seafloor). These lines of evidence indicate that a significant fraction of pore fluid is contributed from clay dehydration at high temperatures. Illite and chlorite, which are considerably abundant in sediments offshore southwestern Taiwan 36 , are excluded because illite and chlorite are dehydrated at a much higher temperature range (>237 °C for illite 37 and >650 °C for chlorite 38 ) . Kaolinite is also excluded as a result of being less abundant in the northern South China Sea 39 and stable over the temperature range estimated in this study (decomposed at >800 °C and 19 GPa 40 ). Since the transformation of smectite to illite proceeds at a temperature higher than 60 °C 8,34 and produces fluids enriched in 18 O and depleted in 2 H, smectite is considered to be the most plausible mineral candidate to account for the observed geochemical signature. As abundant smectite and mixed layer (1.1-24.8 wt.% in bulk sediments) have been found in the active margin 41 and passive margin off southwestern Taiwan 39, 42 , and sediments off the Luzon Arc [43] [44] [45] [46] (ODP, sites 1144 and 1146), smectite sourced from Taiwan orogeny and Luzon Arc volcanism and later being subducted/accreted as part of the Taiwan accretionary prism is the most likely source. To further assess the smectite dehydration, we adopted an isotopic mass balance to calculate the ratio of water to rock (W/R) for reactions considering the exchange of oxygen and hydrogen between minerals and pore fluid under a closed-system condition 47 . The fluid-to-mineral ratio for the reaction was calculated based on the mass balance for hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions 47 : values were assumed to range from +19 to +28‰ and from −80 to −36‰, respectively. The temperature dependence for the fractionation factors for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes was calculated according to previous studies for a temperature range between 100 and 150 °C 52, 53 . The calculations yielded the δ 18 O and δ 2 H values varying as a function of equilibrium temperature and W/R ratio (Fig. 7) . Using the measured isotopic compositions of the porewater collected from the center sites (site MD4-P3, Fig. 1b ), the W/R ratios were estimated to be <0.5, 0.3-0.9, and 1.1-1.9 if the δ O r i 18 values were set as +19‰, +20 to +22‰, and +23 to +28‰, respectively. The amount of needed smectite could be further deduced from these W/R ratios considering the possible volume of porewater and assuming the complete reactivity of all available porewater and smectite. To constrain the possible porosity at the depth estimated for smectite dehydration, the porosity variation for cores collected from the Nankai Trough 54 (IODP 358, site C0002, 3.2-km long) was used for the extrapolation. The measurement from IODP 358 yielded a porosity of 17% at the depth of 3.2 kmbsf 54 . By applying the exponential reduction function, the porosity at 5.7 kmbsf was calculated to be 5.6% ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Assuming that the porespace is saturated with porewater and that the porosity is 6%, the quantity of porewater would be lower than 3 wt.% of the bulk sediment. To fulfill the estimated W/R ratios (0.3-1.9) for smectite dehydration, 1.6-10 wt.% of smectite is needed. Such a mineral abundance is consistent with the measured amount of smectite in the current active and passive margin 41, [43] [44] [45] (1.1 to 6.2 wt.% in sediments collected by a sediment trap deployed southwestern Taiwan; 4.5 to 24.8 wt.% in sediments from the ODP 1144 and 1146). As subducted-smectite could be the source of freshwater, fluid fluxes in the SMV region of the accretionary wedge were further assessed. The total amount of smectite-bound fluid within the incoming plate was estimated considering the weight of the incoming plate and the content of smectite and porosity in the sediments [55] [56] [57] : where F a is the flux, C a is the weight percentage of mineral-bound water in smectite, H is the pre-subducted sediment thickness, ρ is the density of dry sediments, ϕ a is the porosity of sediments from the incoming plate, L a is the length of trench, and V a is the subduction rate. The details for calculations were stated in Supplementary Information. The total smectite-bound fluid from the incoming plate was calculated to be 0.7-8.8 × 10 8 kg yr −1 . As sediments are subducted, the buried seawater-like pore fluid and produced smectite-bound fluid would be squeezed and lost gradually with the increasing temperature and pressure. As a result, the actual amount of water released into SMVs region would be substantially lower than that from the incoming plate. Of the overall flux of brackish fluid expelled from SMVs offshore Taiwan (1.3-2.5 × 10 7 kg yr −1 ), approximately 80% of this flux could be attributed to the smectite-bound fluid (1-2 × 10 7 kg yr −1 ) considering the mixing of seawater and freshwater end components (based on the chloride concentration, 110 mM, at the bottom of site MD4-P3). This quantity of smectite-bound fluid released from the SMVs in the region constituted about 1.1-28.6% of the smectite-bound fluid originally subducted into the trench (0.7-8.8 × 10 8 kg yr −1 ). Previous modeling study using the data integrated from geophysical and mineralogical observations for the Nankai Trough 6 demonstrated that the majority of the smectite-bound fluids (4.17 × 10 8 kg yr −1 ; 88% of total smectite-bound fluids in the incoming plate) would be lost to the frontal prism, leaving a total of 0.56 × 10 8 kg yr −1 smectite-bound fluids further released into the overlying wedge as the descending sediments reach the region beneath the Kumano basin where mud volcanoes are abundant. If such a fluid budget for the Nankai system is directly applied to the Taiwan subduction system, a total of 0.8-10.4 × 10 7 kg yr −1 ( = 0.7-8.8 × 10 8 / (4.17 × 10 8 / 88%/ 0.56 × 10 8 )) smectite-bound fluids would be released from the descending sediments into the wedge in the Upper Slope. This estimated flux is comparable with the flux of freshwater expelled into seawater through SMVs offshore Taiwan obtained in this study (1-2 × 10 7 kg yr −1 ). Whether such an analogy of the fluid budget could be drawn directly remains to be explored even though the plate geometry, heat flux, mineral type and content, convergence rate, and the distance between trench to mud volcanoes are comparable between the Nankai and Taiwan subduction systems ( Supplementary Table S3 ). The impact of the deep fluid on shallow subsurface microbial processes is reflected in geochemical profiles. The decreasing rate of upward fluid flow from the center towards the margin sites (Fig. 2 ) varied concomitantly in a similar and an opposite trend with the modeled AOM rates and efficiency, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5 ). For example, at site MD4-P3 where the upward velocity was the greatest, the AOM rate was the highest among eight sites (1610 mmol m −2 yr −1 ), and the AOM efficiency was the lowest (54%) ( Table 1) . In contrast, the upward fluid flow was absent at the lower flank site, whereas the AOM efficiency reached 98% (Table 1) . Such an observation suggests that the upward velocity of the fluid is the primary control of AOM rates. As the capacity of AOM is limited, the efficiency of methane removal could not accommodate the extremely high supply of methane at center sites. This pattern is consistent with those obtained in onshore mud volcanoes in Taiwan 22, 58 and SMVs elsewhere (e.g., the Hakon Mosby SMV 59 ). Porewater and gases for cores distributed along a transect of TY1 were systematically analyzed to assess the spatial variation of fluid velocities and biogeochemical activities and further constrain the fluid budget. The co-variation of the isotopic composition and chloride concentration demonstrates that the majority of fluid retrieved from the crater is derived from smectite dehydration at a temperature of 100 to 150 °C or a depth of 3.6 to 5.7 kmbsf. Assuming that the isotopic equilibrium is reached, the water-rock interaction proceeds at a water-rock ratio of more than 0.3. Reactive transport modeling for compounds inert to microbial processes yielded that the velocity of upward migrating fluid varied from 2 to 5 cm yr −1 at the center sites to a negligible level at the margin sites. By extrapolating such a variation pattern for other SMVs offshore Taiwan, the overall flux discharged from SMVs ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 × 10 7 kg yr −1 . This fluid quantity accounts for 1.1-28.6% of the smectite-bound water originally stored in the incoming sediments, implying that SMVs could act as a conduit to channel the fluid produced from great depth/temperature into seafloor environments. The flux variations across the transect of a mud volcano strongly impact the magnitude and efficiency of the biological filtration of methane through methanotrophy. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Sampling sites. Four expeditions were conducted in the offshore southwestern Taiwan by R/V Ocean Researcher 5 (legs 1309-2 and 0039) and R/V Ocean Researcher I (legs 1107 and 1118). Piston and gravity cores with lengths ranging from 102 to 720 cm were recovered along a transect from the center to the margin of the TY1 cone structure (Fig. 1c ). Sampling sites are listed in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 1b,c. Sampling and analytical methods. Sediments and core top seawater for gas analyses were collected and transferred into serum bottles. These bottles were later filled with saturated NaCl 60 (in cruises OR5-1309-2 and OR5-0039) or 1 N NaOH 58 (in cruises OR1-1107 and OR1-1118) as preservatives, sealed with butyl rubber stoppers, crimped with aluminum caps, and stored upside down at room temperature or 4 °C. Pore fluid samples for aqueous geochemistry were obtained through centrifugation and subsequently filtered through 0.22-µm nylon membrane syringe filters. The filtrates were further split into five fractions for the analyses of anion, cation, total alkalinity (TA), carbon isotopic compositions of DIC, and oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition, and stored at 4 °C. For the cation samples, concentrated nitric acid (70%) was added at a volume ratio of 1:45 to preserve the valence state for elements sensitive to the redox change. The concentrations of headspace hydrocarbon gases were determined by a gas chromatography (GC; SRI 8610 C and Agilent 6890 N) with the precision typically better than 5% 22, 58 . Ion concentrations were determined by an ion chromatography (IC, 882 Compact IC Plus) equipped with a Metrosep A Supp 5 column for anions and a Metrosep C 4 column for cations and with the detection limit around 0.1 ppm in weight 61 . Lithium and boron were analyzed by a sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) for 7 Li and 11 B at low resolution (M:ΔM ~300). Six standards were prepared from reference material NASS-5 (all from National Research Council Canada) with the uncertainty better than 3%. TA was determined by titrating the sample with 0.02 N HCl while bubbling with nitrogen 62 . Carbon isotopic compositions of methane and DIC were measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in line with a gas chromatography and a combustion oven. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of porewater were measured by a LGR Liquid-Water Isotope Analyzer (LWIA; for cruises OR5-1309-2 and OR5-0039) and a Picarro L2140-i Analyzer (for cruises OR1-1107 and OR1-1118). The obtained isotopic compositions were expressed as the δ notation referenced to standards [δ = (R sample /R std − 1) × 1000‰, where R is the ratio of heavy over light isotopes]. Standards are the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) for carbon isotope, and the Vienna Standard Modern Ocean Water (VSMOW) for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. The precisions are ±0.3‰ for δ 13 C values by the IRMS measurements, ±0.2‰ for δ 18 O values and ±2.0‰ for δ 2 Η values by the LWIA measurements, and ±0.03‰ for δ 18 O values and ±0.22‰ for δ 2 Η values by the Picarro spectroscopic measurements. The water content of cored sediments was calculated based on the weight loss of the sediments after freeze-drying. The porosity was converted from the water content assuming a dry sediment density of 2.7 g cm −3 63 . To deduce the velocity of upward fluid in such a dynamic environment 64 , a simplified one-dimensional reactive transport modeling was applied for porewater geochemistry profiles with a revised code 65 . The concentration-depth profiles of five dissolved species, including chloride, sodium, potassium, sulfate, and methane, were calculated. This model is formulated by a partial differential equation for solute transport and reactions 65, 66 . The modeling was first performed on conservative solutes (chloride and sodium) exempted from microbial processes and most abiotic reactions in shallow sediment environments to determine the range of upward advection rates. The sodium and chloride concentrations in the shallow sediments (the top 120 to 280 cm of sediments; Fig. 2 ) did not vary much and cannot be attributed to bioirrigation 67 . Therefore, irrigation induced by bubble transport was incorporated to explain such constant concentrations 60, 68 . Microbial reactions involving sulfate and methane were considered 12, 65 . A detailed description of model-construction, chosen parameters, and boundary condition in the model along with additional sensitivity tests are given in the Supplementary Information. Fluid discharge from SMVs. To estimate the total discharge of brackish water from SMVs, the upward fluid velocities across the TY1 were compiled first with those obtained in the previous study 22 . The upward fluid velocities generally decreased with increasing distance from the edge of crater. Such a trend is also found in other www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ SMVs in offshore Norway and the Gulf of Cadiz 12, 69 (such as the Håkon Mosby and Carlos Ribeiro SMVs). To generalize the fluid velocities across the entire cone structure, the variations in velocity with distance from the edge of the crater were fitted with the exponential equation ( Supplementary Information, Fig. S9a ). The calculation was based on the assumption that the fluid flow was confined through porespace and driven by a single, pressurized fluid source. The velocity distribution was further integrated with the ring area coverage ( Supplementary Information,  Fig. S9b ) to derive the total brackish water discharge using the following equation 12 In this calculation, the crater radius of 250 m, the cone diameter of 3600 m 21 , and the porosity of 36% (an average value of the porosity of TY1; Supplementary Fig. S6 ) were used. The density of water was assumed to be 1000 kg m −3 . The same approach was applied to other 12 SMVs assuming that the upward velocity at the crater of individual SMVs was the same as that at TY1. Since each SMV has different diameters of its crater and cone structure, the relationship between the velocity and the distance ratio was constructed (normalized to the distance from the edge of crater). Such a relationship was then applied to calculate the discharge fluxes of other individual SMVs (Supplementary Information, Table S6 ). Terrestrial mud volcanoes were not considered because their sizes are too small when compared to SMVs 70 . More details are described in Supplementary Information.",Nai-Chen Chen,2020,31942015,10.1038/s41598-019-57250-9
208279838,Discriminative biogeochemical signatures of methanotrophs in different chemosynthetic habitats at an active mud volcano in the Canadian Beaufort Sea,"Several mud volcanoes are active in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. In this study, we investigated vertical variations in methanotrophic communities in sediments of the mud volcano MV420 (420 m water depth) by analyzing geochemical properties, microbial lipids, and nucleic acid signatures. Three push cores were collected with a remotely operated vehicle from visually discriminative habitats that were devoid of megafauna and/microbial mats (DM) to the naked eye, covered with bacterial mats (BM), or colonized by siboglinid tubeworms (ST). All MV420 sites showed the presence of aerobic methane oxidation (MOx)- and anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM)-related lipid biomarkers (4α-methyl sterols and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol, respectively), which were distinctly different in comparison with a reference site at which these compounds were not detected. Lipid biomarker results were in close agreement with 16S rRNA analyses, which revealed the presence of MOx-related bacteria (Methylococcales) and AOM-related archaea (ANME-2 and ANME-3) at the MV420 sites. 4α-methyl sterols derived from Methylococcales predominated in the surface layer at the BM site, which showed a moderate methane flux (0.04 mmol cm−2 y−1), while their occurrence was limited at the DM (0.06 mmol cm−2 y−1) and ST (0.01 mmol cm−2 y−1) sites. On the other hand, 13C-depleted sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol potentially derived from ANME-2 and/or ANME-3 was abundant in down-core sediments at the ST site. Our study indicates that a niche diversification within this mud volcano system has shaped distinct methanotrophic communities due to availability of electron acceptors in association with varying degrees of methane flux and bioirrigation activity.","Geochemical properties. Methane concentration varied at three MV420 sites: DM, BM, and ST (Fig. 2) . The highest methane concentration was observed at the DM site (6.6 ± 4.0 mM), followed by the BM (4.0 ± 3.6 mM) and ST (2.4 ± 1.2 mM) sites (Fig. 2) . Methane concentration was below the detection limit at the reference site (Fig. 2) . The carbon isotopic composition of methane (δ 13 C CH4 ) was −64.8‰ to −45.5‰, and generally showed , and bulk elements (total organic carbon and total sulfur) from sediment cores of (a) devoid of megafauna and/ microbial mats (DM), (b) bacterial mats (BM), (c) siboglinid tubeworms (ST), and (d) reference sites. ""ND"" denotes ""not determined. "" (24.7 mM; Fig. 2 ). δ 13 C DIC values were −11.6 ± 3.2‰ at the DM site, while those of the BM and ST site were more 13 C-depleted (Fig. 2) . In contrast, at the reference site, porewater DIC concentration was relatively constant along the sediment depth at 2.7 ± 0.3 mM, and the δ 13 C DIC values were 13 C-enriched (−4.8 ± 1.6‰). Diffusive methane flux was highest at the DM site (-648.5 mmol m −2 y −1 ), followed by the BM (−427.5 mmol m −2 y −1 ) and ST (−146.6 mmol m −2 y −1 ) sites ( Table 1 ). The corresponding sulfate fluxes were 671.0 mmol m −2 y −1 , 449.1 mmol m −2 y −1 , and 191.4 mmol m −2 y −1 , respectively. Total organic carbon (TOC) content ranged from 0.8 wt.% to 1.9 wt.% at all MV420 sites and from 1.4 wt.% to 1.9 wt.% at the reference site ( Fig. 2) . δ 13 C TOC values (−28.0 ± 0.6‰) were lower in the upper 4 cm depth at the BM site, while other MV420 and reference sites showed relatively 13 C-enriched values (−25.5 ± 0.1‰) ( Fig. 2 ). Total sulfur (TS) content varied between 0.1 wt.% and 1.0 wt.%, with the highest value at the ST site ( Fig. 2 ). δ 34 S TS values were in the range of −18.6‰ to 9.2‰, with the largest sulfur isotopic variation (∆δ 34 S; ~20) at the ST site ( Fig. 2 ). The 4α-methyl sterols that are putatively specific for bacterial groups involved in MOx 31 were abundant at the surface of all MV420 sites but not the reference site. Concentrations were highest at the surface of the BM site, with a range of 0.03-0.37 μg g −1 ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information Table S1 ). Specific fatty acids (FAs) such as C 16 :1ω8 and C 16:1ω5 , which were inferred as markers for aerobic methanotrophic bacteria and SRB, respectively, 23, 32 were detected in a range of 0.01 to 0.14 μg g −1 and 0.01 to 0.09 μg g −1 , respectively ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information Table S1 ). These FAs predominated near the surface of each MV420 site and decreased along the sediment depth. In contrast to bacterial lipids, isoprenoidal dialkyl glycerol diethers (DGDs) (e.g., archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol), which are specific AOM-related biomarkers 33 , were identified in deeper sediment depths (4 to 16 cm) at each MV420 site but not at the reference site ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information  Table S1 ). Isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) containing zero to three cyclopentane moieties (GDGT-0 to GDGT-3) and crenarchaeol were detected in all samples investigated ( Fig. 3 ). Isoprenoid GDGTs were dominated by GDGT-0 and crenarchaeol, at concentrations of 0.05 to 0.72 μg g −1 and 0.03 to 0.77 μg g −1 , respectively, while GDGT-1, GDGT-2, and GDGT-3 were much less abundant (<0.03 μg g −1 ) in all sediments analyzed ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information Table S1 ). The δ 13 C values of 4α-methyl sterols were −104.9‰ to −30. 5‰, and these compounds were strongly 13 C-depleted near the surface layer of each site. The δ 13 C values of FAs ranged from −63.8‰ to −41.2‰ in all sediments investigated. The δ 13 C values of isoprenoid DGDs varied between −109.6‰ and −38.6‰, with higher depletion in sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol (−91.4 ± 16.4‰) than in archaeol (−47.6 ± 6.5‰) ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information Table S1 ). The δ 13 C values of biphytanes (BPs) derived from isoprenoid GDGTs were in the range of −79.5‰ to −19.0‰, showing more 13 C-depleted BP-1 values at all MV420 sites. Dominant methanotrophic taxa. The number of 16S rRNA gene reads of bacteria and archaea ranged from 8711 to 122,357 and from 8070 to 63,065 sequences per sample, respectively (Supplementary Information Table S2 ). We identified 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the order Methylococcales of Gammaproteobacteria, which are aerobic methanotrophic bacteria 23, 34 (Supplementary Information Table S3 and Fig. S1 ). Among them, B_OTU004 dominated near the surface of the DM site (8.0 ± 6.6%), followed by the BM site (3.3 ± 4.2%) and the ST site (1.1 ± 1.2%), while it was not detected at the reference site ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Information Tables S3 and S4 and Fig. S2 ). With the exception of B_OTU004, the proportions of other OTUs of Methylococcales were less than 0.2 ± 0.3% in the samples investigated (Supplementary Information Table S3 ). The relative abundance of A_OTU001, which belongs to ANME-3, was relatively higher (up to 97.1% of archaeal sequences) along sediment depths of MV420 sites, while it was less than 0.08% in the reference site ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Information Table S4 and Fig. S2 ). Another archaeal OTU (A_OTU008) that belongs to ANME-2 comprised 1.4% to 8.7% of archaeal sequences in the deeper sediment depths (4 to 11 cm) of the ST site. But this OTU was rare or not detected in the sediments of the DM and BM sites ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary  Information Table S4 and Fig. S2 ). A_OTU014 and A_OTU015 predominated near the surface of the DM site (up to 13.3% and 6.6% of archaeal sequences, respectively), while the proportion of these OTUs was less than 0.4% at the BM and ST sites ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Information Table S4 and Fig. S2 ). Twelve OTUs of Deltaproteobacteria with a greater than 5% relative abundance of bacterial sequences were separately affiliated with the family Desulfobacteraceae or Desulfobulbaceae ( Supplementary Information Table S4 and Fig. S2 ). Among eight OTUs belonging to the family Desulfobacteraceae, most (B_OTU002, B_OTU009, B_OTU011, B_OTU014, B_OTU024, B_OTU029, and B_OTU076) showed relatively higher abundances at www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ deeper sediment depths at all MV420 sites but not the reference site. B_OTU014 showed the highest abundance (57.5%) at the 16 cm sediment depth of the DM site but did not exceed 2.4% at the BM and ST sites. In contrast, B_OTU018 showed the highest abundance (7.4%) near the sediment surface of the ST site. Among four OTUs belonging to the family Desulfobulbaceae, B_OTU010 showed relatively high abundance (2.8 to 14.4%) in the upper 3 cm of all the MV420 sites but not the reference site. In contrast, B_OTU064 showed high relative abundance only in the upper 4 cm of the ST site (2.1 to 5.5%), and the proportions of B_OTU119 was higher at the 0 to 1 cm depth of the BM site. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Co-occurrence of ANMEs with sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria. To infer the putative sulfate-reducing partners of ANMEs, co-occurrence between two archaeal OTUs (ANMEs) and 12 bacterial OTUs (Deltaproteobacteria) was investigated by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients ( Supplementary  Information Table S5 ). At the DM and BM sites, no OTUs showed significant correlation (p < 0.01) between ANMEs and SRB. At the ST site, both archaeal OTUs showed significantly positive correlation (r = 0.71 to 0.92, p < 0.01) with a few bacterial OTUs (B_OTU002, B_OTU011, B_OTU018, and B_OTU029).  Biogeochemical characteristics along chemosynthetic habitats. Gas bubbles were observed in the ROV video rising within the water column during sampling in the chemosynthetic habitats of MV420. Previous studies using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and an ROV reported that the fresh and warm subsurface muds exposed during eruptions were mostly saturated with methane (δ 13 C CH4 = −64‰ and δD CH4 = −222‰), indicating primarily microbial sources 8, 35 . Consistent with those studies, the overall geochemical signatures observed at the MV420 sites were clearly different in comparison with those of the reference site ( Fig. 2) . Methane and sulfate fluxes calculated based on concentration gradient varied among the three MV420 sites ( Table 1) . The DM site, which was devoid of both sessile and mobile taxa such as polychaeta and bivalves, had the highest methane and sulfate fluxes (648.5 mmol m −2 y −1 and 671.0 mmol m −2 y −1 , respectively). At the DM site, strong methane fluxes may cause an imbalance in hydraulic pressure, especially in shallow layers where sediments are not yet consolidated, resulting in active invasion of bottom seawater 36 . Moreover, the DM sites have been interpreted to be on mud flows which are too young to have yet recruited sessile organisms and in place not even been invaded by mobile taxa 8, 37, 38 . However, in accordance with decreasing fluid flux (<450 mmol m −2 y −1 ), free-living bacteria communities and ST patches had developed differently on the surface of MV420. Thiotrophic bacterial communities were commonly found in seeps with moderate fluid flow rates (~1 m yr −1 ), while STs dominated at seeping systems with a fluid flow rate less than 0.5 m yr −1 15, 22 . Such biological succession has been reported at various seeping sites, which are differentiated by water depths and methane origins -for instance, at the Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) 19 , the Congo deep-sea fan 39 , the Gulf of Mexico 40 , and the deep Eastern Mediterranean Sea 41 . Varying fluid fluxes therefore appear to be a plausible control factor for distinguishing the near seafloor chemosynthetic habitats within MV420. Corresponding with the depleted chloride concentrations along sediment depth profiles, the penetration depth of sulfate supplied from seawater varied among the three MV420 sites, possibly leading to isotopic variations of the total sulfur pool ( Table 1 and Fig. 2 ). The largest isotopic variation (>20) investigated at the ST site may be attributed to the higher contributions of δ 34 S values (ca. + 20‰) from the bottom seawater sources 42 . The sulfate-methane transition zone was formed at the deeper sediment horizons of the ST site compared with other sites. In this regard, δ 13 C CH4 isotopic signatures were more enriched at the ST site, indicating that the remaining methane pool became progressively enriched in 13 C 35,43,44 . These results are in close agreement with 13 C-depleted DIC values, as a result of isotopic fractionation through active AOM under lower methane fluxes [43] [44] [45] [46] . Considering that endosymbiotic bacteria inhabiting STs exploit some substrates (e.g., methane and by-products involved in AOM) in subsurface sediments 47, 48 , bioirrigation activities by STs may enhance the availability of electron acceptors in deeper sediments 17, [49] [50] [51] . These activities allow niche separation between chemosynthetic organisms competing for common energy sources over time 29, 52, 53 . Under varying methane fluxes investigated at MV420, both chemosynthetic organisms (e.g., free-living bacteria and STs) inhabiting seeping sediments appear to have been distinctly separated based on energy source. These results imply that different habitat types mirroring the discriminative intensities of ascending gas-fluids may influence the spatial distribution of methanotrophic communities by altering the availability of electron acceptors. occurrence of aerobic methanotrophs. MOx-and AOM-related microbial communities assessed according to lipid biomarkers and 16S rRNA gene sequences showed a clear down-core shift within each site and variance among the MV420 sites. For the first time in Beaufort MV, we found abundant and 13 C-depleted 4α-methyl sterols in concert with high proportions of OTUs belonging to the order Methylococcales near the sediment surface, strongly indicating a high abundance of aerobic methanotrophs in these sediments ( Figs. 3-5 ), as has been reported from various other seepage sites 19, 28, 53, 54 . The predominance of aerobic methanotrophs at the surface appears to result from the intensities of oxidant-depleted subsurface fluids that limit downward diffusion of sulfate and oxygen from seawater to the uppermost centimeters of the sediment 28, [53] [54] [55] . In such situations, which do not easily allow AOM reactions in deeper sediment layers, a preferential niche of MOx-related methanotrophs is formed in the surface sediment where oxygen is available. Notably, 13 C-enriched 4α-methyl sterols in deeper sediment layers indicate that these compounds originate from processes other than methanotrophy (e.g. organisms using methanol) 56 . However, with the current data set, it is challenging to elucidate exact processes involved, and thus further research is needed. With discriminative distributions of MOx-related methanotrophs among the three MV420 sites, 13 C-depleted 4α-methyl sterols were much more prevalent at the BM site than at other sites (Figs. [3] [4] [5] . Moreover, 13 C-depleted TOC was abundant at the surface of the BM site, indicating that MOx-related biomass was incorporated and preserved in the organic carbon pool for this site [57] [58] [59] . Such distribution patterns investigated at MV420 appear to differ slightly from those of similar MV systems (i.e., HMMV) that showed predominant MOx-related methanotrophs under the highest methane flux 19, 28 . One possible reason for this difference might be that the mud flows migrating to the tops of the DM site were too active and too young for colonization of MOx-related methanotrophs 8 , in contrast to the BM and ST sites. Moreover, previous studies of various seeping sites have suggested that seafloor temperature and oxygen availability are the key factors shaping seep microbial communities 28, 54 . In this study, in situ bottom temperature in the surface did not vary across the MV420 sites (0.37 ± 0.1 °C), indicating that temperature is likely not the key factor explaining the discriminative distribution of MOx-related methanotrophic Methylococcales within a single MV. occurrence of anaerobic methanotrophs. The predominance of sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol over archaeol and OTUs belonging to ANME-2 and ANME-3 clades in sediment depths (4 to 16 cm) indicates the presence of AOM-related methanotrophic communities in these sediments, in contrast to the reference site ( Figs. 3-5 ). The overall 13 C-depleted sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol in all MV420 sites indicated persistent occurrence of AOM in sediments containing sulfate. Based on 16S rRNA results, ANME-3 was more dominant at the BM and ST sites than the DM site. On the other hand, ANME-2 was most frequent at the ST site, indicating a preference for a niche with lower methane flux. Notably, the low abundances of isoprenoid GDGTs (GDGT-1, GDGT-2, and GDGT-3) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicate that the ANME-1 contribution was negligible for AOM in the sediments of MV420 30, 33, [60] [61] [62] . It is worthwhile to note that all surface sediments including that of the reference site showed a dominant crenarchaeol contribution to the total isoprenoid GDGTs pool, indicating a potential contribution of marine Thaumarchaeota 63 . The enriched δ 13 C values of archaeol and BPs suggest that archaeal communities are mixed due to processes other than AOM (e.g., assimilation of AOM-derived inorganic carbon) 64 . These δ 13 C signatures are similar to methane-related archaeal distributions investigated at other MVs (at water depths of 290 m and 740 m) in the Canadian Beaufort Sea 30 . In this regard, niche stratifications among ANMEs appear to be related to differences in environmental preferences within the sampled habitats with varying methane fluxes 53, 54 . At the three investigated MV420 sites, specific archaeal lipids and 16S rRNA signatures clearly reveal the discriminative presence of ANME-2 and ANME-3 involved in AOM between the BM and ST sites (Figs. 3-5) . In contrast to ANME-1, which was observed at a wide range of temperatures (4 to 70 °C) and typically lower www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ methane fluxes [65] [66] [67] , ANME-2 and ANME-3 have been found in samples with temperatures below 20 °C, vigorously emitting MVs such as HMMV 19, 28, 53, 54 and other seepages 52, 66 . Among them, ANME-2 (particularly ANME-2c) was most frequently found in sediments bioturbated by benthic communities such as vesicomyid clams inhabiting low-fluid flux regimes 29, 54, 68, 69 . Considering that vesicomyid clams have so far not been found in the western Arctic, our results indicate a requirement of ANME-2 for lower methane flux. The overall dominance of ANME-3 at the BM site is consistent with previous findings, prevailing across settings in Arctic seeping sites 19, 28, 53, 54 . Meanwhile, at the ST site, ANME-2 can be regarded as the additional methane oxidizer under environmental conditions such as bioturbation and lower methane seepage 60, 70, 71 . Given that the produced sulfide is quickly oxidized by thiotrophic bioturbators, the presence of ANME-2 below tubeworm patches may imply that they seem to form a syntrophic relationship with SRB during AOM 19, 54 . To some degree, ANME-3 appears to tolerate high sulfide concentrations produced during active AOM processes 72 , although the sulfide sensitivity of ANMEs needs to be investigated further. AOM activities performed by both ANMEs seem to support the metabolism of sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts inhabiting frenulata Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis 73, 74 . The presence of diverse methanotrophs at the ST site can therefore be explained by environmental conditions under steady replenishment of sulfate and oxygen levels into the sediments, in accordance with the development of ST patches. With respect to the consortium of ANMEs and SRBs, the presence of sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, including the partner SRB of ANMEs, was assessed by analyzing specific FAs and deltaproteobacterial OTUs (Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae) at the three MV420 sites. The 13 C-depleted, SRB-specific lipid (C16:1ω5) probably derived from Desulfobacteraceae was relatively abundant near the sediment surface, while another specific FA (C17:1ω6) derived most likely from Desulfobulbaceae was not identified in any sediments 60 . Most deltaproteobacterial OTUs showed non-significant correlations with major OTUs of the ANME-2 and ANME-3 clade. Only a few deltaproteobacterial OTUs had a positive correlation with major ANMEs at the ST site. This suggests a weak coupling between ANMEs and Desulfobacteraceae at the MV420 sites, which is inconsistent with reported couplings of SRBs (Desulfosarcina/ Desulfococcus and Desulfobulbus) and ANMEs (ANME-2 and ANME-3) at HMMV 19, 28 . Desulfobacteraceae often occur as single cells in surface sediments of bacterial mat-or clam-covered seeps 75, 76 and decrease with increasing sediment depths 75 . Therefore, this SRB seems to have a metabolic advantage over other SRBs in oxygenated sediments. Accordingly, at MV420, the occurrence of overall ANMEs without partner SRBs may imply that ANMEs were either associated with other SRBs, occurred as loose aggregates or a single cell without direct contact with SRBs 24 , or performed AOM without a partner SRB 77 . More studies are necessary to further investigate ANME-SRB consortia by, for example, applying the technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization. In this study, we provide the first evidence for MOx-and AOM-related methanotrophic communities in connection with chemosynthetic communities at an active MV in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Our results revealed that niche diversification of methanotrophic communities (i.e., Methylococcales and ANME-2 and ANME-3 groups, respectively) may have been shaped by environmental factors such as availability of electron acceptors and bioirrigation activities by chemosynthetic organisms. In comparison with highly local diversification of methanotrophic communities at heterogenous seeping sites 54 , our finding confirms that the supply of electron acceptors is a key factor determining local diversification of methanotrophic communities. In particular, our study is one of the few that show both methanotrophs (i.e., Methylococcales and ANME-3) distributed separately under seeping fluids and high methane fluxes 19, 24, 28, 66 . Our study of methanotrophic signals provides valuable information on the effective removal pathways involved in methane release from marine sediments. Sample collection. Sediment samples were obtained during the 2017 ARA08C cruise of the Korean icebreaker RV Araon at the Beaufort MV (water depth of 420 m) from different chemosynthetic provinces (ARA08C-DIVE105-8 and -9: BO site, ARA08C-DIVE104-7 and-13: BM site, and ARA08C_DIVE105-12 and -14: ST site) using a push core operated by an ROV system and at the reference site (ARA08C-21BC, water depth of 420 m) using a box corer (Fig. 1) . Upon recovery, push-and box-core samples were subsampled horizontally with 20 mL serum vials, which were then sealed immediately with butyl rubber stoppers to prevent gas exchange and stored at 4 °C. Porewater was extracted from holes drilled at intervals of 2 to 3 cm down the core liner using rhizon samplers connected to 20 mL syringes. Extracted porewater was filtered through a 0.20 μm disposable polytetrafluorethylene in-line filter and stored at 4 °C until analysis. After porewater extraction, core sediments were sliced into 1cm sections and subsampled for analysis of bulk elements, lipid biomarkers, and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Subsamples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Gas and porewater analyses. Headspace methane concentration was measured with a gas chromatograph (GC) (7890 A, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) with flame ionization detector. The precision of repeated standard analyses exceeded 5%. Isotopic compositions of methane were obtained using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT 252; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a Combustion III interface (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at Nagoya University. Isotopic values were expressed as δ-notation (per mil) relative to Vienna Pee-Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The δ 13 C values were calibrated using analyses of a methane standard with δ 13 C value of −35.2‰, as certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). Precision for δ 13 C CH4 was greater than ±0.2‰. Chloride (Cl -) and DIC were analyzed by titration using silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) and 0.1 N HCl, respectively. The precision determined by repeated titrations of International Association of Physical Sciences of the Bulk element analysis. Sediment samples were freeze-dried and homogenized using an agate mortar prior to bulk geochemical analyses. For TOC analysis, sediment samples (~1 g) were treated with 8 mL of 1 N HCl to remove carbonates. The TOC content and its isotopic composition were measured using an elemental analyzer (EuroEA3028, Eurovector, Milan, Italy) connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime, GV instruments, Manchester, UK) according to Lee et al. (2018) . Isotopic values are expressed as δ 13 C values in per mil relative to VPDB. The δ 13 C values were calibrated through a CH 3 standard with a δ 13 C value of −24.7‰, certified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA, Austria). The precision for TOC and δ 13 C TOC was better than ±0.2 wt.%, and ±0.1‰, respectively. The total sulfur (TS) content and its isotopic composition were measured using an elemental analyzer (EA1110, Thermo) connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Dual pumped 20-20 S, Secon). Isotopic values are expressed as δ 34 S values in per mil relative to Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite (VCDT). The δ 34 S values were calibrated using S-2 and S-3 standards with δ 34 S values of 22.7‰ and −32.3‰, respectively, certified by the IAEA. The precision for TS and δ 34 S was better than ±0.4 wt.% and ±0.4‰, respectively. Lipid biomarker analysis. Lipid extraction and purification for different compound classes and analyses by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure positive-ion chemical ionization-mass spectrometry were conducted according to previously reported methods 30, 61, 82 . Double-bond positions in fatty acid methyl esters were determined by analysis as their dimethyl disulfide adducts according to the method of Nichols et al. (1986) . All isotopic values were reported using δ-notation (per mil) with respect to VPDB. The precision for δ 13 C values was greater than ±0.5‰, corrected for introduction of additional carbon atoms during sylilation and methylation. Genomic DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted using an Exgene Soil SV mini kit (Cambio, UK) at GeneAll (Seoul, South Korea). The V4-V5 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and V6-V8 regions of archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primer pairs 515F/926R and A956F/A1401R, respectively, at the Integrated Microbiome Resource (IMR) at Dalhousie University, Canada (http://cgeb-imr.ca) 83 . Sequencing of the amplicons was carried out at IMR using the paired-end (2 × 300 bp) Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, USA). 16S rRNA gene sequences processing. Pair end sequences were trimmed based on Sickle 84 quality scores followed by BayesHammer error corrections 85 . The resulting quality-trimmed and error-corrected paired end sequences were assembled using PANDAseq. 86 . Further sequence-processing steps were performed according to the mothur Pipeline package 87 . The assembled bacterial sequences were aligned against a SILVA alignment (http://www.arb-silva.de), and archaeal sequences were aligned against a SINA alignment 88 and subsequently denoised using the ""pre.cluster"" command. Chimeric sequences were removed using the ""chimera.uchime"" command in de novo mode 89 . The sequences were further clustered to OTUs at a 97% sequence similarity level using the opticlust clustering algorithm. Taxonomic assignments of each OTU were determined by sequence similarity searches against the EzBioCloud database 90 . All sequence data used in this study were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive at the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the accession number PRJNA559003.",Dong-Hun Lee,2019,31772218,10.1038/s41598-019-53950-4

34539523,In vitro evaluation of antioxidant and radioprotective properties of a novel extremophile from mud volcano: implications for management of radiation emergencies,"A thermophilic bacterium, designated as RH 127, was isolated from mud volcano (Baratang Islands) of Andaman region, India (12°07'N 92°47'E/12.117°N 92.783°E) for the first time. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicate that it belongs to the genus Geobacillus. The strain showed 98% confirmed 16S rRNA gene sequence homology with Geobacillus toebii. The bacteria was extracted in various solvent systems and three different fractions prepared. In the present study, antioxidant and radioprotective activity of extracts (INM-7860, INM-7861, and INM-7862) of bacterium G. toebii (strain RH 127) were evaluated. The fractions were evaluated for their introspective comparison of the relative antioxidant efficiency. The antioxidative activities, DPPH radical scavenging effects, hydroxyl radical scavenging effects, membrane protection, antihemolytic activity, and linoleic acid degradation efficacies were assayed. INM-7861 and INM-7862 activated NF-κB expression, as evidenced by reporter assay studies, and thereby contributed to overall radioprotective effect. INM-7862 exhibited best results. This study explicitly shows that the extracts of G. toebii have immense potential as a radiation countermeasure agent.",,Atlar Dhaker,2011,21461912,10.1007/s11010-011-0792-7
4841270,Enrichment of sulfate reducing anaerobic methane oxidizing community dominated by ANME-1 from Ginsburg Mud Volcano (Gulf of Cadiz) sediment in a biotrickling filter,"Abstract This study was performed to enrich anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) present in sediment from the Ginsburg Mud Volcano (Gulf of Cadiz) in a polyurethane foam packed biotrickling filter (BTF). The BTF was operated at 20 (±2) °C, ambient pressure with continuous supply of methane for 248 days. Sulfate reduction with simultaneous sulfide production (accumulating ∼7 mM) after 200 days of BTF operation evidenced anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulfate reduction. High-throughput sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes showed that after 248 days of BTF operation, the ANME clades enriched to more than 50% of the archaeal sequences, including ANME-1b (40.3%) and ANME-2 (10.0%). Enrichment of the AOM community was beneficial to Desulfobacteraceae, which increased from 0.2% to 1.8%. Both the inoculum and the BTF enrichment contained large populations of anaerobic sulfur oxidizing bacteria, suggesting extensive sulfur cycling in the BTF.",N/A,Susma Bhattarai,2018,29602106,10.1016/j.biortech.2018.03.018
209474384,A chemical and microbial characterization of selected mud volcanoes in Trinidad reveals pathogens introduced by surface water and rain water,"Abstract Terrestrial mud volcanoes are unique structures driven by tectonic pressure and fluids from the deep subsurface. These structures are mainly found in active tectonic zones, such as the area near the Los Bajos Fault in Trinidad. Here we report a chemical and microbiological characterization of three mud volcanoes, which included analyses of multiple liquid and solid samples from the mud volcanoes. Our study confirms previous suggestions that at least some of the mud volcano fluids are a mixture of deeper salt-rich water and surficial/precipitation water. No apparent water quality differences were found between sampling sites north and south of a major geological fault line. Microbiological analyses revealed diverse communities, both aerobic and anaerobic, including sulfate reducers, methanogens, carbon dioxide fixing and denitrifying bacteria. Several identified species were halophilic and likely derived from the deeper salt-rich subsurface water, while we also cultivated pathogenic species from the Vibrionaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Shewanellaceae, and Clostridiaceae. These microorganisms were likely introduced into the mud volcano fluids both from surface water or shallow ground-water, and perhaps to a more minor degree by rain water. The identified pathogens are a major health concern that needs to be addressed.",N/A,Dirk Schulze-Makuch,2019,31874397,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136087
378075,The Unique Chemistry of Eastern Mediterranean Water Masses Selects for Distinct Microbial Communities by Depth,"The waters of the Eastern Mediterranean are characterized by unique physical and chemical properties within separate water masses occupying different depths. Distinct water masses are present throughout the oceans, which drive thermohaline circulation. These water masses may contain specific microbial assemblages. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of physical and geological phenomena on the microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column. Chemical measurements were combined with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial community in the water column at five sites. We demonstrate that the chemistry and microbial community of the water column were stratified into three distinct water masses. The salinity and nutrient concentrations vary between these water masses. Nutrient concentrations increased with depth, and salinity was highest in the intermediate water mass. Our PLFA analysis indicated different lipid classes were abundant in each water mass, suggesting that distinct groups of microbes inhabit these water masses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed the presence of distinct microbial communities in each water mass. Taxa involved in autotrophic nitrogen cycling were enriched in the intermediate water mass suggesting that microbes in this water mass may be important to the nitrogen cycle of the Eastern Mediterranean. The Eastern Mediterranean also contains numerous active hydrocarbon seeps. We sampled above the North Alex Mud Volcano, in order to test the effect of these geological features on the microbial community in the adjacent water column. The community in the waters overlaying the mud volcano was distinct from other communities collected at similar depths and was enriched in known hydrocarbon degrading taxa. Our results demonstrate that physical phenomena such stratification as well as geological phenomena such as mud volcanoes strongly affect microbial community structure in the Eastern Mediterranean water column.","Microbial diversity and activity are strongly dependent upon the environments in which microbes live [1, 2] . Localized chemistry can strongly impact microbial community structure and function [3, 4] . Environmental factors such as nutrients and temperature are important constraints on the microbes that live in a particular setting [5] [6] [7] . More recently, physical factors such as currents and oceanographic water masses have been shown to be important in dictating localized community structure [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The Mediterranean Sea has a unique chemistry with the waters being characterized by high salinity (38-39 psu relative to 35 psu in the open ocean), elevated bottom water temperatures (12-13°C relative to 4°C at similar depths and latitudes in the Atlantic) and ultraoligotrophic conditions (extreme phosphate limitation) [15] . The waters of the Eastern Mediterranean are stratified with distinct water masses present at different depths [16] . The upper water mass in the Eastern Mediterranean is the Atlantic Water (AW) occupying depths down to around 150 m. Salinity of the AW increases as it flows from the Strait of Gibraltar (*36.5 psu) to the Levantine Basin in the Eastern Mediterranean (*38.6) [16] . Below the AW, at depths between 150-400 m, is the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW). The LIW is characterized by temperatures around 15°C with high salinity (39 psu) . LIW forms in the Levantine Basin of the Eastern Mediterranean and flows at intermediate depths east to west. The Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW) occupies depths below 400 m. The water temperature of the EMDW stabilizes at approximately 13.5°C. The unique chemistry and complex oceanographic regimes of the Eastern Mediterranean may select for distinct microbial communities throughout the water column, which are adapted for growth in nutrient limited environments. The microbial communities of the Northwestern and Northeastern Mediterranean have been studied to investigate how microbes are affected by the ultraoligotrophic conditions of the Mediterranean [17, 18] . For the most part these studies have focused on particular groups of microbes and not entire communities. Two studies focusing on phototrophs, indicated that microbes adapted for growth under low nutrient conditions dominate the phototrophic community in areas under nutrient limitation [17, 18] . Metagenomic analysis of one site in the Eastern Mediterranean showed that an increased number of proteins involved in phosphate transport and processing are an important adaptation to growth under phosphate limiting conditions [19] . It has been hypothesized that the skewed N:P ratio of the Eastern Mediterranean may be due to high rates of nitrogen fixation [20, 21] . However, multiple studies have demonstrated that nitrogen fixation rates are very low in the photic zone of Eastern Mediterranean waters [22, 23] . More recent studies demonstrated that nitrogen fixation is much higher in the aphotic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean, with a larger percentage of nitrogen fixation in the Eastern Mediterranean occurring in the deep water [24] . Additional studies have investigated the changes that occur in the microbial community throughout the water column. In general bacterial numbers decrease from mid 10 5 cells/ml in the surface waters to mid 10 4 cells/ml in the bottom waters [25] . Yokokawa et al. (2010) demonstrated that there are differences in bacterial abundance and microbial community structure at different depths [25] . However, there were also localized distinctions between samples collected within the same water masses from different sampling stations. It was suggested that these site-specific differences could be attributed to local chemical differences, such as organic matter load [25] . Most of the investigations into microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column have focused on the Northeastern Mediterranean or off the coast of Israel. There is almost no information regarding the microbial community of the water column in the Southeastern Mediterranean, especially locations adjacent to the Nile River Delta. Despite limited knowledge of the microbial community in the water column adjacent to the Nile River, several studies have investigated the microbial communities in the numerous natural hydrocarbon seeps in the Nile Deep Sea fan [26] [27] [28] [29] . The Nile Deep sea fan is a sedimentary turbiditic system extending from the Nile delta into the Eastern Mediterranean [30] . Recent work has indicated that mud volcanoes are found throughout the Nile Deep-Sea Fan, the Olympia field on the Mediterranean ridge, and the Anaximander Mountains in the Northeastern Mediterranean [31, 32] . These natural seeps are hot spots of deep-sea life, and impact the diversity of microbes present in the seep-associated sediments [33] . Active mud volcanoes can emit large volumes of methane and other hydrocarbons and in turn have the potential to impact the microbial community of the water column overlaying these seeps. Several studies have investigated the microbial community in mud volcano sediments throughout the Eastern Mediterranean [26, 27, 29] . These sediment communities are known to be diverse and contain a variety of microbes involved in sulfur oxidation, methanotrophy, methylotrophy, degradation of higher hydrocarbons, and anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) [27] [28] [29] . In this study, we collected samples from the water column above the North Alex Mud Volcano in order to determine the effect of geological phenomena such as hydrocarbon seeps on structuring the microbial community of the water column. The Eastern Mediterranean is known for the stratification of the water column and the presence of a number of active mud volcanoes. Our study aims to characterize the effect of water stratification and mud volcanism on the microbial community in the water column of the Southeastern Mediterranean. We combine chemical measurement with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and massively-parallel 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize microbial abundance and diversity at five stations. PLFA analysis provides a robust measure of microbial biomass as well as insights into the physiological state of the active microbial community in a sample [34] . Lipid biomarkers can also be used as indicators for the presence of particular microbial groups [35] . 16S rRNA sequencing provides an in-depth look into which microbial taxa are present with much finer taxonomic precision than can be achieved with PLFA analysis alone. These complementary techniques were used in order to reduce the biases that any single technique would have and provide multiple lines of evidence for any conclusion [36] .  Samples were collected between 11 and 15 October 2012 at five stations in the West Nile Delta region of the Nile Deep Sea Fan aboard the MV Fugro Navigator. This work was conducted in BP's West Nile Delta Concession. No specific permits were required for collection of these samples. These field studies did not include the collection of any endangered or protected species. Temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation, pH, and turbidity were measured at each station using a Valeport Midas+ CTD (Fig. 1B and S1 Fig.) . Samples were taken from four depths based on the CTD profiles. Temperature and salinity profiles were constructed using the oce package in R [37] . One sample from each station was taken within or directly above the thermocline. One sample was taken within the region of increased salinity that occurred between 150 and 400 m. Another sample was taken at two-thirds of bottom depth. The fourth sample was collected 20 m above the sea floor. In total, 20 samples were collected (S1 Table) . These stations represented diverse sea floor features, including the North Alex Mud Volcano and the Alexandria Canyon (Station 3 and 4 respectively, Fig. 1A) . Water was collected from each depth using Niskin bottles. 100 ml of water were frozen at −20°C for analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nutrients. Forty ml of water were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C for acridine orange direct counts Maps of sampling sites were prepared using the ODV software package [38] . (B) CTD profile of Temperature and salinity for site 1 (depth 1230 m). Temperature measured in°C is shown in red. Salinity measured in Practical Salinity Units (psu) is shown in green. (C) Annotated T-S plot with data from the CTD profile of site 1. Three distinct water masses are visible below the surface mixed layer. The AW is characterized by water with salinities between 38.6 and 38.8 psu and temperatures between 16-18°C. The LIW is characterized by high salinity around 39.2 psu and temperatures around 16°C. The EMDW is characterized by waters with salinities near 38.8 and temperatures near 14°C. Visualization of CTD data was performed in R [39] using the oce package [37] . (AODC). Samples for microbial community analysis were collected using the large volume Stand Alone Particle Sampler (SAPS, Challenger Oceanic, UK with controller, battery and pump upgrades by Oceanlab, University of Aberdeen, Scotland). Between 62 and 123 L of seawater were filtered at depth through a 292 mm diameter nylon filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm (volume filtered for each sample is listed in S1 Table) . The filter was sectioned into thirds, onethird for DNA analysis, one-third for PLFA analysis, and one-third as an archive. DOC, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and inorganic nutrients were measured at the SOEST Laboratory for Analytical Biogeochemistry (University of Hawaii). DOC and TDN were measured using a Shimadzu High-Temperature TOC-L Combustion Analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan). DOC is reported as non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). Quality control testing for NPOC and TDN was conducted using purchased Deep Seawater Reference Material (DSRM) from the RSMAS Consensus Reference Materials (CRM) Project (http://yyy.rsmas.miami.edu/groups-/ biogeochem/CRM.html). Ammonia was measured fluorometrically following the method of Kerouel and Aminot (1997) [40] . Nitrate and nitrite were analyzed via the diazo reaction based on the methods of Armstrong et al (1967) [41] and Grasshoff (1983) [42] . Silicate measurement is based on the reduction of silicomolybdate in acidic solution to molybdenum blue by ascorbic acid [42] . Orthophosphate concentrations were determined based on the colorimetric method of Murphy and Riley (1962) [43] . In order to identify patterns and similarities in the physical and chemical parameters of samples from the same water mass, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of environmental data was performed in R using the prcomp command [39] . The data was centered so that the variables are shifted to be zero centered and scaled by dividing each number by the standard deviation. PERMANOVA analysis [44] was performed on a Euclidian distance of the normalized environmental data using the Adonis function in Vegan [45] . Acridine Orange Direct Cell Counts AODC were performed as described previously [46] . Water samples for direct cell counts were preserved with 4% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C until processed. Cell counts were done with Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Germany). One-third of the SAPS pump filter was stored at −80°C for PLFA analysis. The filter was transferred to a muffled glass centrifuge tube using a solvent-rinsed forceps. The total lipids were extracted using a two-phase extraction method with final ratio of methanol:chloroform:water buffer being 1:1:0.9 (v/v/v) and subsequently fractionated on a silicic acid column with only the polar lipids then transesterified into phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methyl esters [47] . The PLFA methyl esters were separated, quantified, and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) [47] . Archaeal lipids were not analyzed. Cell counts were estimated from PLFA data using the conversion factor of 5.9 x 10 4 cells per pmole of PLFA [34] . PLFA cell counts were compared with AODC counts to determine how microbial abundance changes with depth. AODC cell counts are able to detect all types of microbial cells including Eukaryotes, Archaea and Bacteria. Alternatively, PLFA analysis will only detect Eukaryotes and Bacteria. PLFA has the advantage of providing information on viable cells only [34, 48] , whereas AODC will measure both viable and dead cells. The combination of these two methods provides a robust estimate of total and active prokaryotes in an environment. In addition to biomass estimates, PLFAs were grouped into lipid classes. The mole percent of each lipid class was determined for samples from each water mass. To test the hypothesis that lipid classes were differentially abundant in each water mass, one-way ANOVA was performed comparing the mole percent of each lipid class in samples grouped according to water mass. P values were corrected using the false discovery rate calculation in R. Tukey honest significant difference test was used to determine which water masses were significantly different from each other. The full list of lipids in each sample is presented in S2 Table. DNA Extraction, Sequencing, Analysis One-third of the SAPS filter was stored at −80°C for DNA analysis. DNA was extracted using a modified Miller DNA extraction method [49] . Quality of extracted DNA was determined by measuring 260/280 and 260/230 ratios on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Concentration of DNA was determined using picogreen (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with universal primers 515f and barcoded 806r, which are able to amplify both Bacterial and Archaeal sequences. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq according to the protocol in Caporaso et al (2012) [50] . The resulting DNA sequences were analyzed using the QIIME version 1.8.0-dev pipeline [51] . Paired-end raw reads were assembled using fastq-join [52] . The assembled sequences were demultiplexed and quality filtered in QIIME to remove reads with phred scores below 20 (-q 19). Chimera detection was then performed on assembled reads using UCHIME [53, 54] . Assembled, qualityfiltered and chimera checked sequences were deposited at MG-RAST (http://metagenomics. anl.gov/) (accession number 4571952.3-4571971.3). Sequences were then clustered into operation taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity) with UCLUST [53] using the open reference clustering protocol. The resulting representative sequences were aligned using PyNAST [55] and given a taxonomic assignment using RDP [56] retrained with the May 2013 Greengenes release. The resulting OTU table was filtered to keep OTUs that were present at greater than 0.005%, and then rarified to 13,753 sequences per sample (the minimum number of remaining sequences in the samples). The alpha diversity of samples was determined using the Shannon, Simpson, and phylogenetic diversity (whole tree diversity) metrics. To test the hypothesis that alpha diversity was significantly different between these three water masses ANOVA and Tukey honest significant difference test were performed. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity [57] , weighted and unweighted unifrac distances [58] were calculated from the rarefied OTU table using the beta_diversity.py script in QIIME. In order to test the hypothesis that microbial communities from the same water mass were significantly similar to each other and statistically different from other water masses; hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were used. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the hclust command in the ecodist [59] package in R with a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the average linkage method. To further test this hypothesis weighted Unifrac distances were used to construct two-dimensional NMDS plots. The lowest stress configuration was chosen from 50 iterations of plot construction. Stress values were calculated using the default stress calculation in the nmds command in the ecodist package. To test if samples from the same water mass were significantly different from each other PERMA-NOVA analysis was performed on both the Bray Curtis and weighted Unifrac matrices using the Adonis function in the vegan package in R. Samples were grouped according to the water mass from which the samples were taken using the depth cutoffs as follows: AW: 10-150 m, LIW: 150-300 m, EMDW: 300-1210 m. There were five samples in the AW group, five samples in the LIW group and ten samples in the EMDW group. PERMANOVA analysis was performed using 999 permutations. PERMANOVA analysis of all three groups will indicate if there is a significant difference between all three groups. To distinguish which water masses are different from each other, PERMANOVA analysis was done on subsets of the weighted Unifrac distance matrix that only include samples from two of the three water masses. These pair-wise PERMANOVAs were used to distinguish which water masses were different from each other. To test if bacteria and archaeal populations were both stratified by water mass, the OTU table was split to separate OTUs identified as bacteria into one OTU table and OTUs identified as Archaea into another. Weighted Unifrac distances were determined for each of these domain-specific OTU tables. NMDS analysis was performed using weighted Unifrac distances as described above. To determine if the Bacterial and Archaeal communities in the three water masses were different from each other, PERMANOVA analysis was performed using the Adonis function in the vegan package in R. Environmental variables were fit to the weighted Unifrac distance matrix in order to test which environmental variables explain the differences observed in the beta diversity analysis. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, depth, salinity, sulfate, silicate, nitrate, inorganic phosphate, NPOC, and total nitrogen were fit to the weighted Unifrac distance matrix using the envfit function in the vegan package in R. The significance of the variable fitting was determined using 999 permutations. Variables that fit the data with a p value of less than 0.05 were plotted. In order to test the hypothesis that microbial classes are differentially abundant between these water masses, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the relative abundance each taxonomic order in samples from different water masses. P values were corrected using False Discovery Rate correction. Tukey honest significant difference test was used as a post hoc test to identify in which water masses the taxa were differentially abundant. Taxonomic orders that had an ANOVA corrected p value of less than 0.05 were considered to be significantly different. To further identify microbial taxa that were indicative a particular water mass, Indicator species analysis was performed in R using the IndVal function in the labdsv package [60] . Indicator species analysis seeks to identify taxa that are present in the majority samples of one group and absent in the majority of samples from other groups. Indicator species analysis calculates an IndVal as described in Dufrene and Legendre [61] . IndVal is the product of the relative frequency and relative average abundance of a species or OTU in a cluster. The maximum IndVal of 100% is observed when an OTU is present in all sites of only one sample group. To test the significance of the IndVal, p values were calculated with 100 iterations, where in each iteration, the sample groupings were randomly assigned and an IndVal determined. These randomized IndVals were compared to the IndVal arrived at using the defined groupings to determine the likelihood of that IndVal being arrived at randomly. The p values for the IndVal calculation were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate correction.  The temperature profiles of the water column indicated a thermocline at approximately 50 m depth (Fig. 1B) . Below 400 m the water temperature became constant at 13.8°C. The salinity at these stations was between 38-39 psu. The dissolved oxygen remained high throughout the water column and decreased to about 70% of saturation at depth (Table 1) . Turbidity and pH were relatively constant throughout the water column with pH at 8.2 and turbidity around 1.5 FTU. Temperature and salinity plots of the water profiles indicated the presence of three water masses at these sampling sites (Fig. 1 C) . Water profiles of our sampling stations indicate that the salinity of the LIW is much higher than the AW and EMDW. Our data also show that the AW is characterized by low or below detection levels of inorganic nutrients, and high NPOC levels (mean 97.4 μM) ( Table 1 and S1  Table) . Inorganic nutrients concentrations increased in our samples throughout the LIW, whereas NPOC decreased with increasing depth (S2 Fig). Nutrient concentrations, NPOC, and salinity all remained fairly constant throughout the EMDW at these five sampling locations. PCA of environmental factors for the 20 water samples demonstrated that water samples from the same water mass cluster together on the PCA plot (Fig. 2) . These distinct groupings corresponded to the three water masses. PERMANOVA of Euclidian distances demonstrated that samples from the same water mass were significantly different from samples from the other water masses (P permutated = 0.001). Both AODC and PLFA biomass estimates indicate that the biomass was highest in the AW and gradually decreased with depth (Fig. 1D ). Cell counts estimated by PLFA analysis were almost an order of magnitude lower than the cell numbers determined by AODC. Despite these discrepancies, both methods demonstrate that the microbial abundance in the AW was higher than in the intermediate and deep-water masses. The mole percent of polyunsaturated lipids in our samples was significantly different between these three water masses (ANOVA P = 0.0004). Polyunsaturated lipids comprised 11.9 mole percent of the lipids in the AW, whereas they made up 2.7% and 1.9 mol% in the LIW and EMDW respectively (Table 2) . Mid-Branched saturates were also differentially abundant between these water masses (ANOVA P = 0.02). The abundance of mid branched saturates was highest in the LIW and is significantly different from the abundance in the AW (Tukey HSD P = 0.005). Microbial diversity is distinct for each water mass 1.7 million 16S rRNA reads were retained after quality filtering. The average number of reads per samples was 83,948 with the number of reads ranging from 13,753 to 160,639 (S3 Table) . The total number of OTUs present at a relative abundance of greater than 0.005% was 1,023. Diversity analysis using Shannon, Simpson, and Phylogenetic Diversity-whole tree metrics indicate that microbial diversity was lowest in the samples from the AW. The highest diversity was seen in samples from the LIW. Diversity then decreased in the EMDW (Fig. 3A and S3  Fig) . Alpha diversity was significantly different between water masses for each of the metrics tested as determined by ANOVA and Tukey HSD test (Table 3) . Both hierarchical clustering and NMDS analysis indicated that samples from the same water mass clustered together (Fig. 3 B and C ). There were significant differences in the microbial communities of each water masses as determined by PERMANOVA analysis (Bray Curtis-P permuted = 0.001, weighted Unifrac-P permuted = 0.001). Samples from AW clustered very closely together and were distant from samples derived from the deeper two water masses ( Fig. 3B and 3C ). PERMANOVA analysis indicates that the AW was significantly different from the LIW and EMDW (AW v. LIW-P permutated = 0.006, AW v. EMDW-P permutated = 0.001). PERMANOVA analysis comparing the LIW and EMDW showed that even though the differences between the LIW and EMDW were less pronounced, they were significant (P permutated = 0.012). NMDS plots constructed using OTU tables separated by domain revealed that both the Bacterial and Archaeal communities clustered by water mass. PERMANOVA analysis of the separated microbial communities indicate that there were significant distinctions in the bacterial and archaeal communities between the three water masses (Archaea-P permutated = 0.002; Bacteria-P permutated = 0.001) (S4 Fig.) . Environmental variables were fit to the NMDS plot to examine which physical and geochemical factors affect community structure (Fig. 3C) . Temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, silicate, nitrate, inorganic phosphate, NPOC, and total nitrogen all significantly fit the NMDS plot with p-values less than 0.05. The microbial community in the AW was strongly affected by NPOC and somewhat by temperature. Salinity partially dictates the distinction between the EMDW and LIW. Nutrient concentrations were the main factor structuring the community of the EMDW. Distinct microbial taxa were found in each water mass (Fig. 4) . ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests comparing the relative abundance of microbial classes across water masses revealed that 53 classes show significant differential abundance across the three water masses. Additionally, 37 indicator taxa were identified by indicator species analysis as good indicators of the water masses. The most abundant groups in the AW were Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The Cyanobacterial groups in the AW were comprised of both relatives of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Synechococcus were most abundant at the very top of the AW (10 m depth) and Procholorococcus dominated the remaining AW samples (50 to 60 m depth). The Proteobacteria in the AW were predominantly Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria. Furthermore, the dominant Bacteroidetes in the AW were primarily from the Flavobacteria class. The mean relative abundance of Flavobacteria in the AW is 11% of recovered reads, which was ten times greater than the average abundance of Flavobacteria in the LIW and EMDW. The abundance of Alphaproteobacteria was significantly different between the three water masses (ANOVA p-value 0.0001) with the highest relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in the AW. Indicator species analysis confirmed this, showing that Alphaproteobacteria, as well as Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes were all good indicators of the AW (Fig. 5) Fig 3.

Despite the differences in overall microbial community structure between the intermediate and deep-water masses (P permutated = 0.012), the most dominant taxa in the both water masses were Thaumarchaeota. Euryarchaeota were also a large portion of the recovered reads from the two deeper water masses (8-14% of recovered reads). These Euryarchaeota are from the Marine Group II and Marine Group III families. ANOVA with Tukey HSD test and Indicator Species analysis indicated that Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Thaumarchaeota, and Archaea from the class Halobacteria were enriched in and good indicators of the LIW. The relative abundance of Deltaproteobacteria was significantly different between the three water masses (ANOVA corrected p-value 2.01E-08) and was higher in the LIW relative to the other two water masses. While, halophilic Archaea were a relatively low percentage of recovered reads in all samples, they are good indicators of the LIW (indicator value: 0.99, q-value: 0.019). Gammaproteobacteria related to Methylococcales and Oceanospirillales, as well as SAR406 and Nitrospirae are indicators of the EMDW, based on indicator species analysis. Gammaproteobacterial abundance was significantly different between the three water masses (ANOVA P = 1.43E-07). Gammaproteobacteria were present at higher abundance in the EMDW relative  The near-bottom sample from the North Alex Mud Volcano (Station 3) was quite distinct from other samples at similar depths. In particular the relative abundance of Flavobacteria, Methylococcales, and Thiotrichales was higher in this sample relative to other samples from similar depths. (Fig. 4 and S6 Fig.) . Flavobacteria were present at high relative abundances in the AW, but much lower abundances in the LIW and EMDW. In this mud volcano sample, Flavobacteria comprised 12% of recovered reads, which is almost ten times greater than any other deep-water sample. Thiotrichales were found at 4% of recovered reads in this samples compared to an average of 0.98% in the rest of the EMDW. Additionally relatives of Methylococcales were present at high abundance in this sample (22.7% of recovered reads). Methylococcales were only found at similar abundances in samples taken from much deeper depths.  The goal of this study was to identify the effect of physical and geological phenomena on structuring the microbial community in the Eastern Mediterranean water column. Our geochemical analysis demonstrated that the waters of these sites in the Eastern Mediterranean are highly stratified by depth. Chemical and physical stratification at our sampling stations separated according to the three previously described water masses [16] . Our results indicated that higher organic carbon and higher temperatures are characteristics of the AW, the LIW has elevated salinity, and the EMDW has higher nutrient concentrations. Our results also confirm previous reports, which state that phosphate concentrations are low throughout the water column [15, 62] . The distinct physical and chemical properties of these water masses afford distinct niches in which different microbial communities can establish themselves. Our results also demonstrated that microbial abundance differed by depth. The high cell numbers in the surface waters are in line with previous reports, which demonstrated a decrease in cell numbers with depth [25] . AODC cell counts were an order of magnitude higher than cell counts determined by PLFA analysis. This could be due to the fact that PLFA cell counts are derived from a conversion factor, which is often determined from cultured cells and is also based on bacterial cell size. Therefore, PLFA conversion factors do not always directly relate to cell counts [48] . Additionally, PLFA measurements do not take into account Archaeal lipids. Thaumarchaeota are often dominant microbes in deep marine waters [63] [64] [65] [66] . Therefore, PLFA biomass estimates from water with high numbers of Archaea, may underestimate microbial cell numbers. Analysis of PLFA biomarkers confirmed the presence of distinct microbial taxa in each water mass. We have demonstrated that the surface waters have a higher relative mole percent of polyunsaturated lipids. Polyunsaturated lipids are indicative of Cyanobacteria (18:2ω6) and Eukaryotes (polyunsaturates with an ω3 double bond) [67] . Our PLFA data suggests that active phototrophic microbes were present at much higher abundance in the surface waters compared to the deeper water masses. Our PLFA results also indicate an increase in mid-branched saturated PLFA in the LIW and EMDW. Mid-branched saturates are biomarkers for metal and sulfate reducing microbes [67] , many of which are from the Deltaproteobacterial class. The elevated levels of these PLFAs may indicate higher abundance of these microbial taxa in these deep-water masses. More detailed distinctions in the microbial community structure were observed when analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing data. We demonstrated that microbial diversity (Shannon, Simpson, and phylogenetic diversity) was significantly different between these water masses, with the diversity being highest in the LIW. The lowest diversity was observed in the AW with an increase in diversity in the LIW and a subsequent decrease in the EMDW. Nutrient concentrations gradually increased across the LIW. This gradient may provide a variety of niches capable of supporting diverse communities of microbes in the same water mass. Our results are in line with previous reports that have shown that the diversity of deep-water microbial communities is higher than surface and subsurface waters [11, 14] . Our findings also confirm previous studies, which have shown that microbial communities are distinct in different oceanic water masses [11, 12, 14] . It is not surprising that the microbial community in the photic zone was distinct from that in the aphotic zone, however there were significant and unexpected differences in the microbial community between the LIW and the EMDW. A recent study of the microbial community in the Southwest Atlantic indicated that there were very few differences between deep-water masses in the Southwest Atlantic [14] . However, we observed distinct differences between each of the three water masses in our samples from the Eastern Mediterranean. Cyanobacteria were most abundant in the AW, which has the highest light levels to support growth of phototrophic microbes. The majority of Cyanobacterial reads recovered from samples from the AW were related to Prochlorococcus species, which are well adapted for growth in nutrient poor surface waters. The stoichiometry required to support growth of Prochlorococcus is shifted from the Redfield ratio enabling growth in phosphorus-limited ecosystems such as the Eastern Mediterranean [68, 69] . In addition to Prochlorococcus, Alphaproteobacteria are significantly enriched in the AW. These Alphaproteobacteria are related to Rhodosprillales, Rhodobacteriales, and Rickettsiales, which are related to SAR-11-a ubiquitous bacterium in marine surface waters [70] . Both Prochlorococcus species and members of the Alphaproteobacteria are well adapted for growth in oligotrophic environments [71] . The nutrient concentrations in the AW are much lower than in other water masses and in many cases below detection. These low nutrient concentrations may select for these microbes, which are capable of thriving under nutrient limitation. Members of the Flavobacteria were also found at significantly higher levels in the AW relative to the deeper two water masses. Members of the Flavobacteria have been shown to be involved in degradation of high molecular weight organic matter [72] and could be involved in degrading the organic matter that is produced by phototrophic Cyanobacteria and algae in the AW. Thaumarchaeota related to cosmopolitan ammonia oxidizing Archaea [63] [64] [65] [66] were dominant members of the deep-water community representing between 18-40% of the recovered reads for samples from the LIW and EMDW. The fact that Thaumarchaeota dominated samples from the LIW and EMDW indicates that they perform an essential function in the intermediate and deep-water environments of the Eastern Mediterranean and may be important players in the nitrogen cycle of the Mediterranean deep-water. Elevated levels of Deltaproteobacteria were also a defining factor of the LIW. Many of these Deltaproteobacteria are closely related to SAR324, which are physiologically diverse group [73] . Some microbes in the SAR324 group have the ability to grow autotrophically and heterotrophically participating in carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycling [73, 74] . Their presence at elevated levels in the LIW may indicate that some of these processes are occurring in this intermediate water mass. Some of the important taxa in the LIW are putatively involved in nitrogen cycling. For example, Nitrospinaceae, Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi from the SAR202 class are all important member of the microbial community in the LIW. Nitrospinaceae related to the autotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacterium, Nitrospina, are good indicators of the LIW (indicator value 0.82 qvalue 0.019). Members of the Planctomycetes are quite diverse in their ecology and functional capacity, with some Planctomycetes able to perform anaerobic ammonia oxidation (annamox), which is an essential process in the nitrogen cycle of many marine environments [75] , [76] . Chloroflexi from the SAR202 class were also found at high abundances in the LIW (10-15% of recovered reads). It has been proposed that Members of the SAR202 class are involved in amino acid mineralization [77] . These findings indicate that some of the microbes in the LIW are putatively involved in autotrophic and heterotrophic processes related to nitrogen cycling. The importance of nitrogen cycling in the Mediterranean deep-water was suggested by a recent study which showed that nitrogen fixation in the aphotic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean was quite high [24] . Our finding that the predominant taxa in the LIW were related to microbes involved in nitrogen cycling processes suggests that the LIW is an essential part of the nitrogen cycle of the Mediterranean Sea. We also found organisms that were indicative of the different water masses. Our results demonstrate that the LIW has the highest salinity of the three water masses in the Eastern Mediterranean. Correspondingly, we found halophilic Archaea from the class Halobacteria were good indicators of the LIW (indicator value 0.99, q value 0.019). This high indicator value suggests that Halobacteria were found in most of the samples from LIW and were absent in lower salinity samples from the AW and EMDW. The ability of Halobacteria to thrive under high salt conditions [78] may allow them to colonize the higher salinity LIW. Parvarchaeota were indicators of the EMDW. The Parvarchaeota are a poorly understood group in a newly described super phyla unified by their small cell size and small genome size [79, 80] . Their role in the EMDW microbial community is still unclear, and requires further investigation. Gammaproteobacteria from the Oceanospirillales and Methylococcales orders were present at high abundance in the EMDW microbial community. The most abundant Oceanospirillales in the EMDW were most closely related to the SUP05 and Halomonadaceae families. Relatives of SUP05 have been found as a part of sulfur oxidizing assemblages in different environments [81, 82] . There is metagenomic and physiological evidence that the SUP05 group is involved in autotrophic growth involving sulfur and hydrogen oxidation. Microbes related to SUP05 were indicators of the EMDW (indicator value of 0.99, q-value of 0.019) suggesting that sulfur and hydrogen oxidation may be occurring in the EMDW. Additionally, Sequences corresponding to Methylococcales comprised between 5-20% of the recovered reads in samples from the EMDW and were indicator species for the EMDW (Indicator value 0.99, q-value 0.019). Methylococcales are methanotrophs and typically acquire their carbon and energy from methane oxidation. The dominance of sequences related to known methanotrophs suggests that methane oxidation may be another important physiology in the deep waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. Many of the microbes in the deeper water masses are putatively involved in autotrophic physiologies. Therefore, it is possible that the oligotrophy of the Eastern Mediterranean has selected for a set of autotrophic microbes that use the available nutrients in energy generating processes. Another goal of this study was to characterize the effect of geological phenomena such as mud volcanism on the microbial community of the water column. Our results demonstrate that the microbial community directly above the North Alex Mud Volcano was distinct from the microbial community in other samples from similar depths. However, the microbial community in the upper water column (i.e. AW and LIW) above the North Alex Mud Volcano resembled the microbial community from samples collected within the same water masses in other sampling locations. Members of the Flavobacteriales, Thiotrichales and Methylococcales were present at higher abundances in this mud volcano sample as compared to samples from similar depths from other stations. Flavobacteria have been implicated in degradation of high molecular weight organic matter [72] . It may be that the mud volcano has enriched for microbes capable of utilizing the emitted organic material from the mud volcano. The Thiotrichales sequences in this sample are most similar to members of family Piscirickettsiaceae. PAH-degrading Cycloclasticus and halophilic methylotrophic Methylophaga species are members of the Piscirickettsiaceae. Methylococcales are present at much higher levels in this sample than in samples from similar depths. The elevated abundance of Thiotrichales and Methylococcales in this samples could be indicative of active release of methane and other hydrocarbon compounds into the water column above the North Alex Mud Volcano. The increased abundance of known hydrocarbon degraders as well as a distinct community structure directly above the mud volcano suggests that mud volcanism affects the microbial community in the overlaying waters. Further genomic work is required to better understand the role of these and Flavobacteria and other putative hydrocarbon degrading microbes in the deep-water community, especially in the water column adjacent to natural seeps. This study employed PLFA analysis and massively parallel 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine effect of water stratification and mud volcanism on the microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column. The adjacent water masses of the Mediterranean have selected for distinct microbial communities able to colonize these separate water masses. Our results contribute to the growing body of work, which demonstrates that physical factors in addition to geochemical parameters influence microbial community structure. Our results also clarify importance of the deep-water microbial communities of the Eastern Mediterranean in nitrogen cycling. In particular, the microbial community in the LIW contains a number of microbes putatively involved in nitrogen cycling and may be essential to the nitrogen cycle of the Eastern Mediterranean. Our study also demonstrated that geological phenomena such as mud volcanism drastically affect the microbial communities present in the water column by enriching for microbes known to utilize hydrocarbons and high molecular weight organic matter. These data combine to underscore the important role that physical, geological, and geochemical factors play in shaping marine microbial communities. Supporting Information Table. PLFA Data.

40404753,"[Ultrastructural description of Euglena pailasensis (Euglenozoa) from Rincón de la Vieja volcano, Guanacaste, Costa Rica].","The euglenoids are unicellular eukaryotic flagellates living in a diversity of soils and aquatic environments and ecosystems. This study describes the ultrastructure of an euglenoid isolated from the surface of a boiling mud pool with temperatures ranging from 38 to 98 degrees C and pH 2 - 4. The hot mud pool is located in Area de Pailas de Barro, Las Pailas, Rincón de la Vieja Volcano, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The morphological characterization of the Euglena pailasensis was performed by SEM and TEM. It was determined that, although the euglenoid was obtained from an extreme volcanic environment, the general morphology corresponds to that of a typical member of Euglena of 30-45 microm long and 8-10 microm wide, with membrane, pellicle, chloroplasts, mitochondria, nucleus, pigments and other cytoplasmic organelles. E. pailasensis is delimited by a membrane and by 40 to 90 pellicle strips. It was observed up to 5 elongated chloroplasts per cell. The chloroplast contains several osmiophilic globules and a pyrenoid penetrated by few thylakoid pairs. The nutritious material is reserved in numerous small paramylon grains located at the center of the cell, mitocondria are characterized by the presence of crests in radial disposition toward the interior of the lumen. It was also observed around the external surface ""pili"" like filaments originating from the pellicle strips. There is no evidence for the presence of flagella in the ampulla (reservoir/canal area), a fact confirmed by negative staining, and a difference regarding other species of Euglena. The observed ultrastructural characteristics are not sufficient to explain the adaptation of this species to acid and hot environments.",N/A,Ethel Sánchez,2004,17357397,N/A
215076876,CO2 flux from Javanese mud volcanism,N/A,"The concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere is a result of anthropogenic and natural CO 2 sources and sinks. Natural sources include biogenic and geological processes such as metamorphic breakdown of carbonates and magmatic degassing. Our quantitative understanding of the global geochemical carbon cycle is underpinned by empirical observations of the fluxes of CO 2 produced by geological processes [Le Cloarec and Marty, 1993; Burton et al., 2013; Kelemen and Manning, 2015] . Magmatic emissions from volcanic centers represent one of the key geological sources of CO 2 [Olivier et al., 1996; Gerlach et al., 2002; Etiope et al., 2007 , Burton et al., 2013 Lee et al., 2016] . Mud volcanism (MV) is produced by a combination of fault structures and sedimentary layers, often in back-arc areas, which produce CO 2 that is usually of a combined biogenic and geological origin. MV is the result of liquefied sediments and gases reaching the surface due to overpressure and buoyancy [Milkov, 2000; Dimitrov, 2002] . MV is a common feature in tectonically active regions with a predominantly compressive setting, such as in subduction zones. Thousands of mud volcanoes have been identified offshore [Milkov, 2000] , and at least hundreds exist onshore [Kopf, 2002] . Their sheer number implies that subaerial MV may contribute significantly to the atmospheric CO 2 budget and hence the geochemical carbon cycle. Furthermore, owing to their common proximity to volcanic arcs, they may play a key role in the overall picture of back-arc CO 2 emissions associated with arc volcanism, together with fore-arc and arc volcano degassing [Füri et al., 2010 , Giammanco et al., 2007 Westbrook and Smith, 1983] . Therefore, studying the role of volcanoes in the global carbon cycle should include investigating CO 2 emissions produced by MV. If CO 2 emitted by MV has a magmatic origin, the budget of mantle-derived CO 2 emitted by volcanism may have to be amended and models that describe carbon transfer from slab to mantle wedge and exosphere updated [Kerrick and Connolly, 2001; Connolly, 2005; Gorman et al., 2006; Poli et al., 2009] . The Indonesian archipelago located in the southern edge of Sundaland in Southeast Asia is extraordinarily rich for both arc volcanism and MV [Barber et al., 1986] . However, relatively limited CO 2 emission data are available. CO 2 emissions from these sources may contribute significantly to the country's total carbon emission, in addition to those of anthropogenic origin. Therefore, in addition to purely scientific goals, motivations to quantify natural CO 2 emission rates are hazard management and policy making regarding controls on Indonesian carbon emissions. Measuring gas emission rates (mass fluxes) requires gas concentration profiles and the transport speed of the emitted gas. Owing to high background atmospheric concentrations, CO 2 concentration profiles are usually obtained from grids of in situ measurements [e.g., Brantley and Koepenick, 1995; Shinohara, 2005; Hernández et al., 2015] . These techniques are often time consuming and, especially at volcanic sites and mud volcanoes, bear a safety risk. Remote sensing techniques provide a safe distance and a spatially integrated measurement, yielding gas concentration profiles that can directly be used to compute gas fluxes. Remote sensing is an established technique to measure volcanic SO 2 fluxes [Stoiber et al., 1983; Oppenheimer et al., 1998; Burton et al., 2000; Duffell et al., 2001; Galle et al., 2003] and, along with in situ data of CO 2 concentration, is used in a routine fashion to indirectly retrieve volcanic CO 2 fluxes [Gerlach et al., 1998; Burton et al., 2013] . LIDAR technology has recently advanced sufficiently to allow direct remote sensing of volcanic CO 2 fluxes, independent of sunlight [Aiuppa et al., 2015; Queißer et al., 2016] . In this study CO 2 from the Bledug Kuwu mud volcano complex located in Central Java, Indonesia, was probed using a novel, portable CO 2 LIDAR. The large volume of mud extruded by this mud volcano limited access to the main vent area, making CO 2 flux determinations using in situ CO 2 measurement techniques challenging. This setting was therefore deemed ideal for a remote sensing instrument and, in particular, our recently developed CO 2 LIDAR system [Queißer et al., 2016] , due to its flexibility, portability, and ease of use. The motivation for the campaign was twofold. First, the Bledug Kuwu MV complex underwent sampling of gas emission and composition [Mazzini et al., 2012] , but CO 2 fluxes have yet not been measured and a connection to arc volcanism has yet not been discussed. Second, the measurement offered a possibility to deploy a manportable active remote sensing instrument developed for volcanic CO 2 detection for the first time at a mud volcano. Bledug Kuwu is an active mud volcano located near the village of Kuwu in Central Java (Figure 1 ) in the backarc region of the Java subduction system [Whittaker et al., 2007] . The subduction process and its associated arc volcanism shape the topography of Java . A lateral cross section of a subduction zone typically reveals a systematic series of components in the landward direction: accretionary prism, fore-arc basin, arc volcanism, and back-arc region. In Java the geometry of the back-arc regions varies but it generally forms an elongated E-W basin to the north of the volcanic arc. The basin is filled by rapid sedimentation of terrigenous material [Smyth et al., 2005] . Persistent compressive stresses deformed the sediments, developing an imbrication of fold and reverse faults observable today. The topography of the back-arc region in the central and eastern part of Java is dominated by the prominent fold and thrust belt of Kendeng (Figure 1 ). Rapid sedimentation combined with the increasing stress from the subduction and vertical loading from the magmatic bodies creates favorable condition for the formation of MV [Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] . This is the area where Bledug Kuwu and other mud volcanoes are located, confined within a low relief zone. Within a radius of~2 km around Bledug Kuwu are four other mud volcanoes: Cangkring Bleduk, Bleduk Banjarsari, Bleduk Crewek, and Medang Kamolan [Istadi et al., 2012] . The nearest active volcano is Mount Lawu, located about 60 km to the south of Bledug Kuwu as part of the volcanic arc (Figure 1 ). The Bledug Kuwu mud volcano complex forms a low relief, nearly flat surface, about 700 m in diameter. The low relief of the crater and the dome indicates that the material is dominated by low viscosity sediments and that the fluidity of the material is maintained by the release of liquid and gasses [Istadi et al., 2012] . The active vent system consists of at least three eruption centers. Two main vents produce infrequent bursts of gas bubbles piercing the mud surface, forming semispherical shapes under the layer of mud, which then burst, splattering mud in all directions (Figure 2 ). Eruptions appear infrequent but occur at least twice a minute. The plume emitted at the main vents consists mainly of condensed water vapor that can be observed when the bubbles explode (Figure 2 ). The explosion is followed by a quasi-concentric movement of the plume front away from the center of the vent (Movie S1 in the supporting information) forming a ring pattern. Seismic reflection profiles reveal that the disturbed zone associated with Bledug Kuwu is produced by the upper part of Kujung formation passing Wonocolo formation and breaking onto the surface [Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] . Analysis of microfossils contained within the solid material extruded by Bledug Kuwu indicates that the source of the mud is located in the lower part of late Miocene Wonocolo shales about 2 km deep [ Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] . However, the seismic reflection data leave room for the possibility that the mud stems from early Miocene Tuban shales from 3 to 4 km depth.  The measurements at the Bledug Kuwu mud volcano field took place between the afternoon of the 27 September 2016 and morning of the 28 September 2016. The zone around the main vent of the mud field was probed using a purpose-built active laser remote sensing spectrometer, the CO 2 LIDAR [Queißer et al., 2016] . It uses an~1 W tunable near-infrared laser to illuminate a topographic feature behind the emitted gas and a receiver telescope to collect the backscattered radiation while the laser is tuned across a CO 2 absorption band at 1.57 μm. Figure 3a shows a map of Bledug Kuwu and the points where the instrument was located for the acquisitions. An earlier version of the CO 2 LIDAR has been described in detail in Queißer et al. [2016] , but continuous development of the instrument means that the version used on Bledug Kuwu has some key differences. The remote sensing spectrometer consists of a main unit (Figure 3b ) and the transmitter/receiver unit (TX/RX unit). The latter composes of the telescope, transmitter, and an integrating sphere for power reference measurement. A main difference to the previous instrument is that instead of interlacing two wavelengths on and off the CO 2 line, the CO 2 absorption line was sampled at 20 wavelengths by tuning the laser across the absorption line, such that the absorption maximum was located at the center of the wavelength sweep. A model absorption spectrum, the product of a background polynomial and the CO 2 transmittance curve, was fitted to the 20 measured transmittances resulting in a best estimate of the pathaveraged CO 2 concentration. As shown by Abshire et al. [2010] , this not only yielded additional information in terms of changes in baseline compared with the two-wavelength approach but also proved to be more robust to spectroscopic wavelength shifts and instrumental offsets due to wavelength dependencies (e.g., transmittance of instrument). In addition, for each retrieved value of CO 2 concentration an individual  Δσ is the molecular absorption cross sections of CO 2 associated with the wavelength corresponding to the absorption peak minus the absorption cross sections for the wavelength at minimum absorption (differential absorption cross section). F depicts the best fit transmittance, i.e., the fit of the transmittance values SR j measured at given wavelengths λ j (i.e., the spectrum). At a given wavelength, the spectrum was retrieved as where N S is the number of spectra to stack (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio) and S and R represent the strength of the atmospheric return and the transmitted signal, respectively, measured at 20 discrete wavelengths λ j ∈ [1, 20]. Although not used for the flux retrieval, for illustrative purposes, column-averaged path-averaged CO 2 mixing ratio (in ppm) were obtained from the column densities using where N air (in m ) is the dry air number density computed with knowledge of specific humidity, air pressure, and temperature and r depicts the range to the hard target. The CO 2 flux was computed as where u refers to the component of the plume transport speed perpendicular to the plane of the CO 2 concentration profile, i.e., the component perpendicular to the plane of the scan. M CO2 is the molar mass of CO 2 (in kg mol ) and N A is Avogadro's constant (in mol ). The constant scan angle increment Δβ was retrieved using the start and stop angles β S and β E of the scan as where N Spec depicts the total number of averaged spectra acquired during the scan. N col pl is the background-corrected CO 2 column density (the plume column density) obtained as bg , where N col bg is the background (ambient) CO 2 column density. r i is the range for spectrum i (or angle i as there was one average spectrum per angle). In the present case where the CO 2 LIDAR was placed on a tower and was scanning vertically, the angles were tilt angles and the range was computed as r i ¼ where h is the height of the instrument over ground (height of the tower) and To obtain u, the video tracking method described in detail in Queißer et al. [2016] was used. 10.1002/2017JB013968 Using error propagation, for a given scanning angle i (for clarity this index is omitted in the following equations), the uncertainty of the column-averaged mixing ratio was calculated as The uncertainty of the CO 2 flux was evaluated using where the range uncertainty Δr was estimated as (vertical scans only) where Δh is the uncertainty of h and σ β is the standard deviation of the tilt angle over the integration time per angle and is a measure of the steadiness (or linearity) of the tilt angle versus time. σ β is significant as the scans were carried out manually. σ β was retrieved from the asymptotic error of the linear fit of the recorded tilt angles over time. Since the stop angle did vary between scans, a bias Δβ bias that takes this variation into account was added. The bias was estimated as follows. The angle at which the signal disappeared indicated the last useful data; since near 0 tilt angle the beam started to overshoot the trees at the opposite edge of the MV complex used as hard target. That means that the stop angle (last angle of data with signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) ≥1) varied between À0.43 and À0.27°, adding a systematic error of Δβ bias = 0.17°. For a given angle i, the measurement precision ΔN col in equation (7) was calculated as described in Queißer et al. [2016] . In addition, it contains a variance accounting for the spectrum fitting error. This variance was retrieved as follows. The covariance matrix diagonal element corresponding to the best fit column density was, after taking the square root, scaled with the residual standard deviation of the fit (root-mean-square error). The uncertainty of the plume CO 2 column density in equation (8) was estimated as where σ N col bg is the standard deviation of the mean ambient column density used as a bias estimate that contributes to the uncertainty of the plume CO 2 column density.  The CO 2 LIDAR was placed on a platform about 200 m away from the center of the mud volcano to measure background ambient CO 2 (Figures 3a and 3b ). The ambient CO 2 concentration was obtained by measuring CO 2 column densities at the edge of the mud volcano field using trees at 280 m distance as a topographic target (the instrument was not scanned). The resulting column density was found to be N col bg = 2.74 × 10 24 m , which corresponds to a background CO 2 gas concentration of 410 ppm (equation (3)) with a precision of σ N col bg = 20 ppm. This is in agreement with expected background atmospheric concentrations. Just before the measurements commenced, the onboard range finder LIDAR of the CO 2 LIDAR ceased to function due to humidity-related problems. This means that ranges could not be measured on site. As a solution, distances were retrieved in the postprocessing using Google Earth software and visual recognition of the topographic features that were used as backscattering sources.  The measurement strategy was focussed on measuring the gas flux produced by the main vent associated with bursting gas bubbles. The telescope was aligned such that its optical axis passed just above the height where ejected gas bubbles reached, i.e.,~1.2 m above ground. The time between the burst of the bubble (release of gas started) and the end of the ejection (bubble disappeared) was typically between 1 and 3 s (Figure 2 ). To resolve these events, but ensure adequate averaging, the integration time was set to 0.5 s, corresponding to 10 spectra (sweep rate 20 Hz) being averaged (stacked) per retrieved CO 2 concentration value (i.e., per scan angle). This integration time was used for all measurements. Figure 4 shows an example of a fitted spectrum used to compute CO 2 column densities or mixing ratios (equations (1)- (3)). Every 2 to 20 s or so a gas bubble was produced by the mud volcano, ejecting gases, including water vapor and CO 2 , as well as mud. As the absorption strength of the ejected fluids and gases strongly varied the beam was sometimes blocked by mud leading to poorly recovered spectra. Using the approximate bubble diameter and the bubble frequency, a rough estimate of the expected CO 2 flux was obtained from where f bubble depicts the bubble burst frequency, d the bubble diameter, X CO2;bubble the volume ratio of CO 2 inside the bubble, and V m the molar volume of CO 2 . Although temperatures at seeps at Bledug Kuwu were found to be between 28 and 30°C [Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] , which is basically equal to the air temperature in that area, the presence of condensed water in the bursting bubbles indicated that the water was boiling and in the vapor phase with associated temperatures of at least 100°C when it reached the surface, in agreement with observations from Mazzini et al. [2012] . Flickering air in an~2 m thick layer just above ground moreover indicated advection of hot air (> 30°C ambient temperature). Thus, to compute the molar volume of the gas inside the bubble just before bursting a temperature of 100°C was considered. Half-spherically shaped bubbles were assumed. The bubble diameter was obtained from calibrated video footage (the same as used for the plume speed retrieval) and was ranging from 1.9 to 3.4 m (average 2.5 m). The main vent has Figure 4 . Spectrum acquired at Bledug Kuwu. Shown is the observed spectrum measured at 20 points (stack of 10 spectra, integration time 0.5 s) and the best fit transmittance. Figure 5. Static measurement of CO 2 from bursting bubbles. The graph shows path-averaged CO 2 concentrations from a static measurement performed on the 27 September 2016, aiming~1.2 m above ground, just above the bubble explosions, which occurred~200 m away from the CO 2 LIDAR. The instrument was located at position 1 (Figure 3a) . The standard deviation of the mixing ratios (error bars) varies and is on average 31 ppm as derived with equation (7) using a range uncertainty of 20 m. There were bursts at least 8 times per minute. The blue bars indicate an example ensemble of visually confirmed bursts. The major peak at 13:03:20 is related to at least eight bubble explosions. The dotted line indicates the ambient CO 2 mixing ratio of 410 ppm.  been probed for 30 min out of which Figure 5 shows about 10 min. The time series suggests that the volume of ejected CO 2 was very variable, which was also indicated by the inconstant sizes of the bursting bubbles. Note that due to the limited field of view of the telescope (~0.6 m at bubble), which was passing the bubbles at~1 m horizontal distance, and the dispersion of the CO 2 , the bubble bursts identified visually do not necessarily coincide with the concentration peaks in Figure 5 . However, as the larger concentration peaks likely correspond to larger bubbles (or clusters of fast occurring bubble bursts) they should coincide more than the smaller peaks. Automatically counting the peaks associated with CO 2 mixing ratios above average ambient mixing ratio plus twice the standard deviation (2σ N col bg ¼ 40 ppm) yielded a bubble burst frequency of 0.15 ± 0.04 s À1 or 9 ± 2.4 per minute. This is consistent with the estimated frequency of 7.5 explosions per minute from visual observation using the video footage. The bubbles were assumed to contain CO 2 only (i.e., bubble volume ratio X CO2;bubble = 1), yielding an upper limit flux of 0.9 ± 0.5 kg s À1 , just for the main vent, where for the uncertainty in bubble frequency and diameter is accounted for. Note that mainly due to the assumption of a single bubble bursting at a time and the semispherical shape assumption, this is a rough estimate merely yet providing an order of magnitude estimate of the CO 2 output of Bledug Kuwu. Since the gas plume advected horizontally, horizontal scanning of the plume was not adequate to retrieve the CO 2 flux, but it yielded valuable information about the shape and extension of the plume. Six consecutive scans were performed from two different instrument locations near each other (Figure 3a ). Since the forest behind the mud volcano complex was used as a hard target, using Google Earth and the start and stop heading angle of the scans, the ranges could be reconstructed. This resulted in a larger range uncertainty, which was considered 20 m for all ranges (error assessment follows in discussion). The TX/RX unit was rotated around the vertical axis with a velocity of 4 mrad/s (0.24°/s), corresponding tõ 80 cm/s at the vent location, and was scanning the main vent (position 1, Figure 3a ). The beam propagated 1.5 m above ground, which means that it would pass undisturbed by most of the aerosols and mud expelled from the bubble bursts below it but would probe the gas expelled by the bubble. For some heading angles the laser may have been scattered not by the trees but by small water droplets or mud around the location of the vent. The resulting CO 2 mixing ratios are shown in Figure 6a . The sector associated with the circular zone of CO 2 propagating from the main vent outward corresponds to the angles between about 17°and 36°, associated with a lateral dimension of~60 m. Interestingly, the minor vent (vent III, Figure 3a ), which coincides with the twin peak near 30°has associated mixing ratios of magnitude equal to those near the main peak at 20°(associated with vent II). The oscillations between 41°and 50°are likely due to a changing hard target distance (such as tree lines at closer distance), which was difficult to discern without on-site range data. Mixing ratios far below the ambient level may indicate short ranges and that the beam was reflected by flying debris or dense condensed water vapor. The data were not omitted as the spectra were well recovered. A repeated scan from a point 40 m close to the first instrument location (position 2, Figure 3a) showed a symmetrically decaying CO 2 concentration peak for the location of the main vent (10°, Figure 6b ). As opposed to  the scan before in Figure 6a , the CO 2 mixing ratio for vent III (near 17°) is not very high. However, there are peaks near 3 and 4°, which correspond to the zone~16 to 18 m west of the main vent (II). This area was in immediate reach of the concentric waves of gas emerging from the main vent, which have likely caused these peaks. To obtain the CO 2 flux, the CO 2 concentration profile perpendicular to the propagation vector of the gas plume was needed. As the gas plume propagated horizontally (Movie S1) this required a vertical scan of the plume. Due to logistical constraints, the available equipment included neither tripod nor step motor. It was therefore decided to attempt a manual scan using the handrail of an observation tower as a mechanical support. This was an opportunity to assess whether the CO 2 LIDAR would provide useful data in hand-held operation. With the TX/RX unit placed on the handrail the instrument's height above ground was h = 5.3 m. The telescope's line of sight was intersecting the plume transport direction perpendicularly (Figures 3a and 3c) . The scanning plane was located downwind,~17 m west of the main vent (II). This means that the measured flux would correspond to the combined output of vents II and III (Figure 3a ). Starting from a tilt angle of À4°(À0.07 rad), the TX/RX unit was manually moved upward so that the tilt angle was gradually increased until it reached 0. After a few trial runs the vertical scans were rather smooth, indicated by the linearity of the tilt angle with time. This is shown in Figure 3d for one of the scans along with the linear fit. The maximum asymptotic error σ β = 3 × 10 À3°/ s (0.05 mrad/s) of the linear fits of all scans was used as the tilt angle random error (standard deviation of the tilt angle, equation (9)). This corresponds to 8% of the scanning rate of 0.036°/s (0.6 mrad/s). The telescope was thus considered moving steadily. As before, spectra were acquired continuously at a rate of 20 Hz (50 ms sweep time per spectrum) and saved to disk each 0.5 s. Each tilt angle i was associated with a stack of 10 spectra (0.5 s integration time). Nine repetitions of the scan were recorded. The resulting CO 2 column densities and mixing ratios as a function of tilt angles and corresponding hard target ranges are shown in Figure 7 . Despite the irregular degassing activity, both in terms of frequency and in terms of ejected volume (varying bubble size), column-averaged maximum mixing ratios usually peak around 1500 ppm, for some scans (e.g., Figures 7a, 7c , and 7d) much higher than that, up to at least 2400 ppm. The center of the mud volcano mouth was located at a range of 230 m. Although these peaks fluctuate from scan to scan, the highest mixing ratios are predominantly found near that range, betweeñ 130 and~300 m. This range is consistent with the observed maximum water vapor plume extent, indicating the minimum radial extension of the CO 2 plume. The prevailing transport direction of the plume was toward northwest, explaining a possibly a concentric distribution of the plume. This may have led to higher CO 2 concentrations toward north, that is, toward the instrument position. It is also important to note that the X CO2 represent total column-averaged mixing ratios, which include ambient CO 2 . So with increasing range the relative contribution of the plume CO 2 to X CO2 decreases. There is a reoccurring peak near 120 m. An explanation could be that due to the reoccurrence of bubble explosions, peaks farther away from the vent stemmed from previous bubble explosions seconds before. On the video (Movie S1) this is revealed by concentric waves of condensed water vapor overriding each other as they propagate along the ground. The same was probably true for the CO 2 . The column density remains high after the bubble center (after~270 m). Note that the range increased nonlinearly with tilt angle, which means that the associated column densities correspond to much lower CO 2 mixing ratios (Figure 7) . Assuming an air density of~1.2 kg m À3 , even at a gas temperature of 100°C upon exiting the vent, the CO 2 density would still have been higher than the air density. The CO 2 therefore would have still not been buoyant but held down by gravity. However, the instrument might well have been probing plume CO 2 at ranges >400 m, due to the quasi-steady supply by the vents and the fact that for a given vertical scanning angle the laser beam height above ground geometrically decreased (Figure 3c ). For instance, for the given range of r = 660 m, the height above ground for 230 m, 300 m, and 400 m away from the instrument was 4.7 m, 3.3 m, and 2.5 m, respectively. This is of the order of the bubble diameter. The vertical plume velocity component was zero. The horizontal transport speed was remarkably constant and associated with a constant progression of the plume fronts emanating from the center of the puddle (the bubble burst zone), which were tracked. A single value for the plume speed resulting from the For each scan the CO 2 flux was computed using equation (4) and the uncertainties using equation (8). The results are presented in Table 1 . The average flux of all nine scans is 1.4 ± 0.8 kg s À1 or 117 ± 68 t d or 43 kt yr . It agrees with the flux estimated for vent II of 0.9 ± 0.5 kg s À1 using equation (11). Note that 1.4 kg s accounts for both vents II and III. However, the video footage revealed that bubble explosions at vent III were at least 20 times less frequent and the bubble diameter is about 3 times smaller, implying that, given the error bars, 1.4 kg s À1 represents the flux of the main vent II to first order.  The SNR contributed an uncertainty of~2% of the column density, whereas the fit contribution varied Figure 7 . (a-i) CO 2 column densities and converted mixing ratios for the vertical scans. The scans were acquired on the 28 September 2016 between 7 h11 and 7 h47 A.M. local time. They are presented in the order they were carried out. Each scan took~1 min and was spanning the complete extension of the mud volcano field. The column densities resulting from these scans were used to compute the CO 2 fluxes in Table 1 . The grey shaded area depicts the ambient CO 2 mixing ratio of 410 ppm.   between 4% of the column density for a smooth spectrum and 20% for a noisy spectrum. The resulting relative uncertainty of N col pl was between 4% and 30%, mainly depending on the quality of the fit, which in some cases dominated the uncertainty. For the vertical scans, the fit error alone contributed an uncertainty of the CO 2 flux of 44% on average. Highest fit errors are produced from relatively noisy spectra collected in the near and the very far range measurements. For the shorter ranges (< 150 m) speckle noise contributes significantly [Queißer et al., 2016] . For the longer ranges the angle increment Δβ produced a field of view, which included a wide topographic target range (e.g.,~0.5 m near 0.07 rad versus~25 m near 0.01 rad). Along with bushes and trees that were found near the edge of the mud volcano this significantly altered the target reflectivity during each sweep, producing an additional interfering signal in the transmittance spectra. Furthermore, it was raining during the vertical scans (see Movie S1). Other than an increased light extinction and thus noisy spectra, particularly for the longer ranges, this gave rise to an angle-dependent noise contribution [Roy and Bissonette, 2001] . Water puddles at places produced reflectivity patterns of small-scale (~m) heterogeneity (mud versus water) that could have introduced noise in the spectra, especially those collected at longer range. One should also mention that the relatively short integration time of 0.5 s (stack of 10 subsequent spectra) was contributing to a rather high fitting error. On the other hand, a short integration time was needed to account for the plume dynamics, so that the ""frozen plume"" assumption holds. As far as the range error is concerned, for the horizontal scans and the static measurement, the lack of range data entailed an increase in range uncertainty from <1 m (with the range finder) to 20 m. For the vertical scans the range uncertainty is accounted for by the angle uncertainty (equation (9)). For the horizontal scans the increase in range uncertainty corresponded to an increase in uncertainty of the CO 2 mixing ratios of up to 40%, depending on the range and relative error of the column density (equation (7)). For the vertical scans, the lack of the range finder entailed an increase in flux uncertainty between 5% (scan d) and 10% (scan a). Temperature and pressure uncertainties cause an uncertainty in differential absorption cross section, which contributes to the error of the CO 2 column density. The pressure was steady. Assuming a realistic temperature uncertainty of 2 K, the error of N col pl due to temperature uncertainty was only 0.3% and hence was neglected. Given that the Bledug Kuwu is a local tourist destination and visitors approach the main vent as close as 20 m (based on our observation), it is beneficial to assess CO 2 emissions from a health and safety perspective. Measured CO 2 mixing ratios in the vicinity of the main vent (~80 m around the crater) were found to reach up to 2400 ppm, that is, averaged over the path length (Figure 7) . In terms of personal health and safety this value is well below the threshold of 5000 ppm per 8 h exposure [EH40/2005 [EH40/ , 2011 . A high-risk columnaveraged concentration (> 15,000 ppm over 15 min) would only be caused if there was an area of a few meter size with nearly pure CO 2 , for instance, a 2.5 m path (to take the average size of a bubble) consisting of 90% CO 2 . The retrieved CO 2 flux of 117 t d À1 is in line with that measured at the LUSI mud volcano, also located in the Kendeng Basin, 180 km east of Bledug Kuwu (Figure 1) , which was reported to be between 35 and 160 t d À1 [Vanderkluysen et al., 2014] . This order of magnitude of CO 2 flux compares with the lower end of volcanic emission rates, such as Vulcano, Italy [Gerlach et al., 1997] , and, by itself, is dwarfed by the anthropogenic carbon emissions in Indonesia, which are of the order of 274 kt d À1 (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/ido.html). For a comparable emission rate, hundreds of Bledug Kuwu-like emitters would be necessary. It is not straightforward to provide an estimate of the total CO 2 flux of Javanese back-arc MV since there is no comprehensive summary of all Javanese MV, and the number of MV in the literature is inconsistent between different sources [Satyana and Asnydar, 2008; Guntoro, 2011] . Moreover, MV may sometimes not be defined as such. For instance, Kamojang, located in Western Java, is characterized as a geothermal field with mud pods [Setijadji, 2010] . In addition, the CO 2 content of the gas emitted by Javanese MV generally varies strongly. For example, the molecular composition observed for gas emitted by different MV near LUSI varied between <1% and 99 vol % of CO 2 [Mazzini et al., 2012] . Nevertheless, encouraged by the similarity of the CO 2 flux between LUSI and Bledug Kuwu, we attempt at least an order of magnitude estimation. A  conservative number of Java's subaerial MV is 28, of which 23 are located in the eastern half of Java (Table 2) . The highest MV density is found in the province of East Java. Extrapolating the fluxes of LUSI and Bledug Kuwu on all Javanese MV yields an order of magnitude CO 2 flux of 3 kt d . Mount Merapi's CO 2 flux is 600 t d À1 (vented + diffuse slope degassing) during quiescent periods [Toutain et al., 2009] . Extrapolating this value over the 20 or so, actively degassing Javanese arc volcanoes yields a ballpark figure of 12 kt d À1 for the CO 2 emitted by Javenese arc volcanism. This implies that the extrapolated CO 2 flux from Javanese back-arc MV accounts for 3/12 or 25% of the CO 2 flux from arc volcanism in Java. In general, the back-arc diffuse degassing of magmatic carbon is estimated to account for roughly 26% of the carbon flux of arc volcanoes at subduction zones [Kelemen and Manning, 2015] . If assumed that backarc outgassing of magmatic carbon occurs mainly via CO 2 , this suggests that the extrapolated mass of carbon emitted by Javanese MV is comparable with the mass emitted by back-arc diffuse outgassing (not emitted by arc volcanoes). The question arises whether some of the CO 2 emitted by the back-arc MV is of magmatic origin. Here we examine possible sources of CO 2 emitted at Bledug Kuwu. We highlight that our data do not permit an unequivocal conclusion with regard to CO 2 sources; however, the key mechanisms can be examined and compared. A major constituent of the gas emitted at Bledug Kuwu is water vapor. This is apparent from visual observation of the bubbles, which upon bursting produce abundant condensed water vapor fumes (Figure 2 ), suggesting decompression of water vapor to drive the explosions. The fact that one can observe a point source of expelled CO 2 and since the CO 2 is expelled along with water suggests that CO 2 was originally dissolved in water in the saturated zone. In this sense the eruption can be modeled and characterized as a geyser. We therefore adopt the conceptual model of a geyser [Lu et al., 2005] , which consists of a conduit between the surface and an underground chamber where liquid is heated, decreases in density, and ascends up the conduit to the surface, boiling during ascent. Such a conduit is consistent with the general understanding of mud volcanoes as soft matter migrating toward the surface through low-pressure channels in the form of liquid mud diapirs and gas. The eruption mode at Bledug Kuwu is similar to LUSI [Mazzini et al., 2012] and can be characterized by a churn flow regime, that is, a multiphase gas flow with interacting bubbles upon boiling [Vanderkluysen et al., 2014] . CO 2 is considered to have been dissolved in the aquifer water before exsolving during ascent or in a shallow storage zone. It is assumed that all water evaporates completely upon the bubble explosion, so that all CO 2 separates from the water. The molar ratio between water vapor and CO 2 observed after the bubble explosion therefore represents, to first order, the molar ratio in the subsurface when CO 2 was dissolved in the water. In addition to water vapor and CO 2 , mud volcanoes may emit methane and other gases. Since our CO 2 LIDAR measured CO 2 only, trace gas compositions of the bubble could not be analyzed. Mazzini et al. [2012] reported, however, that the gas expelled at Bledug Kuwu is dominated by CO 2 . This is in line with Satyana and Asnidar [2008] , who stated that the emitted gases at Bledug Kuwu have been reported to be mainly H 2 O and CO 2 with traces of H 2 S. We therefore assume that the methane content of the gases expelled at Bledug Kuwu is present in low amounts and it is not considered in our mass balance calculation. The ejected liquid is thus treated as a two-phase mixture of muddy water and a gas phase of water vapor and CO 2 . Using equation (11) and plugging in the flux obtained with the CO 2 LIDAR and solving for X CO2;bubble yields a CO 2 volume fraction of 1. The inputs for equation (11) have significant uncertainties. Considering the maximum error caused by the uncertainties of the flux, bubble diameter and bubble frequency yield that a minimum fraction of 0.16 of the volume of the ejected bubbles at the main vent at Bledug Kuwu was occupied by pure CO 2 . Considering that both CO 2 and water vapor are at the same temperature and pressure implies that their molar ratio is at least 16:84 or 0.19. For simplicity we consider that all the CO 2 is dissolved in brine up to a certain depth (and pressure). Then Henry's law can be employed together with the molar ratio of H 2 O vapor and CO 2 gas to estimate the subsurface pressure at which CO 2 exsolved from the brine. A gas temperature of 100°C upon piercing the surface is considered here. Considering a water density of 1030 kg/m 3 using the relationship of Crovetto [1991] , the Henry volatility constant is retrieved as 96 L atm mol . Neglecting the fact that the salt content in the brine decreases solubility and that the molar ratio of 0.19 of CO 2 is a lower limit and considering the geothermal gradient with temperatures at the Kendang base likely higher than 300°C [Nurhandoko et al., 2016; Putra et al., 2016] yields a pressure of at least~106 MPa or a minimum dissolution depth of 10 km. The large negative gravity anomaly of the Kendeng zone indicates a deep sedimentary basin with an average sediment thickness of~6 km that may reach down to 10 km below where Bledug Kuwu is located [Untung and Sato, 1978; Waltham et al., 2008] . It is therefore possible that the CO 2 observed at Bledug Kuwu originated from the basement of the Kendeng Basin or from below. Mazzini et al. [2012] noted that samples taken at different vents at mud volcano sites may exhibit different isotopic signatures, suggesting mixed sources of CO 2 . For instance, at LUSI three samples suggested volcanic origin of the CO 2 , while the majority of samples taken at LUSI pointed toward an organic origin of CO 2 . Setijadji [2010] considered Bledug Kuwu not being linked to a volcanic center. This is supported by the reported δ 13 C of the CO 2 of À18.8‰ measured at Bledug Kuwu, which indicates an organic origin of the CO 2 , such as from decarboxylation of kerogen [Mazzini et al., 2012] . Potential CO 2 source rocks include the kerogene bearing, 4400 m deep Ngimbang rock formation [Mazzini et al., 2012] , and the deeper Paleocene pre-Ngimbang formation [Satyana and Purwaningsih, 2003; Wiloso et al., 2009] . The corresponding depth region near the base of the Kendeng Basin (Eocene) is, however, poorly studied and leaves room for alternative sources. As it is located in a setting favorable for hydrocarbon production [Satyana and Purwaningsih, 2003; Wiloso et al., 2009] , it is remarkable that Bledug Kuwu is dominated by emission of CO 2 rather than methane. This advocates the prospect that at least to some extent the CO 2 may originate from oxidation of methane via reduction of pyrite and SO 4 [Seewald et al., 1994; Mazzini et al., 2012] . Java is located in a tectonically active region with extensive deformation observed throughout the arc. Thrusting once displaced some of the early Cenozoic volcanic arc to which Mount Muria belongs northward (Figure 1) . Central Java hosts a series of these northward directed thrusts [Clements et al., 2009] . Bledug Kuwu and other MV of Central Java are mainly located along the NE-SW Kendeng Fault, which is dominated by thrusting. Some of the folds and thrusts are torn by strike-slip faults oriented obliquely to the trend of the thrust fault and fold axis. Many of the mud volcanoes are found in the intersection of these structures. The association of mud volcanoes with these structures suggests that faulting and folding are the chief control of MV emplacement in the region [Setijadji, 2010; Roberts et al., 2011] . These faults on Java are potentially acting as a pathway for hydrothermal fluids to the surface [Mazzini et al., 2014] . It is peculiar that some of the MV are methane dominated and associated with colder temperatures <100°C [Mazzini et al., 2012] , while the CO 2 -dominated MV emissions are hot, such as Bledug Kuwu and LUSI. A CO 2 dissolution depth of 10 km or more below Bledug Kuwu would likely be in reach of rising volcanic fluids. This raises the possibility that in the Bledug Kuwu case an igneous intrusion or magma storage zone may be both a source of heat and CO 2 , leaking into the sedimentary basin through fractures. Mazzini et al. [2012] postulated the occurrence of a magma chamber at 6 km depth that may interact with sediments at the base of the Kendeng Basin. Earthquake attenuation tomography is capable of outlining zones of high attenuation and seismic velocity anomaly, such as caused by magma. Bohm et al. [2013] performed seismic attenuation tomography using arrivals from earthquakes down to 200 km depth below Central Java. The model resolution of 15 km vertical and 30 km horizontal was too coarse to help differentiate between zones of high temperature, such as magma intrusions, and the water-saturated sediments of the Kendeng Basin, which also strongly attenuate seismic energy. Their models suggested fluid-saturated sediments down to 15 km depth at the Kendeng Basin. The findings, however, did not indicate a large-scale, high attenuation channel between partial melt zones of the volcanic centers (<15 km to 30 km depth) and the Kendeng Basin, which would imply pathways for magma, partial melts or CO 2 rich fluids. In line with the high attenuation at the location of the Kendeng Basin, passive seismic velocity tomography performed by Koulakov et al. [2007 and and active seismic tomography carried out by Wagner et al. [2007] indicated the occurrence of a strong low-velocity anomaly (Merapi Lawu anomaly, MLA) north of the volcanic arc, reaching at least until Mount Lawu to the east (Figure 1) . They explained the anomaly by Basin contains brine-saturated sediments and shales (e.g., Wonocolo and Ngimbang). Beneath Bledug Kuwu an upward convex mud diapir (not to scale) is fed by brine-saturated sediment layers. As they cool, partial melts and volcanic liquids pond beneath the basin basement or enter the basin via faults. Between 15 and 11 km depth CO 2 could exolve from the partial melt, potentially migrate through faults, and dissolve into sediment brine, which moves upward. As depth decreases the mud diapir forms. With pressure decreasing, close to the surface, the uprising muddy brine boils with large bubbles piercing the surface, releasing water vapor and CO 2 . Not shown are other potential CO 2 source mechanisms involved, such as contact metamorphism, oxydation of methane, or decarboxylation.  thick sediments, saturated with fluids and gases, and also magma and partial melts. Unlike the seismic attenuation model of Bohm et al. [2013] , their velocity models suggested the MLA to continue until the subducting slab, that is, beneath the volcanic arc at~120 km depth. Their model therefore indicates a potential pathway of magmatic CO 2 into the Kendeng Basin. It is possible that melts or partial melts reach the base of the Kendeng Basin where their temperature is lowered by relatively cold sediments of the Kendeng Basin, which are sealing off the hot volcanic fluids or allow small amounts of volcanic fluids to penetrate the sedimentary layers near the basement base [Wagner et al., 2007; Koulakov et al., 2009] . Koulakov et al. [2009] furthermore suggested the possible presence of magmatic lenses reaching up to 11 km depth. In summary, based on seismic tomography, magmatic CO 2 could indeed reach the Kendeng Basin, be dissolved in brine, and eventually be expelled via mud volcanoes. Figure 8 illustrates this possibility by showing a potential pathway of magmatic CO 2 into the mud diaper of Bledug Kuwu. But owing to the limited resolution of~15 km of the data, this remains a possibility rather than a fact. In the light of a mixed origin of the CO 2 not all of the CO 2 reaching the surface is dissolved below 10 km. More likely, an unknown amount of magmatic CO 2 , corresponding to a fraction of the measured 1.4 kg s , is dissolved at depths of 10 km or below, while biogenic and thermogenic CO 2 , dissolve at shallower depths, for instance, at~4000 m within the Ngimbang rock formation. This means that the CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio at a given depth and the nucleation depth of CO 2 bubbles are unknown. Given all evidence combined, it is likely that the CO 2 emitted at Bledug Kuwu is a mixture of thermogenic or biogenic CO 2 and magmatic CO 2 . Volcanic fluids and melts could also catalyze CO 2 production. As speculated for the alike LUSI [Mazzini et al., 2012] , rocks near the base of the Kendeng Basin could be affected by intruding magma or partial melts and, due to the heat supply, promote thermogenic production of CO 2 from the limestone basement of the basin through contact metamorphism. Although geological, geophysical, and geochemical mapping has been done for Central Java, at the current stage more confining evidence, particularly of the geochemical sort, is necessary to exclude that CO 2 expelled by Bledug Kuwu and other MV in Central Java is not of volcanic origin. A powerful yet inexpensive approach compared with, for instance, high-resolution seismic could be to measure CO 2 / 3 He ratios. Studying the quantity and origin of CO 2 emitted by back-arc mud volcanoes is important to correctly model the thermodynamics and geochemistry of arc volcanoes and to constrain their role in the carbon budget and hence the global geochemical carbon cycle. Using remote sensing laser absorption spectroscopy, an average CO 2 flux of 1.4 kg s À1 or 117 t d À1 (43 kt yr ) was found at Bledug Kuwu mud volcano. The flux stems from two of three identified main vents and thus represents a lower limit. The gas flow was characterized as a two-phase slug flow of brine and CO 2 with CO 2 dissolving at depths that may reach below 10 km. Geochemical and geological evidence suggest the CO 2 observed at Bledug Kuwu to be of biogenic or thermogenic origin. Seismic tomography, the tectonic setting, and the depth of the CO 2 origin, on the other hand, favor at least a partly magmatic origin of the CO 2 . A more focused effort, such as noble gas tracing, is needed to clarify the origin of the CO 2 released at Bledug Kuwu, in particular the contribution of magmatic CO 2 if there is any. This study not only demonstrated the merit of a man-portable active remote sensing instrument for probing natural gas releases but also showed feasibility of a hand-held scan of a gas release to obtain the gas flux, enabling efficient bottom-up estimation of CO 2 fluxes. To our knowledge, this was the first time the CO 2 flux of a mud volcano was measured using ground-based remote sensing.",M. Queißer,2017,28944134,N/A

214924177,The Unique Chemistry of Eastern Mediterranean Water Masses Selects for Distinct Microbial Communities by Depth,N/A,"Microbial diversity and activity are strongly dependent upon the environments in which microbes live [1, 2] . Localized chemistry can strongly impact microbial community structure and function [3, 4] . Environmental factors such as nutrients and temperature are important constraints on the microbes that live in a particular setting [5] [6] [7] . More recently, physical factors such as currents and oceanographic water masses have been shown to be important in dictating localized community structure [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The Mediterranean Sea has a unique chemistry with the waters being characterized by high salinity (38-39 psu relative to 35 psu in the open ocean), elevated bottom water temperatures (12-13°C relative to 4°C at similar depths and latitudes in the Atlantic) and ultraoligotrophic conditions (extreme phosphate limitation) [15] . The waters of the Eastern Mediterranean are stratified with distinct water masses present at different depths [16] . The upper water mass in the Eastern Mediterranean is the Atlantic Water (AW) occupying depths down to around 150 m. Salinity of the AW increases as it flows from the Strait of Gibraltar (*36.5 psu) to the Levantine Basin in the Eastern Mediterranean (*38.6) [16] . Below the AW, at depths between 150-400 m, is the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW). The LIW is characterized by temperatures around 15°C with high salinity (39 psu) . LIW forms in the Levantine Basin of the Eastern Mediterranean and flows at intermediate depths east to west. The Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW) occupies depths below 400 m. The water temperature of the EMDW stabilizes at approximately 13.5°C. The unique chemistry and complex oceanographic regimes of the Eastern Mediterranean may select for distinct microbial communities throughout the water column, which are adapted for growth in nutrient limited environments. The microbial communities of the Northwestern and Northeastern Mediterranean have been studied to investigate how microbes are affected by the ultraoligotrophic conditions of the Mediterranean [17, 18] . For the most part these studies have focused on particular groups of microbes and not entire communities. Two studies focusing on phototrophs, indicated that microbes adapted for growth under low nutrient conditions dominate the phototrophic community in areas under nutrient limitation [17, 18] . Metagenomic analysis of one site in the Eastern Mediterranean showed that an increased number of proteins involved in phosphate transport and processing are an important adaptation to growth under phosphate limiting conditions [19] . It has been hypothesized that the skewed N:P ratio of the Eastern Mediterranean may be due to high rates of nitrogen fixation [20, 21] . However, multiple studies have demonstrated that nitrogen fixation rates are very low in the photic zone of Eastern Mediterranean waters [22, 23] . More recent studies demonstrated that nitrogen fixation is much higher in the aphotic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean, with a larger percentage of nitrogen fixation in the Eastern Mediterranean occurring in the deep water [24] . Additional studies have investigated the changes that occur in the microbial community throughout the water column. In general bacterial numbers decrease from mid 10 5 cells/ml in the surface waters to mid 10 4 cells/ml in the bottom waters [25] . Yokokawa et al. (2010) demonstrated that there are differences in bacterial abundance and microbial community structure at different depths [25] . However, there were also localized distinctions between samples collected within the same water masses from different sampling stations. It was suggested that these site-specific differences could be attributed to local chemical differences, such as organic matter load [25] . Most of the investigations into microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column have focused on the Northeastern Mediterranean or off the coast of Israel. There is almost no information regarding the microbial community of the water column in the Southeastern Mediterranean, especially locations adjacent to the Nile River Delta. Despite limited knowledge of the microbial community in the water column adjacent to the Nile River, several studies have investigated the microbial communities in the numerous natural hydrocarbon seeps in the Nile Deep Sea fan [26] [27] [28] [29] . The Nile Deep sea fan is a sedimentary turbiditic system extending from the Nile delta into the Eastern Mediterranean [30] . Recent work has indicated that mud volcanoes are found throughout the Nile Deep-Sea Fan, the Olympia field on the Mediterranean ridge, and the Anaximander Mountains in the Northeastern Mediterranean [31, 32] . These natural seeps are hot spots of deep-sea life, and impact the diversity of microbes present in the seep-associated sediments [33] . Active mud volcanoes can emit large volumes of methane and other hydrocarbons and in turn have the potential to impact the microbial community of the water column overlaying these seeps. Several studies have investigated the microbial community in mud volcano sediments throughout the Eastern Mediterranean [26, 27, 29] . These sediment communities are known to be diverse and contain a variety of microbes involved in sulfur oxidation, methanotrophy, methylotrophy, degradation of higher hydrocarbons, and anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) [27] [28] [29] . In this study, we collected samples from the water column above the North Alex Mud Volcano in order to determine the effect of geological phenomena such as hydrocarbon seeps on structuring the microbial community of the water column. The Eastern Mediterranean is known for the stratification of the water column and the presence of a number of active mud volcanoes. Our study aims to characterize the effect of water stratification and mud volcanism on the microbial community in the water column of the Southeastern Mediterranean. We combine chemical measurement with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and massively-parallel 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize microbial abundance and diversity at five stations. PLFA analysis provides a robust measure of microbial biomass as well as insights into the physiological state of the active microbial community in a sample [34] . Lipid biomarkers can also be used as indicators for the presence of particular microbial groups [35] . 16S rRNA sequencing provides an in-depth look into which microbial taxa are present with much finer taxonomic precision than can be achieved with PLFA analysis alone. These complementary techniques were used in order to reduce the biases that any single technique would have and provide multiple lines of evidence for any conclusion [36] .  Samples were collected between 11 and 15 October 2012 at five stations in the West Nile Delta region of the Nile Deep Sea Fan aboard the MV Fugro Navigator. This work was conducted in BP's West Nile Delta Concession. No specific permits were required for collection of these samples. These field studies did not include the collection of any endangered or protected species. Temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation, pH, and turbidity were measured at each station using a Valeport Midas+ CTD (Fig. 1B and S1 Fig.) . Samples were taken from four depths based on the CTD profiles. Temperature and salinity profiles were constructed using the oce package in R [37] . One sample from each station was taken within or directly above the thermocline. One sample was taken within the region of increased salinity that occurred between 150 and 400 m. Another sample was taken at two-thirds of bottom depth. The fourth sample was collected 20 m above the sea floor. In total, 20 samples were collected (S1 Table) . These stations represented diverse sea floor features, including the North Alex Mud Volcano and the Alexandria Canyon (Station 3 and 4 respectively, Fig. 1A) . Water was collected from each depth using Niskin bottles. 100 ml of water were frozen at −20°C for analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nutrients. Forty ml of water were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C for acridine orange direct counts Maps of sampling sites were prepared using the ODV software package [38] . (B) CTD profile of Temperature and salinity for site 1 (depth 1230 m). Temperature measured in°C is shown in red. Salinity measured in Practical Salinity Units (psu) is shown in green. (C) Annotated T-S plot with data from the CTD profile of site 1. Three distinct water masses are visible below the surface mixed layer. The AW is characterized by water with salinities between 38.6 and 38.8 psu and temperatures between 16-18°C. The LIW is characterized by high salinity around 39.2 psu and temperatures around 16°C. The EMDW is characterized by waters with salinities near 38.8 and temperatures near 14°C. Visualization of CTD data was performed in R [39] using the oce package [37] . (AODC). Samples for microbial community analysis were collected using the large volume Stand Alone Particle Sampler (SAPS, Challenger Oceanic, UK with controller, battery and pump upgrades by Oceanlab, University of Aberdeen, Scotland). Between 62 and 123 L of seawater were filtered at depth through a 292 mm diameter nylon filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm (volume filtered for each sample is listed in S1 Table) . The filter was sectioned into thirds, onethird for DNA analysis, one-third for PLFA analysis, and one-third as an archive. DOC, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and inorganic nutrients were measured at the SOEST Laboratory for Analytical Biogeochemistry (University of Hawaii). DOC and TDN were measured using a Shimadzu High-Temperature TOC-L Combustion Analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan). DOC is reported as non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). Quality control testing for NPOC and TDN was conducted using purchased Deep Seawater Reference Material (DSRM) from the RSMAS Consensus Reference Materials (CRM) Project (http://yyy.rsmas.miami.edu/groups-/ biogeochem/CRM.html). Ammonia was measured fluorometrically following the method of Kerouel and Aminot (1997) [40] . Nitrate and nitrite were analyzed via the diazo reaction based on the methods of Armstrong et al (1967) [41] and Grasshoff (1983) [42] . Silicate measurement is based on the reduction of silicomolybdate in acidic solution to molybdenum blue by ascorbic acid [42] . Orthophosphate concentrations were determined based on the colorimetric method of Murphy and Riley (1962) [43] . In order to identify patterns and similarities in the physical and chemical parameters of samples from the same water mass, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of environmental data was performed in R using the prcomp command [39] . The data was centered so that the variables are shifted to be zero centered and scaled by dividing each number by the standard deviation. PERMANOVA analysis [44] was performed on a Euclidian distance of the normalized environmental data using the Adonis function in Vegan [45] . Acridine Orange Direct Cell Counts AODC were performed as described previously [46] . Water samples for direct cell counts were preserved with 4% formaldehyde and stored at 4°C until processed. Cell counts were done with Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Germany). One-third of the SAPS pump filter was stored at −80°C for PLFA analysis. The filter was transferred to a muffled glass centrifuge tube using a solvent-rinsed forceps. The total lipids were extracted using a two-phase extraction method with final ratio of methanol:chloroform:water buffer being 1:1:0.9 (v/v/v) and subsequently fractionated on a silicic acid column with only the polar lipids then transesterified into phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) methyl esters [47] . The PLFA methyl esters were separated, quantified, and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) [47] . Archaeal lipids were not analyzed. Cell counts were estimated from PLFA data using the conversion factor of 5.9 x 10 4 cells per pmole of PLFA [34] . PLFA cell counts were compared with AODC counts to determine how microbial abundance changes with depth. AODC cell counts are able to detect all types of microbial cells including Eukaryotes, Archaea and Bacteria. Alternatively, PLFA analysis will only detect Eukaryotes and Bacteria. PLFA has the advantage of providing information on viable cells only [34, 48] , whereas AODC will measure both viable and dead cells. The combination of these two methods provides a robust estimate of total and active prokaryotes in an environment. In addition to biomass estimates, PLFAs were grouped into lipid classes. The mole percent of each lipid class was determined for samples from each water mass. To test the hypothesis that lipid classes were differentially abundant in each water mass, one-way ANOVA was performed comparing the mole percent of each lipid class in samples grouped according to water mass. P values were corrected using the false discovery rate calculation in R. Tukey honest significant difference test was used to determine which water masses were significantly different from each other. The full list of lipids in each sample is presented in S2 Table. DNA Extraction, Sequencing, Analysis One-third of the SAPS filter was stored at −80°C for DNA analysis. DNA was extracted using a modified Miller DNA extraction method [49] . Quality of extracted DNA was determined by measuring 260/280 and 260/230 ratios on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Concentration of DNA was determined using picogreen (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) with universal primers 515f and barcoded 806r, which are able to amplify both Bacterial and Archaeal sequences. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq according to the protocol in Caporaso et al (2012) [50] . The resulting DNA sequences were analyzed using the QIIME version 1.8.0-dev pipeline [51] . Paired-end raw reads were assembled using fastq-join [52] . The assembled sequences were demultiplexed and quality filtered in QIIME to remove reads with phred scores below 20 (-q 19). Chimera detection was then performed on assembled reads using UCHIME [53, 54] . Assembled, qualityfiltered and chimera checked sequences were deposited at MG-RAST (http://metagenomics. anl.gov/) (accession number 4571952.3-4571971.3). Sequences were then clustered into operation taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity) with UCLUST [53] using the open reference clustering protocol. The resulting representative sequences were aligned using PyNAST [55] and given a taxonomic assignment using RDP [56] retrained with the May 2013 Greengenes release. The resulting OTU table was filtered to keep OTUs that were present at greater than 0.005%, and then rarified to 13,753 sequences per sample (the minimum number of remaining sequences in the samples). The alpha diversity of samples was determined using the Shannon, Simpson, and phylogenetic diversity (whole tree diversity) metrics. To test the hypothesis that alpha diversity was significantly different between these three water masses ANOVA and Tukey honest significant difference test were performed. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity [57] , weighted and unweighted unifrac distances [58] were calculated from the rarefied OTU table using the beta_diversity.py script in QIIME. In order to test the hypothesis that microbial communities from the same water mass were significantly similar to each other and statistically different from other water masses; hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were used. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the hclust command in the ecodist [59] package in R with a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the average linkage method. To further test this hypothesis weighted Unifrac distances were used to construct two-dimensional NMDS plots. The lowest stress configuration was chosen from 50 iterations of plot construction. Stress values were calculated using the default stress calculation in the nmds command in the ecodist package. To test if samples from the same water mass were significantly different from each other PERMA-NOVA analysis was performed on both the Bray Curtis and weighted Unifrac matrices using the Adonis function in the vegan package in R. Samples were grouped according to the water mass from which the samples were taken using the depth cutoffs as follows: AW: 10-150 m, LIW: 150-300 m, EMDW: 300-1210 m. There were five samples in the AW group, five samples in the LIW group and ten samples in the EMDW group. PERMANOVA analysis was performed using 999 permutations. PERMANOVA analysis of all three groups will indicate if there is a significant difference between all three groups. To distinguish which water masses are different from each other, PERMANOVA analysis was done on subsets of the weighted Unifrac distance matrix that only include samples from two of the three water masses. These pair-wise PERMANOVAs were used to distinguish which water masses were different from each other. To test if bacteria and archaeal populations were both stratified by water mass, the OTU table was split to separate OTUs identified as bacteria into one OTU table and OTUs identified as Archaea into another. Weighted Unifrac distances were determined for each of these domain-specific OTU tables. NMDS analysis was performed using weighted Unifrac distances as described above. To determine if the Bacterial and Archaeal communities in the three water masses were different from each other, PERMANOVA analysis was performed using the Adonis function in the vegan package in R. Environmental variables were fit to the weighted Unifrac distance matrix in order to test which environmental variables explain the differences observed in the beta diversity analysis. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, depth, salinity, sulfate, silicate, nitrate, inorganic phosphate, NPOC, and total nitrogen were fit to the weighted Unifrac distance matrix using the envfit function in the vegan package in R. The significance of the variable fitting was determined using 999 permutations. Variables that fit the data with a p value of less than 0.05 were plotted. In order to test the hypothesis that microbial classes are differentially abundant between these water masses, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the relative abundance each taxonomic order in samples from different water masses. P values were corrected using False Discovery Rate correction. Tukey honest significant difference test was used as a post hoc test to identify in which water masses the taxa were differentially abundant. Taxonomic orders that had an ANOVA corrected p value of less than 0.05 were considered to be significantly different. To further identify microbial taxa that were indicative a particular water mass, Indicator species analysis was performed in R using the IndVal function in the labdsv package [60] . Indicator species analysis seeks to identify taxa that are present in the majority samples of one group and absent in the majority of samples from other groups. Indicator species analysis calculates an IndVal as described in Dufrene and Legendre [61] . IndVal is the product of the relative frequency and relative average abundance of a species or OTU in a cluster. The maximum IndVal of 100% is observed when an OTU is present in all sites of only one sample group. To test the significance of the IndVal, p values were calculated with 100 iterations, where in each iteration, the sample groupings were randomly assigned and an IndVal determined. These randomized IndVals were compared to the IndVal arrived at using the defined groupings to determine the likelihood of that IndVal being arrived at randomly. The p values for the IndVal calculation were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate correction.  The temperature profiles of the water column indicated a thermocline at approximately 50 m depth (Fig. 1B) . Below 400 m the water temperature became constant at 13.8°C. The salinity at these stations was between 38-39 psu. The dissolved oxygen remained high throughout the water column and decreased to about 70% of saturation at depth (Table 1) . Turbidity and pH were relatively constant throughout the water column with pH at 8.2 and turbidity around 1.5 FTU. Temperature and salinity plots of the water profiles indicated the presence of three water masses at these sampling sites (Fig. 1 C) . Water profiles of our sampling stations indicate that the salinity of the LIW is much higher than the AW and EMDW. Our data also show that the AW is characterized by low or below detection levels of inorganic nutrients, and high NPOC levels (mean 97.4 μM) ( Table 1 and S1  Table) . Inorganic nutrients concentrations increased in our samples throughout the LIW, whereas NPOC decreased with increasing depth (S2 Fig). Nutrient concentrations, NPOC, and salinity all remained fairly constant throughout the EMDW at these five sampling locations. PCA of environmental factors for the 20 water samples demonstrated that water samples from the same water mass cluster together on the PCA plot (Fig. 2) . These distinct groupings corresponded to the three water masses. PERMANOVA of Euclidian distances demonstrated that samples from the same water mass were significantly different from samples from the other water masses (P permutated = 0.001). Both AODC and PLFA biomass estimates indicate that the biomass was highest in the AW and gradually decreased with depth (Fig. 1D ). Cell counts estimated by PLFA analysis were almost an order of magnitude lower than the cell numbers determined by AODC. Despite these discrepancies, both methods demonstrate that the microbial abundance in the AW was higher than in the intermediate and deep-water masses. The mole percent of polyunsaturated lipids in our samples was significantly different between these three water masses (ANOVA P = 0.0004). Polyunsaturated lipids comprised 11.9 mole percent of the lipids in the AW, whereas they made up 2.7% and 1.9 mol% in the LIW and EMDW respectively (Table 2) . Mid-Branched saturates were also differentially abundant between these water masses (ANOVA P = 0.02). The abundance of mid branched saturates was highest in the LIW and is significantly different from the abundance in the AW (Tukey HSD P = 0.005). Microbial diversity is distinct for each water mass 1.7 million 16S rRNA reads were retained after quality filtering. The average number of reads per samples was 83,948 with the number of reads ranging from 13,753 to 160,639 (S3 Table) . The total number of OTUs present at a relative abundance of greater than 0.005% was 1,023. Diversity analysis using Shannon, Simpson, and Phylogenetic Diversity-whole tree metrics indicate that microbial diversity was lowest in the samples from the AW. The highest diversity was seen in samples from the LIW. Diversity then decreased in the EMDW (Fig. 3A and S3  Fig) . Alpha diversity was significantly different between water masses for each of the metrics tested as determined by ANOVA and Tukey HSD test (Table 3) . Both hierarchical clustering and NMDS analysis indicated that samples from the same water mass clustered together (Fig. 3 B and C ). There were significant differences in the microbial communities of each water masses as determined by PERMANOVA analysis (Bray Curtis-P permuted = 0.001, weighted Unifrac-P permuted = 0.001). Samples from AW clustered very closely together and were distant from samples derived from the deeper two water masses ( Fig. 3B and 3C ). PERMANOVA analysis indicates that the AW was significantly different from the LIW and EMDW (AW v. LIW-P permutated = 0.006, AW v. EMDW-P permutated = 0.001). PERMANOVA analysis comparing the LIW and EMDW showed that even though the differences between the LIW and EMDW were less pronounced, they were significant (P permutated = 0.012). NMDS plots constructed using OTU tables separated by domain revealed that both the Bacterial and Archaeal communities clustered by water mass. PERMANOVA analysis of the separated microbial communities indicate that there were significant distinctions in the bacterial and archaeal communities between the three water masses (Archaea-P permutated = 0.002; Bacteria-P permutated = 0.001) (S4 Fig.) . Environmental variables were fit to the NMDS plot to examine which physical and geochemical factors affect community structure (Fig. 3C) . Temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, silicate, nitrate, inorganic phosphate, NPOC, and total nitrogen all significantly fit the NMDS plot with p-values less than 0.05. The microbial community in the AW was strongly affected by NPOC and somewhat by temperature. Salinity partially dictates the distinction between the EMDW and LIW. Nutrient concentrations were the main factor structuring the community of the EMDW. Distinct microbial taxa were found in each water mass (Fig. 4) . ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests comparing the relative abundance of microbial classes across water masses revealed that 53 classes show significant differential abundance across the three water masses. Additionally, 37 indicator taxa were identified by indicator species analysis as good indicators of the water masses. The most abundant groups in the AW were Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The Cyanobacterial groups in the AW were comprised of both relatives of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Synechococcus were most abundant at the very top of the AW (10 m depth) and Procholorococcus dominated the remaining AW samples (50 to 60 m depth). The Proteobacteria in the AW were predominantly Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria. Furthermore, the dominant Bacteroidetes in the AW were primarily from the Flavobacteria class. The mean relative abundance of Flavobacteria in the AW is 11% of recovered reads, which was ten times greater than the average abundance of Flavobacteria in the LIW and EMDW. The abundance of Alphaproteobacteria was significantly different between the three water masses (ANOVA p-value 0.0001) with the highest relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in the AW. Indicator species analysis confirmed this, showing that Alphaproteobacteria, as well as Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes were all good indicators of the AW (Fig. 5) Fig 3.

Despite the differences in overall microbial community structure between the intermediate and deep-water masses (P permutated = 0.012), the most dominant taxa in the both water masses were Thaumarchaeota. Euryarchaeota were also a large portion of the recovered reads from the two deeper water masses (8-14% of recovered reads). These Euryarchaeota are from the Marine Group II and Marine Group III families. ANOVA with Tukey HSD test and Indicator Species analysis indicated that Deltaproteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Thaumarchaeota, and Archaea from the class Halobacteria were enriched in and good indicators of the LIW. The relative abundance of Deltaproteobacteria was significantly different between the three water masses (ANOVA corrected p-value 2.01E-08) and was higher in the LIW relative to the other two water masses. While, halophilic Archaea were a relatively low percentage of recovered reads in all samples, they are good indicators of the LIW (indicator value: 0.99, q-value: 0.019). Gammaproteobacteria related to Methylococcales and Oceanospirillales, as well as SAR406 and Nitrospirae are indicators of the EMDW, based on indicator species analysis. Gammaproteobacterial abundance was significantly different between the three water masses (ANOVA P = 1.43E-07). Gammaproteobacteria were present at higher abundance in the EMDW relative  The near-bottom sample from the North Alex Mud Volcano (Station 3) was quite distinct from other samples at similar depths. In particular the relative abundance of Flavobacteria, Methylococcales, and Thiotrichales was higher in this sample relative to other samples from similar depths. (Fig. 4 and S6 Fig.) . Flavobacteria were present at high relative abundances in the AW, but much lower abundances in the LIW and EMDW. In this mud volcano sample, Flavobacteria comprised 12% of recovered reads, which is almost ten times greater than any other deep-water sample. Thiotrichales were found at 4% of recovered reads in this samples compared to an average of 0.98% in the rest of the EMDW. Additionally relatives of Methylococcales were present at high abundance in this sample (22.7% of recovered reads). Methylococcales were only found at similar abundances in samples taken from much deeper depths.  The goal of this study was to identify the effect of physical and geological phenomena on structuring the microbial community in the Eastern Mediterranean water column. Our geochemical analysis demonstrated that the waters of these sites in the Eastern Mediterranean are highly stratified by depth. Chemical and physical stratification at our sampling stations separated according to the three previously described water masses [16] . Our results indicated that higher organic carbon and higher temperatures are characteristics of the AW, the LIW has elevated salinity, and the EMDW has higher nutrient concentrations. Our results also confirm previous reports, which state that phosphate concentrations are low throughout the water column [15, 62] . The distinct physical and chemical properties of these water masses afford distinct niches in which different microbial communities can establish themselves. Our results also demonstrated that microbial abundance differed by depth. The high cell numbers in the surface waters are in line with previous reports, which demonstrated a decrease in cell numbers with depth [25] . AODC cell counts were an order of magnitude higher than cell counts determined by PLFA analysis. This could be due to the fact that PLFA cell counts are derived from a conversion factor, which is often determined from cultured cells and is also based on bacterial cell size. Therefore, PLFA conversion factors do not always directly relate to cell counts [48] . Additionally, PLFA measurements do not take into account Archaeal lipids. Thaumarchaeota are often dominant microbes in deep marine waters [63] [64] [65] [66] . Therefore, PLFA biomass estimates from water with high numbers of Archaea, may underestimate microbial cell numbers. Analysis of PLFA biomarkers confirmed the presence of distinct microbial taxa in each water mass. We have demonstrated that the surface waters have a higher relative mole percent of polyunsaturated lipids. Polyunsaturated lipids are indicative of Cyanobacteria (18:2ω6) and Eukaryotes (polyunsaturates with an ω3 double bond) [67] . Our PLFA data suggests that active phototrophic microbes were present at much higher abundance in the surface waters compared to the deeper water masses. Our PLFA results also indicate an increase in mid-branched saturated PLFA in the LIW and EMDW. Mid-branched saturates are biomarkers for metal and sulfate reducing microbes [67] , many of which are from the Deltaproteobacterial class. The elevated levels of these PLFAs may indicate higher abundance of these microbial taxa in these deep-water masses. More detailed distinctions in the microbial community structure were observed when analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing data. We demonstrated that microbial diversity (Shannon, Simpson, and phylogenetic diversity) was significantly different between these water masses, with the diversity being highest in the LIW. The lowest diversity was observed in the AW with an increase in diversity in the LIW and a subsequent decrease in the EMDW. Nutrient concentrations gradually increased across the LIW. This gradient may provide a variety of niches capable of supporting diverse communities of microbes in the same water mass. Our results are in line with previous reports that have shown that the diversity of deep-water microbial communities is higher than surface and subsurface waters [11, 14] . Our findings also confirm previous studies, which have shown that microbial communities are distinct in different oceanic water masses [11, 12, 14] . It is not surprising that the microbial community in the photic zone was distinct from that in the aphotic zone, however there were significant and unexpected differences in the microbial community between the LIW and the EMDW. A recent study of the microbial community in the Southwest Atlantic indicated that there were very few differences between deep-water masses in the Southwest Atlantic [14] . However, we observed distinct differences between each of the three water masses in our samples from the Eastern Mediterranean. Cyanobacteria were most abundant in the AW, which has the highest light levels to support growth of phototrophic microbes. The majority of Cyanobacterial reads recovered from samples from the AW were related to Prochlorococcus species, which are well adapted for growth in nutrient poor surface waters. The stoichiometry required to support growth of Prochlorococcus is shifted from the Redfield ratio enabling growth in phosphorus-limited ecosystems such as the Eastern Mediterranean [68, 69] . In addition to Prochlorococcus, Alphaproteobacteria are significantly enriched in the AW. These Alphaproteobacteria are related to Rhodosprillales, Rhodobacteriales, and Rickettsiales, which are related to SAR-11-a ubiquitous bacterium in marine surface waters [70] . Both Prochlorococcus species and members of the Alphaproteobacteria are well adapted for growth in oligotrophic environments [71] . The nutrient concentrations in the AW are much lower than in other water masses and in many cases below detection. These low nutrient concentrations may select for these microbes, which are capable of thriving under nutrient limitation. Members of the Flavobacteria were also found at significantly higher levels in the AW relative to the deeper two water masses. Members of the Flavobacteria have been shown to be involved in degradation of high molecular weight organic matter [72] and could be involved in degrading the organic matter that is produced by phototrophic Cyanobacteria and algae in the AW. Thaumarchaeota related to cosmopolitan ammonia oxidizing Archaea [63] [64] [65] [66] were dominant members of the deep-water community representing between 18-40% of the recovered reads for samples from the LIW and EMDW. The fact that Thaumarchaeota dominated samples from the LIW and EMDW indicates that they perform an essential function in the intermediate and deep-water environments of the Eastern Mediterranean and may be important players in the nitrogen cycle of the Mediterranean deep-water. Elevated levels of Deltaproteobacteria were also a defining factor of the LIW. Many of these Deltaproteobacteria are closely related to SAR324, which are physiologically diverse group [73] . Some microbes in the SAR324 group have the ability to grow autotrophically and heterotrophically participating in carbon, sulfur and nitrogen cycling [73, 74] . Their presence at elevated levels in the LIW may indicate that some of these processes are occurring in this intermediate water mass. Some of the important taxa in the LIW are putatively involved in nitrogen cycling. For example, Nitrospinaceae, Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi from the SAR202 class are all important member of the microbial community in the LIW. Nitrospinaceae related to the autotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacterium, Nitrospina, are good indicators of the LIW (indicator value 0.82 qvalue 0.019). Members of the Planctomycetes are quite diverse in their ecology and functional capacity, with some Planctomycetes able to perform anaerobic ammonia oxidation (annamox), which is an essential process in the nitrogen cycle of many marine environments [75] , [76] . Chloroflexi from the SAR202 class were also found at high abundances in the LIW (10-15% of recovered reads). It has been proposed that Members of the SAR202 class are involved in amino acid mineralization [77] . These findings indicate that some of the microbes in the LIW are putatively involved in autotrophic and heterotrophic processes related to nitrogen cycling. The importance of nitrogen cycling in the Mediterranean deep-water was suggested by a recent study which showed that nitrogen fixation in the aphotic zone of the Eastern Mediterranean was quite high [24] . Our finding that the predominant taxa in the LIW were related to microbes involved in nitrogen cycling processes suggests that the LIW is an essential part of the nitrogen cycle of the Mediterranean Sea. We also found organisms that were indicative of the different water masses. Our results demonstrate that the LIW has the highest salinity of the three water masses in the Eastern Mediterranean. Correspondingly, we found halophilic Archaea from the class Halobacteria were good indicators of the LIW (indicator value 0.99, q value 0.019). This high indicator value suggests that Halobacteria were found in most of the samples from LIW and were absent in lower salinity samples from the AW and EMDW. The ability of Halobacteria to thrive under high salt conditions [78] may allow them to colonize the higher salinity LIW. Parvarchaeota were indicators of the EMDW. The Parvarchaeota are a poorly understood group in a newly described super phyla unified by their small cell size and small genome size [79, 80] . Their role in the EMDW microbial community is still unclear, and requires further investigation. Gammaproteobacteria from the Oceanospirillales and Methylococcales orders were present at high abundance in the EMDW microbial community. The most abundant Oceanospirillales in the EMDW were most closely related to the SUP05 and Halomonadaceae families. Relatives of SUP05 have been found as a part of sulfur oxidizing assemblages in different environments [81, 82] . There is metagenomic and physiological evidence that the SUP05 group is involved in autotrophic growth involving sulfur and hydrogen oxidation. Microbes related to SUP05 were indicators of the EMDW (indicator value of 0.99, q-value of 0.019) suggesting that sulfur and hydrogen oxidation may be occurring in the EMDW. Additionally, Sequences corresponding to Methylococcales comprised between 5-20% of the recovered reads in samples from the EMDW and were indicator species for the EMDW (Indicator value 0.99, q-value 0.019). Methylococcales are methanotrophs and typically acquire their carbon and energy from methane oxidation. The dominance of sequences related to known methanotrophs suggests that methane oxidation may be another important physiology in the deep waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. Many of the microbes in the deeper water masses are putatively involved in autotrophic physiologies. Therefore, it is possible that the oligotrophy of the Eastern Mediterranean has selected for a set of autotrophic microbes that use the available nutrients in energy generating processes. Another goal of this study was to characterize the effect of geological phenomena such as mud volcanism on the microbial community of the water column. Our results demonstrate that the microbial community directly above the North Alex Mud Volcano was distinct from the microbial community in other samples from similar depths. However, the microbial community in the upper water column (i.e. AW and LIW) above the North Alex Mud Volcano resembled the microbial community from samples collected within the same water masses in other sampling locations. Members of the Flavobacteriales, Thiotrichales and Methylococcales were present at higher abundances in this mud volcano sample as compared to samples from similar depths from other stations. Flavobacteria have been implicated in degradation of high molecular weight organic matter [72] . It may be that the mud volcano has enriched for microbes capable of utilizing the emitted organic material from the mud volcano. The Thiotrichales sequences in this sample are most similar to members of family Piscirickettsiaceae. PAH-degrading Cycloclasticus and halophilic methylotrophic Methylophaga species are members of the Piscirickettsiaceae. Methylococcales are present at much higher levels in this sample than in samples from similar depths. The elevated abundance of Thiotrichales and Methylococcales in this samples could be indicative of active release of methane and other hydrocarbon compounds into the water column above the North Alex Mud Volcano. The increased abundance of known hydrocarbon degraders as well as a distinct community structure directly above the mud volcano suggests that mud volcanism affects the microbial community in the overlaying waters. Further genomic work is required to better understand the role of these and Flavobacteria and other putative hydrocarbon degrading microbes in the deep-water community, especially in the water column adjacent to natural seeps. This study employed PLFA analysis and massively parallel 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine effect of water stratification and mud volcanism on the microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column. The adjacent water masses of the Mediterranean have selected for distinct microbial communities able to colonize these separate water masses. Our results contribute to the growing body of work, which demonstrates that physical factors in addition to geochemical parameters influence microbial community structure. Our results also clarify importance of the deep-water microbial communities of the Eastern Mediterranean in nitrogen cycling. In particular, the microbial community in the LIW contains a number of microbes putatively involved in nitrogen cycling and may be essential to the nitrogen cycle of the Eastern Mediterranean. Our study also demonstrated that geological phenomena such as mud volcanism drastically affect the microbial communities present in the water column by enriching for microbes known to utilize hydrocarbons and high molecular weight organic matter. These data combine to underscore the important role that physical, geological, and geochemical factors play in shaping marine microbial communities. Supporting Information Table. PLFA Data.

25312939,"Biogeochemical interactions among the arsenic, iron, humic substances, and microbes in mud volcanoes in southern Taiwan.","Fluid and mud samples collected from Hsiaokunshui (HKS), Wushanting (WST), Yenshuikeng (YSK), Kunshuiping (KSP), Liyushan (LYS), and Sinyangnyuhu (SYNH) mud volcanoes of southwestern Taiwan were characterized for major ions, humic substances (HS) and trace elements concentrations. The relationship between the release of arsenic (As) and activities of sulfate-reducing bacteria has been assessed to understand relevant geochemical processes in the mud volcanoes. Arsenic (0.02-0.06 mg/L) and humic substances (4.13 × 10(-4) to 1.64 × 10(-3) mM) in the fluids of mud volcanoes showed a positive correlation (r = 0.99, p < 0.05) except in Liyushan mud volcano. Arsenic and iron in mud sediments formed two separate groups i) high As, but low Fe in HKS, WST, and SYNH; and ii) low As, but high Fe in the YSK, KSP, and LYS mud volcanoes. The Eh(S.H.E.) values of the mud volcano liquids were characterized by mild to strongly reducing conditions. The HKS, SYNH, and WST mud volcanoes (near the Chishan Fault) belongs to strong reducing environment (-33 to -116 mV), whereas the LYS, YSK, and KSP mud volcanoes located near the coastal plain are under mild reducing environment (-11 to 172 mV). At low Eh values mud volcanoes, saturation index (SI) values of poorly crystalline phases such as amorphous ferric hydroxide indicate understaturation, whereas saturation is reached in relatively high Eh(S.H.E.) values mud volcanoes. Arsenic contents in sediments are low, presumably due to its release to fluids (As/Fe ratio in YSK, KSP, and LYS sediment: 4.86 × 10(-4)-6.20 × 10(-4)). At low Eh(S.H.E.) values (mild to strong reducing environment), arsenic may co-precipitate with sulfides as a consequence of sulfate reduction (As/Fe ratios in WST, HKS, and SYNH sediments: 0.42-0.69).",N/A,Chia-Chuan Liu,2011,21879854,10.1080/10934529.2011.598793
52112134,In situ development of a methanotrophic microbiome in deep-sea sediments,"Emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the seabed is globally controlled by marine aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs gaining energy via methane oxidation. However, the processes involved in the assembly and dynamics of methanotrophic populations in complex natural microbial communities remain unclear. Here we investigated the development of a methanotrophic microbiome following subsurface mud eruptions at Hakon Mosby mud volcano (1250 m water depth). Freshly erupted muds hosted deep-subsurface communities that were dominated by Bathyarchaeota, Atribacteria and Chloroflexi. Methanotrophy was initially limited to a thin surface layer of Methylococcales populations consuming methane aerobically. With increasing distance to the eruptive center, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterales and thiotrophic Beggiatoaceae developed, and their respective metabolic capabilities dominated the biogeochemical functions of the community. Microbial richness, evenness, and cell numbers of the entire microbial community increased up to tenfold within a few years downstream of the mud flow from the eruptive center. The increasing diversity was accompanied by an up to fourfold increase in sequence abundance of relevant metabolic genes of the anaerobic methanotrophic and thiotrophic guilds. The communities fundamentally changed in their structure and functions as reflected in the metagenome turnover with distance from the eruptive center, and this was reflected in the biogeochemical zonation across the mud volcano caldera. The observed functional succession provides a framework for the response time and recovery of complex methanotrophic communities after disturbances of the deep-sea bed.","The ocean seabed is the largest methane reservoir on Earth, comprising this climate-relevant gas in the form of semistable methane hydrates, as gas bubbles or dissolved in porewater. Globally, most of the methane rising from deeper subsurface layers is oxidized by methanotrophic microbial communities before it can reach the hydrosphere [1] . The methanotrophic communities in the seabed are diverse, but dominated by relatively few globally distributed types [2] . The thin oxic surface layer of methanerich sediments is often inhabited by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria of the Methylococcales [2] [3] [4] [5] . Anoxic subsurface layers, where methane and sulfate overlap, are inhabited by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and their partner bacteria of the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacterales [6] [7] [8] [9] . These methanotrophic communities, also referred to as the microbial methane filter, remove >90% of the methane in undisturbed continental margin sediments [1] . Methanotrophs also play an important role in methane removal at shallow [10, 11] and deep-sea gas-emitting seep habitats [12, 13] . Hence, only a small fraction of the seabed methane escapes from these sediments to the hydrosphere and atmosphere. However, the microbial methane filter at geologically highly dynamic seeps such as mud volcanoes has a lower efficiency, removing only 10−30% of the rising methane [14, 15] . Understanding the causes for these different efficiencies, as well as the time scales needed for the establishment of an efficient methane filter, is crucial in order to assess the consequences of natural and man-made seafloor disturbances, such as rapidly dissociating hydrates [16, 17] , mud slides, eruptive mud volcanoes [14] or large oil spills [18] [19] [20] . Here we study the development of a deep-sea microbiome disturbed by seafloor mixing due to gas eruptions and mud slides at the actively gas-emitting Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) on the Norwegian continental slope. Marine mud volcanoes are seabed structures formed by upward migration of subsurface gasses together with fluids and sediments, from hundreds of meters to several kilometers depth by buoyancy and gravitational forces [21] . They are an important source of the greenhouse gas methane, globally emitting an estimated 27 Tg per year [22] . It has been speculated that the reduced efficiency of the microbial methane filter at mud volcanoes could be due to the low availability of electron acceptors, since the sediments are purged with anoxic subsurface fluids rising with the gas [14, 23] . Other factors may be fluctuating temperatures, or frequent disturbances by mud mixing, which affect the growth of methanotrophs [24] . To investigate this further we compared the biogeochemistry and microbial community composition between recently disturbed, partially recovered, and undisturbed seafloor, using time-series observations and sampling of the Håkon Mosby in the framework of the deep-sea observatory ""LOOME-Long term observations of mud volcano eruptions"" (2003−2010) . The hypotheses tested were (1) that the subsurface microbial signature of freshly erupted muds disappears with exposure to deep oxygenated seawater, (2) that freshly erupted muds lack complex methanotrophic communities and hence may have a low capacity to remove methane, and (3) that it needs years to develop complex cold-seep communities due to the slow generation times and cold temperatures. We investigated the seabed microbial community in mud flows of the HMMV (72°N, 14°44′E, 1250 m water depth) during research campaigns in August 2009 and September 2010. In this period, the long-term geophysical recordings of the LOOME observatory ( Fig. 1, S1 ; [25] ) measured three major and 12 minor eruptions that occurred every 3−4 weeks. From this eruption pattern, detected by our deployed instruments and visual observations, we were able to infer an average mud flow velocity of 0.4 m day −1 across the HMMV center [25] . The mud velocity was used to convert sample distance to the eruptive central conduit into time. This space-for-time substitution approach used in ecological analyses of disturbances [26] allowed us to infer the spatiotemporal development of the methanotrophic microbiome. After visual seafloor inspection by ROV Quest and AUV Sentry, and biogeochemical sampling, we categorized the center muds into four zones (Figs. 1 and 2, S1; [27] ). Zone 1 covered an area of about 50 × 90 m at the HMMV center. It consisted of fresh subsurface muds that were deposited during several gas eruptions recorded in 2009−2010 (Fig. 1c, Fig. S2 ; [25] ). Zone 2 consisted of older subsurface mud flows southeast of the active center. The muds had a smooth, slightly rippled surface and were exposed to seafloor conditions for 1−2 years according to the morphology of the seabed and the measured flow velocity of the muds. Zone 3 were muds > 200 m away from the eruptive center, with thin thiotrophic mats, exposed to cold bottom waters already for 2−5 years. As a fourth zone we sampled the hummocky rim around the active center of HMMV. These sediments are stabilized by layers of hydrate at a few meters sediment depth [28] . They are not physically mixed by the center eruptions, as evident by comparative high-resolution mapping of the structure in 1996 [29, 30] , and by the dense coverage of long-lived siboglinid tubeworms ( Fig. S2F ), which were absent in zones 1-3. Biogeochemistry and microbial methanotrophic rates change with time and distance from the eruptive center The fresh warm subsurface muds exposed during eruptions were saturated with methane as indicated by spontaneous in situ degassing, and had high concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity and ammonium, indicative of a deep-subsurface origin of the pore fluid (Table 2 , Fig. 2b, c) . The fluids originate from a depth of up to 3 km below the seafloor, where the central conduit of HMMV is rooted [28, 31] . The methane carbon isotopic signature of the dissolved gas in the warm sediments is similar to that of the surrounding gas hydrates with around δ 13 C = −60‰ (PDB), indicating a mixed thermogenic/biogenic origin in the deep subsurface [32] . Due to holes and cracks from degassing of the center muds (Fig. S2A) , sulfate-containing bottom water percolated 5−10 cm into the seafloor. In the exposed surface muds 9 months after the main eruption, we measured methane oxidation (MOx-total aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation) rates of up to 80 nmol ml −1 day −1 . These are low rates for seep ecosystems [6] , especially when considering the high availability of methane and oxygen at the surface, or methane and sulfate in HMMV subsurface sediments. Sulfate reduction (SR) was not detectable, and the concave shape of the sulfate gradient ( Fig. 2b) is explained by the downward diffusion of sulfate against an upward flux of subsurface fluids [33] . In zone 2, which still showed ripples from the mud eruptions (Fig.  S2D ), MOx rates were higher than in zone 1, peaking at 100 nmol ml −1 day −1 at the surface (Fig. 2c) ; SR rates peaked in the top few centimeters, but still no free sulfide was detected in the porewaters. Zone 3 is characterized by mats of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (Figs. S1B, C, S2D, E). Here, the sulfate profile showed substantial consumption in the upper centimeters, and sulfide concentration reached almost 6 mmol l −1 (Fig. 2d ). Integrated SR rates of zone 3 sediments measured during six expeditions between 2001 and 2010 (Table 2) consistently showed the high rates that are typical for a well-established community of anaerobic methanotrophs (18 ± 4 mmol m −2 d −1 ; mean ± S.E.; n = 18; Table 2 ; [34] ). These rates are around 60-fold higher than average sulfate reduction rates of nonseep impacted shelf sediments [35] . Sulfide production peaked in surface sediments of zone 3 (1.19 ± 0.15 mmol l −l ; n = 110), whereas sulfide concentrations were low in zones 1 and 2 (Table 2) confirming that AOM was not established in fresh sediments. Porewater analyses as well as methane oxidation and sulfate reduction rate measurements performed on these six expeditions support the lateral zonation across the caldera. This zonation is in accordance with the geophysical model, in which centrally rising mud and gas are laterally transported and eventually sink in upon degassing [25] . Our biogeochemical results strongly suggest that over the period of at least one decade AOM continuously established in muds of the same distance to the eruptive center-i.e. muds of a similar age-despite a continuous mud flow. Subsurface communities get transported to surface sediments due to mud volcanism We analyzed archived subsurface samples from the prestudy phase in 2003 and additionally assessed the microbial community composition of ten surface (S) and five Table 2 and ref. [61] subsurface (D) sediment samples across the same zones sampled after the eruptions. The microbial communities in the warm (10−20°C) subsurface sediments (3.8−2.5 m below seafloor) of the HMMV caldera were characterized by a relatively low archaeal and bacterial alpha diversity, and showed a low community turnover, i.e. replacement of microbial taxa across zones (Figs. 3, 4, Fig. S3 ). These simple and homogeneous communities support the geophysical model of a uniform, warm subsurface mud layer filling the central chimney of HMMV [25, 28, 36] . Interestingly, the subsurface communities were most similar to the surface communities of zone 1 ( Fig. 3b, c ; Table S2 ), which is in accordance with the observed upward transport and deposition of the subsurface sediments by gas eruptions (Fig. S2A ). Subsurface and also surface sediments of Zone 1 contained typical heterotrophic deep biosphere clades, such as Bathyarchaeota (Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group), Chloroflexi and Atribacteria (candidate division JS1) [37, 38] as well as Peptococcaceae and methanogenic Methanosaeta (Fig. 4, Fig. S4 ). The latter four clades were suggested to form a syntrophic network, degrading proteins and fatty acids under methanogenic conditions [39] . Bathyarchaeota, which comprise organisms that also degrade detrital proteins [40] , greatly dominated the archaeal community in the freshly deposited muds (Fig. 4, S4 ). We detected many genes involved in fermentation and methanogenesis ( Fig. S4, S5A ) in the subsurface metagenomes, while genes for sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation or methane oxidation were absent or very rare. The subsurface communities in the central mud conduct of HMMV may be fueled by organic compounds transported with rising porewater fluids from the deep subsurface. The subsurface and surface community of zone 1 contained very few ANME-3 sequences (<1% relative sequence abundance), and few genes affiliated with Methylococcales, sulfatereducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) (Fig. S4 ), in accordance with the biogeochemical profiles of the freshly exposed muds (Fig. 2 , Table 2 ). By comparative sequence analysis, we tested if the subsurface clades deposited at the surface, such as Atribacteria [41] , would persist in the surface muds with increasing exposure and distance from the central mud conduit. The subsurface-derived clades decreased in relative sequence abundance with increasing distance to the center. In zone 3, these clades were barely detectable in the sediments. The subsurface microbial signature was replaced by that of typical seep communities within around 2 years. Only 3−7% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs; at 98% 16S rRNA gene V4-V6 sequence identity) were shared between subsurface and surface muds (Fig. 3 , Table S2 ) and even less (1% shared OTUs) with the reference site that was characterized by typical oligotrophic deep-sea sediment organisms, such as Xanthomonadales and Thaumarchaeota [42] . This diversity pattern was also confirmed based on the turnover of gene families in the community metagenomes (Fig. 5a ). Only 18−35% of the gene families found in the subsurface metagenome of zone 1 (sample 11) were found in the surface metagenomes, while 66 and 77% gene families were shared between sample 11 and the other two subsurface metagenomes (Table S6) . Similarly, the surface metagenomes shared between 52 and 79% gene families among each other (60 ± 9.8 %, mean ± SD, n = 6), but only 18−48 % with the subsurface metagenomes (33 ± 9.4%, mean ± SD, n = 12). This suggests that subsurface-derived genes, and hence subsurface community functions, were rapidly depleted in the surface muds. Subsurface microbes have longer generation times compared to surface bacteria [43] [44] [45] . In addition, they were likely repressed by the exposure to the seafloor conditions; i.e. cold temperatures of −1°C and high oxygen concentrations (>280 μM; [46] ), and were eventually overgrown by others. Using the mud flow velocities measured by LOOME observatory and space-by-time substitution, we investigated how the microbiome composition and metabolic capabilities of the surface communities would shift across the different zones with time, and if these changes were in accordance with the changes in biogeochemical rates ( Fig. 2 ; Table 2 ). The analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons confirmed that community structure was significantly different between the zones, as tested by ANOSIM (R Arch = 0.7, p Arch < 0.01; R Bac = 0.5, p Bac < 0.01, Fig. S3 ). Also, the communities were more similar between adjacent zones than between zones that were further apart, e.g. zone 1 shared more OTUs with zone 2 than with zone 3 (Table S2) . Total cell counts increased with distance to the active center (Figs. 3, 6a) . Relative cell abundances of key microbial clades involved in methanotrophy and sulfate reduction also changed between the zones (Fig. 6b) , increasing twofold from zone 1 to 2. Further, we observed a strong increase in microbial richness and evenness in zone 3 compared to surface sediments of zone 1 and 2 (Fig. 3) . Microbial diversity continued to increase in the zone 4 sample and peaked in the reference site. Around 85% of archaeal and bacterial OTUs of the freshly erupted muds of zone 1 were replaced within 1−2 years of exposure to surface conditions (Fig. 3 , Table S2 ). Yet, the communities of zones 1 and 2 still shared key organisms (e.g. Methylococcales and Desulfobacterales), especially those samples taken at a similar distance to the central conduit (e.g. Samples 3 and 5, Fig. 3 ). Zone 3 sediments reached total cell numbers of 3 × 10 9 cells ml , similar to the community density in the stable hummocky rim (zone 4). Zone 4 harbored the most complex microbial communities at HMMV, with the highest diversity and evenness (Fig. 3) . The overall community development observed at the level of 16S ribosomal RNA gene diversity and turnover was also confirmed by the diversity and turnover of metabolic gene families ( Fig. 5;  Figs. S4, S5 ). Rarefaction curves showed that the expected number of gene families was highest in the consolidated muds of zone 3 and the reference site ( Fig. 5d ) and generally lower in freshly exposed sediments and subsurface muds. Similarly, the total number of observed gene families was highest in the metagenome of surface sediment from the reference site and low in the sediments of the active center. At the same time the number of unique gene families that exclusively occurred in one metagenome was high in the active center and lowest in the reference site (Fig. 5a ). This indicates that with distance from the active center the surface sediments are becoming increasingly diverse, but also increasingly similar on the level of community functions. In zones 1 and 2, OTUs affiliated with aerobic methanotrophic Methylococcales were abundant in the top cm of surface sediments exposed to the oxygen-rich cold bottom waters, as shown by relative sequence and cell abundances (Figs. 4, 6 ) and a high number of 16S rRNA and pmoA gene sequences in the metagenome (Fig. S4, S5B ). The Methylococcales reached 5 × 10 8 cells ml −1 sediment (3.1 ± 1.9 × Fig. 3 Alpha and beta diversity, and total cell abundance across HMMV sediments. a Archaeal and bacterial diversity was determined using OTUs (Operational taxonomic units at 98% 16S rRNA V4-V6 gene sequence identity, corresponding to the recommended taxonomic threshold for microbial species [74] ). OTU data were used to assess observed richness, Inverse Simpson diversity, and Chao1 estimated richness. Note: The axes for archaeal and bacterial values differ by one order of magnitude. Total cell numbers were determined by Acridine Orange Direct Counts and were integrated over the top 10 cm sediment depth. Dashes denote missing data points. b Shift of microbial community structure in HMMV sediments as visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using relative sequence abundance of archaeal and bacterial OTUs. Color indicates the sample origin 10 8 cells ml −1 sediment, mean ± SD, n = 6; Table 2 ) already after a few months of exposure of the subsurface muds (Fig.  S6 ). This peak in cell abundance of aerobic methylotrophs in fresh muds was observed in previous expeditions [14, 15, 47] , suggesting that these organisms rapidly colonize fresh HMMV muds in general. In the thin sediment surface layer where oxygen is available, Methylococcales can respond faster to the high supply of methane, as their higher energy yield supports faster growth rates compared to those of anaerobic methanotrophs [48] [49] [50] [51] . Also, aerobic methylotrophs could relatively rapidly colonize freshly exposed gassy muds, as they can disperse with bottom waters [2, 52] . Assuming that representatives of this group would settle on the freshly deposited muds by sediment resuspension across the mud volcano, and applying a mud transport rate of 0.4 m per day between sediments of zones 1 and 2 as observed in this time period [25] , the aerobic methylotrophs could have achieved a net growth rate of  Cell counts and sequences showed that anaerobic methaneoxidizing archaea (ANME) and their sulfate-reducing partner bacteria were rare in the freshly exposed center sediments of zone 1 (Figs. 4, 6; Fig. S7 ). Free-living sulfate- reducing bacteria (SRB) increased tenfold in relative abundance from zone 1 to zone 2, the latter harboring 2.4 ± 1.5 × 10 8 SRB cells ml −1 sediment (Table 2) . Zone 3 had similar SRB counts as zone 2, but in addition harbored large numbers of ANME/SRB consortia (Fig. 6 , Table 2 ). The sulfide that was produced by these AOM consortia (Fig. 2d , Table 2 ) supported the growth and establishment of sulfuroxidizing bacteria (SOB), forming white mats covering zone 3 (Fig. S1, S2D , E). In comparison, the thiotrophs were rare in sequence abundance in sediments of zone 1. Their relative sequence abundance increased between zones 2 and 3, where an increasing amount of oxidative dsrAB genes were detected in the metagenomes (Figs. S4, S8 ). The archaeal community of zone 3 was dominated by a single ANME-3 OTU. This OTU had a relative sequence abundance of below 0.1% in freshly exposed subsurface muds of zone 1, 2−30% in zone 2 and comprised 63−88% of all archaeal sequences in zone 3, indicating a significant increase of the population with time and distance from the mud and gas conduit, but also suggesting a slow doubling time of 100−200 days. This estimated doubling time of ANME-3 in situ corresponds to a growth rate of 0.003 −0.006 day −1 which is in good agreement to the rates estimated by in vitro experiments with psychrophilic ANME-2 (0.003 day −1 ; [48] ). All populations of ANME, SRB and SOB (Figs. 4, 6 ) and their metagenomic signatures, especially the relative abundances of mcrA and dsrAB genes (Figs. S4, S5A, S8) showed the same pattern. They were rare in subsurface and freshly exposed muds, and became abundant in surface sediments with increasing distance from the center and thus exposure time of the muds. This demonstrates that slow-growing, and initially rare hydrocarbon-consuming microorganisms are able to out-compete others at cold seeps when the conditions are favorable and the time-scale permits [56, 57] . In the undisturbed zone 4, ANME-2a and ANME-3 archaea had similar relative sequence abundances (Fig. 4) , indicating that these consolidated sediments harbor niches for more were assessed with DAPI (white bars) and compared to bacterial cell abundance (probe: EUB338-I-III, gray bars). Replicate samples were available for zones 1−3 (zone 1: n = 3, zone 2/3: n = 2), shown as multiple bar pairs. b Relative cell abundances based on single-cell counts using CARD-FISH with specific probes for Bacteria (probe EUB338 I-III), Methylococcales (probe MTMC-701 and competitor probes), Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (probe DSS658), Archaea (probe Arch915), and ANME-3 (probe ANME3-1249 and helper probes). Bacteria that did not overlap with Methylococcales or DSS are denoted ""other Bacteria"". Archaea that did not overlap with ANME-3 are referred to as ""other Archaea"". ""Cells without probe signal"" were only stained by the nucleic acid stain DAPI and not by general archaeal or bacterial probes. Relative abundances were averaged over the top ten centimeters; all three layers are shown in Figure S7 . Note: The relative cell abundances for ANME-3, Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus and Methylococcales are underestimated as these clades formed cell aggregates that were not included in the single-cell counts. Probe details are given in Table S3 ; detailed values and cell counts are archived [61] ANME clades, as compared to the disturbed sediments of the caldera, which were highly dominated by ANME-3. In zone 4, very little methane reaches the surface sediment due to active methanotrophic communities at the roots of the tubeworms in~60 cm depth [47] , resulting in very low methane oxidation rates at the surface ( Table 2 ). The low temperature and stability of the sediments as well as the presence of hydrates below 0.5−1 m sediment depth may explain why the investigated surface sediment are of low activity and share 12% OTUs with surface sediment of the nonmethane reference site (Fig. 3, Fig. S3 ). Together, the observation of community succession on mud flows at HMMV match previous experiments with wood and whale falls showing that deep-sea methanogenic, methanotrophic and thiotrophic clades need years to develop functional communities on allochthonous surfaces and energy supplies [58] [59] [60] . Here we studied the development of a deep-sea methanotrophic microbiome on mud flows of a methane-emitting mud volcano in situ. We were able to sample the communities of freshly exposed subsurface muds, and compare them to their source community, as well as to increasingly developed seep and nonseep communities outside the caldera. Changes in biogeochemical rates with increasing distance to the eruptive center of the mud volcano were mirrored by changes in the corresponding metabolic genes and cell counts of the respective clades. At the level of the whole microbial metagenome, both 16S rRNA sequence turnover as well as the diversity of metabolic gene families showed a pattern of increasing complexity with increasing development of the methanotrophic assemblages, supporting a rich and diverse bacterial and archaeal community. We were able to confirm our initial hypothesis based on biogeochemical measurements that subsurface communities of bacteria and archaea are replaced by pioneering aerobic methanotrophs and later complex anaerobic methanotrophic and thiotrophic communities. Even when electron donors and acceptors are not limiting, the succession of benthic deep-sea bacterial and archaeal populations may need years, before the typically high diversity and evenness of deep-sea sediment communities is reached. Our findings indicate that loss of seafloor integrity-in this case by gas eruptions and mud mixing-and thereby the local decline of active and complex methanotrophic communities can explain the low efficiency of methane consumption that is globally observed at active mud volcanoes. Over several years, a seep microbiome can develop from initially rare populations to a complex community, in this case study evidenced by increasing cell and sequence numbers, and increasing diversity, of aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs and thiotrophs. The observed functional succession provides insights into the response time and recovery of complex microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the deep sea.  Surface sediment samples (0−10 cm) at HMMV are exposed to the cold Arctic bottom water, and generally have an ambient temperature of −1°C. They were recovered either by TV-guided Multicorer or by push cores using the remotely operated vehicle Quest (Marum, University Bremen) ( Table 1) . Subsurface sediments of all zones (>2 m below sea floor) were obtained by gravity corer. Their temperature at 4 m below the seafloor ranged from around 15°C in the center to around 3°C at the hummocky rim [36] . After recovery, sediments were immediately subsampled in a refrigerated container (0°C) and further processed for biogeochemical analyses or preserved at −20°C for later DNA analyses. Further details to the geographic locations, dates of sampling, and all contextual data are provided in the supporting information Table 1 and in the public archive for Earth and environmental data PAN-GAEA; see ref. [61] . Porewater and turnover rates were measured in surface sediment cores obtained in 2010 using methods described previously [62] . We show four profiles in detail (Fig. 2 , MUC-809, MUC-827, MUC-838, MUC-847), all other measurements from 2010 are included in Fig. S8 and the summary Table 2 and can be accessed from the data publisher PANGAEA; see ref. [61] . Biogeochemical parameters of sediments from 2003 and 2009 have been reported previously [14, 15] . The pore water was extracted with Rhizons in 1 cm resolution and immediately fixed in 5% zinc acetate (ZnAc) solution for sulfate, and sulfide analyses. The total sulfide concentrations (H 2 S + HS − + S 2− ) were determined using the diamine complexation method [63] . DIC and alkalinity were measured using the flow injection method (detector VWR scientific model 1054) [64] . Nutrients were determined with a Skalar Continuous-Flow Analyzer [65] . Sulfate reduction (SR) and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) were measured ex situ by the whole core injection method [66] as previously described [67, 68] . Refer to SI for details on biogeochemical analyses. All cores except the reference site were degassing methane after retrieval; hence we could not measure true in situ methane concentration in In situ development of a methanotrophic microbiome in deep-sea sediments Table 2 Porewater chemistry, cell counts, methane oxidation, and sulfate reduction rates sediment pore waters. It was previously estimated that the in situ concentrations of methane in the gassy HMMV center could reach 100 mM [23] . 16S rRNA gene V4-V6 amplicon pyrosequencing DNA extraction was done in duplicates using 1 g sediment each and a commercially available extraction kit (UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation Kit, MoBio, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA was pooled and the V4-V6 hypervariable regions of archaeal and bacterial SSU rRNA genes were amplified using degenerate primers. We assessed the quality, size and concentration of PCR products on a Perkin Elmer Caliper GX. Reads were demultiplexed and barcodes removed for submission. Sequence reads were submitted to a rigorous quality control procedure using mothur v30 [69] and a routine [2, 70] that included denoising of the flow grams [71] , single-linkage preclustering [72] and the removal of chimeras [73] . Sequences were clustered at 98% ribosomal RNA gene V4-V6 sequence identity-corresponding to the recommended taxonomic threshold for microbial species [74] -and were taxonomically assigned using the SILVA taxonomy (SSURef v119, 07-2014 [75] ). Further information about sequencing datasets and contextual data are available at PANGAEA [61] . Relative abundance of archaeal and bacterial OTUs (operational taxonomic units clustered at 98% sequence identity) is based on the original mothur output (Table S1 ). To calculate Inverse Simpson diversity indices and Chao1 Richness [76] the OTU abundance tables were rarefied to account for unequal sampling effort using 300 (Archaea) and 1000 (Bacteria) randomly chosen sequences without replacement using mothur. Bray−Curtis dissimilarities [77] between all samples were calculated and used for twodimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations with 20 random starts [78] . All analyses were carried out with the R statistical environment and the packages vegan [79] , labdsv [80] , as well as with custom R scripts (for details see SI). DNA extraction using 3 g sediment (pooled from 0 to 10 cm sediment depth) was performed manually as previously described [81] . DNA was sheared using a Covaris and libraries were constructed with the Nugen Ovation Ultralow Library protocol and were amplified for 10−11 cycles. The amplified product was visualized on an Agilent DNA1000 chip or Caliper HiSens Bioanalyzer assay. Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations based on these results and size selected using a Sage PippinPrep 2% cassette. The final library pool had an average insert size of 170 bp with~25−30 bp partial overlap between pairs of reads. It was quantified using a Kapa Biosystems qPCR library quantification kit, then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 in a 2 × 101 paired-end sequencing run using dedicated read indexing. The samples were demultiplexed with CASAVA 1.8.2. Details on the library output are given in Table S4 . Further information about sequencing datasets and contextual data are available at PANGAEA [61, 82] . Ribosomal and metabolic gene reconstruction from metagenomic data 16S rRNA and metabolic gene abundances as well as gene reconstructions were generated using a novel, modified version of the phyloFlash pipeline (https://github.com/ HRGV/phyloFlash) called funcFlash for metabolic genes. In brief, the generated reads were mapped with BBMap at minimal global nucleotide identity of 70% against curated nucleotide databases: The SILVA SSURef v119 database [75] , a published dsrAB gene database (http://www. microbial-ecology.net/db_download/dsr_v3.zip, [83] ) and two newly generated pmoA and mcrA gene databases that are publicly available at PANGAEA; see ref. [61] . The mapped read pairs were counted when at least one read had a positive mapping. Full-length (>70% of the target length) genes were assembled with SPAdes [84] or reconstructed with EMIRGE [85] . The mapping of reconstructed metabolic genes to curated databases using funcFlash can be used to distinguish, whether a gene of interest is affiliated with organisms performing the reductive or oxidative pathway. In our case this new analysis allowed us to distinguish between dsrAB genes from sulfate reducers and from sulfur oxidizers, as well as between mcrA genes from methanogens and from methanotrophs. We used metagenomic data from seven sites to investigate richness, abundance, and turnover of gene families across the different zones of HMMV. Each metagenome was filtered to remove low-quality and/or short reads. Raw reads were merged into paired reads with BBMerge [86] . To enable the comparison of gene diversity across sites, each metagenome was subsampled to 10 6 paired reads using the BBMap ""reformat"" tool. Subsampled reads were analyzed with humann2 [87] . Here, the reads were subjected to a translated nucleotide search against species-level clusters of nonredundant gene families of the UniRef50 database [88] using DIAMOND [89] . Gene abundances were normalized according to gene length, and then conjoined to obtain a gene × metagenome table, analogous to an OTU × sample table, with gene families as rows and metagenomes as columns. This matrix allowed us to investigate diversity using metabolic gene families (functions) rather than the commonly used ribosomal genes (taxonomy). The gene × metagenome table was subjected to multivariate analyses (data reduction, hypothesis testing, visualization) based on the R packages vegan, labdsv, UpSetR [90] and customized R scripts. Prior to the analyses we removed gene families with less than ten read hits cumulated across all metagenomes, to focus on abundant gene families and to minimize the influence of spurious hits. NMDS ordinations, calculated percentages of shared gene families and the UpsetR diagram are based on a presence/absence matrix. Diversity indices and rarefaction curves were calculated with a subsampling-based iterative approach using abundance information. Refer to SI for details. Nucleotide sequence accession and contextual data availability 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic data are publicly available under SRA Bioproject PRJNA248084 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA248084/). Gene sequences were archived under accession numbers KX581156-KX581194 (16S rRNA), KX581122-KX581155 (mcrA) and KX581195-KX581216 (pmoA). Comprehensive contextual data [61] are publicly available from the publisher for Earth and environmental data PANGAEA under (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/ PANGAEA.861266). Total numbers of single cells were determined using acridine orange direct counts according to the protocol published elsewhere [91] . CARD-FISH was performed as previously described [54] with the following modifications. 4−6 µl of 25-fold diluted sediment were used for filtration. Archaeal cell walls were permeabilized with 0.1 M HCl for 2 min to detect ANME-3 cells, or Proteinase K solution (15 µg ml −1 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 0.05 M EDTA (pH 8), 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl) for 2−4 min at room temperature for all other archaea. Bacterial cell walls were permeabilized with lysozyme solution (1000 kU/ml) for 60 min at 37°C. Cells were stained with DAPI (1 µg/ ml), embedded in mounting medium and counted in 40−60 independent microscopic fields using an Axiophot II epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cell numbers of dense aggregates were estimated semiquantitatively as previously described [47] . A complete list of oligonucleotide probes, helpers, and competitors used in this study is provided (Table S3) . A summary of the results from all 260 CARD-FISH experiments is publicly available at PANGAEA; see ref. [61] . ",S. Ruff,2018,30154496,10.1038/s41396-018-0263-1
215213250,Plant growth promoting capability and genetic diversity of bacteria isolated from mud volcano and lime cave of Andaman and Nicobar Islands,N/A,"Sustainable agriculture has evolved from three perspectives: system of production to achieve self-sufficiency in food, concept of stewardship and means of sustaining rural communities. The indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides not only causes pollution but also leads to uncalled losses of microbial diversity in the natural environment. In view of this, usage of bio based fertilizers and pesticides are one of the promising ways to enhance crop productivity and to manage the plant diseases. In this view, use of plant growth promoting bacteria has an important role in developing promising method for crop management (Sturz et al., 2000) . The PGPR mechanisms to promote plant growth are of diverse nature such as phosphorus solubilization, production of plant hormones (Bent et al., 2001; Reyes et al., 2002) and excretion of diverse compounds like antibiotics or proteolytic enzymes. Some plant-beneficial microorganisms are known to antagonize plant pathogens through competition for nutrients; parasitism by means of hydrolytic enzyme production; inhibition of the pathogens by anti-microbial compounds; induction of systemic resistance in host plants (Whipps, 2001; Compant et al., 2005) . Mud volcanoes are featured where mixed fluid-rich fine-grained sediments, associated with fragments of rocks or consolidated mud, are expelled at the earth's surface or on the seafloor (Staffini et al., 1993) . It was discovered that the immediate surroundings of these volcanoes are constituted of micro-organisms, of which 99% are still unidentified today. One of 1,100 mud volcanoes is located in the Island of Baratang, part of the Great Andaman archipelago, where there was a significant eruption event in 2003. In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, out of total geographical area of 8,249 sq. km land, only 9% land is used for vegetable cultivation. The wilt caused by bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacereaum, fungal pathogen Fusarium sp., damping off caused by Pythium sp., root rot by Rhizoctonia sp. and Macrophomina sp., collar rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii and anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum sp., were reported to cause severe damage to the vegetable crops in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. As a new inch in the search of agriculturally important microorganisms from various sources, here the microorganisms have isolated from Mud Volcano, one of the natural gift of the great Andaman archipelago. Though studies proving that the microorganisms isolated from the terrestrial mud volcano shows potentiality like hydrocarbon utilization and production of methane gas (Alain, 2006 ) the current study was carried out to find out their potential microbial source as plant growth promoters and effective biocontrol agent. Sampling regime and physic-chemical analysis Volcano samples were collected from the Island of Baratang, part of the great Andaman archipelago, Indian Ocean. The samples has been collected from the different points of mud volcano (12º07'46.5"" latitude; 092º47'31.2"" longitude) viz., point of the eruption (PM), end of the volcano (EM), dried part of the mud volcano (DM), outside of the mud volcano (OM) and the soil sample from Lime Cave (LC) (12º05'37.6"" latitude; 092º44'38.5"") were collected to obtain a representative composite sample. In subsamples pH, electrical conductivity, available nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous contents as described by Jacob Parnell (1996) and the results were shown in Table 1 . For isolation of bacteria, 1 g of each soil sample was suspended into 9 mL of sterile saline solution. Ten-fold of serial dilution was performed then 0.1 mL of aliquot was used for pour plating on nutrient agar plates (Anon, 1957) . The plates were maintained at 28 ± 2°C for 48 to 72 h, total colonies were enumerated and the colonies showing visible morphological differences were isolated. Counts were done after 24 h of incubation at 25°C and results were expressed as colony forming units (cfu) g -1 soil (on a dry-weight basis). A total of 52 bacterial isolates were isolated from five soil samples of mud volcano and lime cave soils were purified and maintained on 20% glycerol stock and nutrient agar slant for the further experiments and analysis. Each isolate was subjected to morphology, motility and 3% KOH solubilization test (Suslow et al., 1982) . Biochemical tests were also performed. Nitrate reduction ability of the organisms was determined as described by García de Salamone et al. (1996) . Oxidase activity was measured using the reactive discs from Himedia, India. Based on morphological and biochemical characterization 24 of 52 isolates were selected for PGPR and diversity analysis. Indole acetic acid production Inocula were transferred to tryptone broth was used to quantify auxin production. Sterilized tryptone broth was inoculated with the test culture and incubated at 30°C for 48 and 72 h with occasional shaking. The tubes were centrifuged at 15,500 g for 2 min and auxin production was measured as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) equivalents, as follows: Equal volume of culture supernatant was added with Salkowski reagent (12 g L -1 FeCl 3 + 7.9 MH 2 SO 4 ). The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min for color development. Color intensity was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm using a standard curve (Sarwar and Kremer, 1992) . Phosphate solubilization ability of isolates was assessed qualitatively using Pikovaskaya's agar medium (Pikovaskaya, 1948 ) containing tricalcium phosphate (5 g/L). Each bacterial culture was spot inoculated in the centre of a plate and incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 48 h. Clear/halo zone indicates the positive cultures. The halo zone was calculated by subtracting bacterial colony diameter from the total halo zone diameter (Freitas et al., 1997) . Each test was replicated three times Qualitative assay was done based on strains competition for iron on medium supplemented with ferric complex of chrome azurol S (CAS) as described by Schwyn and Neilands (1987) . The nutrient agar medium was supplemented with CAS 60.5 g in 50 mL, Iron III solution (1 mM Fecl 3 .H 2 0 and 10 mM Hcl in 10 mL) and HDTMA (72.9 mg in 40 mL). The isolates were spot inoculated on the plates and incubated for 48 h at 30°C. Development of yellow-orange halo zone around the culture was considered as positive for siderophore production. Screening for cyanide production HCN production by the isolates was examined as described by Bakker and Schipper (1957) . The isolates were 1272 Venkadesaperumal et al. streaked on plates containing King's B medium amended with glycine (4.4 g/L) and the lid of each Petri plate placed Whatman no.1 filter paper soaked in 0.5% picric acid in 2% sodium carbonate. The plates were then sealed with parafilm and incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 4 days. Change of color from yellow to orange and then to dark brown in the filter paper indicated as positive reaction and the absence as negative reaction. The phytopathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani (ITCC 6376), Pythium aphanidermatum (ITCC 5488) and Macrophomina sp. (ITCC 5519) were collected from the Indian Type Culture Collections Centre, IARI, New Delhi and Sclerotium (Athelia) rolfsii (MTCC 288) collected from Microbial Type Culture Collection, IMTECH, Chandigarh. The antagonistic ability of bacterial isolates was determined by dual culture technique as described by Dennis and Webster (1971) . Six millimeter agar discs containing grown mycelia of any of the four phytopathogenic fungi were at approximate distance apart on a PDA dish. Four bacterial isolates were streaked between the agar discs. Inhibition of fungal mycelium around the bacterial colony was scored for 2-3 days by measuring the radial growth of the pathogen. PDA plate inoculated only with pathogen was taken as control. All strains were tested in two replicates on different plates and the tests were carried out twice for each isolate. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by the following formula where, I is percent inhibition of growth, C is mycelial growth in control plate, T is mycelial growth in test plate.  The fresh culture was spot inoculated on the pre poured Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) medium. The plate was incubated for 2-3 days at 28 ± 2°C. Plates were then flooded with Gram's iodine to visualize halo zone around the bacterial colony, which indicates positive result in utilizing of the cellulose substrate. Proteolytic activities of the cultures were screened qualitatively in a medium containing skim milk. Fresh culture was streaked onto the medium and incubated at room temperature for 24-48 h. Clear zone formation around the colony indicates the proteolytic activity of the bacterium as positive and absence as negative. Bacterial isolates were screened for their sensitivity or resistance to antibiotics. IAR has also been used in the genotypic identification of bacterial species. Plate of Muller Hinton Agar was swabbed with fresh culture; fourteen different antibiotic discs were pressed gently on the surface of the plate at sufficient distance and incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 3 days. The presence of inhibition zones around the discs of the different antibiotics were noted (Bauer et al., 1966) . Each test was replicated three times. A plates containing beef extract, peptone plus sodium chloride at different concentration (7-12%) was inoculated with 20 mL aliquot of an overnight test culture. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 24-48 h. Growth on the culture media plates is recorded as positive and absence of growth is recorded as a negative. The selected bacterial strains exhibiting pronounced in vitro PGP qualities were characterized for their diversity analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted based on the method described by Chen and Kuo (1993) . DNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose, ethidium bromide gel. One hundred nanograms of DNA were used as template in PCR procedures. Selected primers pA and pH (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' and 5'-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3' respectively) were used for amplification as described by Edwards et al. (1989) . The mixture was subjected to initial denaturation of 92°C for 2 min and 10 s followed by 35 cycles of 92°C for 1 min, 48°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min and 10 s and a final extension step of 72°C for 6 min and 10 s using GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR products were resolved using a 1.5% agarose gel photographed under UV transillumination. PCR products of 1.5 kb were sent to commercial gene se- (Table 2) Amplicons obtained using the primers pA and pH have been used for the restriction analysis using HpaII, and MspI resstrictases. The restriction mixture contained 10 mL of PCR product, 1.5 U of each of the restrictases and manufacturer's recommended buffer (2.5 mL of 10x) up to 25 mL volume. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h and the reaction was inactivated by heating at 70°C for 10 min. Restriction products were separated in 3% agarose gel in TAE buffer. Medium size 100 bp DNA (GeNeI) ladder were used to estimate the size of the digested fragments. Strains were genotypically characterized by BOX-PCR, as described by Rademaker and De Bruijn (1997) using BOX A1R (5'-CTA CGG CAA GGC GAC GCT GAC G-3') as primer. Reaction was performed in 50 mL reaction mixture containing: 5 mL buffer (10x), 1 mL of BOX A1R, 1.5 mL of each dNTP, 1 mL of Taq DNA polymerase, 36.5 mL of sterile bidistilled water and 4 mL of template DNA. PCR-amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the temperature profile was as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 6 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 53°C for 1 min, and extension at 65°C for 8 min followed by final extension at 65°C for 16 min. Amplified products were separated by horizontal electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Tomato and chili seeds were treated with bacterial suspensions of OM5 and EM9 strains (10 8 cfu/mL) as well as their combination (OM5+EM9 in equal parts) for 30 min and were shade dried at 28°C for 1 h, the control seeds were coated with sterilized tap water. The treated seeds were sown in pots (15-20 cm) sterilized with 0.7% sodium hypochlorite solution, filled with red sand, soil and farmyard manure (2:1:1) which was sterilized at 121°C for 30 min. Observations were recorded on germination percentage in the beginning, after one month of sowing, 10 seedlings from each replication were assessed for their root length, shoot length, wet weight and dry weight. Each treatment consisted of four replicates of 100 seeds each (25 seeds/pot) and the experiment was repeated three times. For the analysis of ARDRA and BOX PCR molecular weight and Rf values of each band was determined by using 'Molecular Analyst software' (Version 1.5). The character state '1' was given for a band, which could be clearly and reproducibility detected in the gel and '0' was assigned if it was not possible to determine. The similarity coefficient and cluster analysis was performed (Janda, 1991) by the unweighted-pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) of NTSYS-pc 2.02e (Applied Biosciences, Inc., New York, USA).  The characterized mud volcano and lime cave isolates (a total of 52 bacterial isolates) showed diverse morphological and cultural characteristics as indicated from variations in colony size and shape. On the basis of their Gram reaction, 10 (19.2%) of the isolates were found to be Gram positive and about 42 (80.8%) were Gram negative bacteria (Data not shown). Upon subjecting to various biochemical tests, it was observed that 34 isolates (65.4%) were able to degrade tryptophan to indole and pyruvic acid while other isolates showed negative reaction to indole test. Nearly 48.1% (25 isolates) of 52 isolates showed positive result for methyl red test, 27 isolates were shown to produce variable results and negative result for methyl red test. Twenty five isolates showed positive result to Voges Prauskauer test and nearly 51.9% isolates (27 isolates) showed variable and negative result to this test. Twenty three isolates utilized citrate and all the other isolates showed negative result for citrate utilization test. Only 30.8% isolates (16 isolates) were able to reduce nitrate to nitrite, while the rest of the isolates are non-reducers of nitrate. Starch hydrolysis results showed that 26 isolates (50%) were able to hydrolysis starch as a source of carbon and remaining isolates did not hydrolyze the starch. (Data not shown) Based on morphological and biochemical variations 24 distinct isolates were screened for their PGPR potential. Of the 24 isolates 15 were able to produce IAA. The outer part of the mud volcano sample had the more number of IAA producers in relation to other sites. Only 15 out of the 24 isolates were able to solubilize phosphate. The mud volcano sample collected from the outer part showed the highest number of phosphate solubilizer strains in relation to the other sites. Only 7 isolates of 24 were able to produce siderophores. The outer part of the mud volcano sample presented the highest number of isolates that produce siderophores. Of the 24 isolates 5 were able to produce HCN. Dried part of the mud volcano sample had the highest number of hydrogen cyanide production than other sites. Out of 24, 10 isolate showed protease and cellulose production (Table 3) . Isolates OM5, DM5, DM6, EM9, LC6 showed positive result for more than four properties tested. There was no significant contribution of the area from where the samples collected, as demonstrated in Table 3 . When susceptibility to antibiotics was investigated, isolates LC5, EM10 and EM3 showed sensitive to all antibiotics tested, none of the isolates showed resistant to all antibiotics. All OM isolates showed resistant to Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Amoxicillin. Whereas, DM isolates were resistant to Amoxycillin and Vancomycin and PM isolates showed resistant to Vancomycin. Isolates OM5 and EM4 tolerated high salt concentration of 12% (Data not shown). Isolates OM5, EM9 and LC6 showed antagonistic effects against mycelial growth of root rot fungus S. rolfsii (Inhibition zone greater that 40%). Isolates LC6 (67.2%) and EM9 (65.38%) are the only two bacterial isolate which inhibited P. aphanidermatum significantly over the control. Mycelial growth of R. solani was inhibited by strains DM5 (65%), EM9 (60%) and LC6 (57.2%). The antagonistic effect appeared after 3 days of incubation. Among 24 isolates EM9, OM8, OM5, OM11 and DM5 showed statistically significant highest mycelial inhibition of charcoal rot causing fungus Macrophomina sp. (Inhibition zone greater that 50%) (Table 4) . Undigested PCR products amplified with pA and pH primers produced a single band of about 1500 bp. ARDRA analysis revealed large variations among the isolates. Restriction pattern obtained after digestion of the amplified fragment with HpaII and MspI revealed 12 and 15 patterns respectively (Fig. 1a, b, c & d) . Similarity analysis was then performed based on composite ARDRA profile, showed low similarity index around 58% (Figure 2) . Amplified patterns were observed in the band profiles obtained during genetic analysis. Consequently, we suppose that the PGPR and antagonistic effects would not be associated to a single genotype of wide distribution, but to a pronounced bacterial genetic diversity. Four groups were formed in the composite dendrogram analysis. Group I consists of isolates from dried and end point mud volcano, group II formed with four isolates each from end point and dried mud volcano and two iso- lates from outside mud volcano. Group III comprised of predominantly outside mud volcano isolates followed by 2 isolates from lime cave and one isolate from point mud volcano. Group IV formed with two isolates of lime cave only. There is no grouping of correlation was observed among the isolates based on their respective antagonism and PGP properties. BOX sequences are regulatory sequences which can increase and decrease the specific gene expression (Lupski and Weinstock, 1992) . Amplicons obtained by BOX-PCR were analysed on 3% agarose gel (Figure 3a,b) . Strains were grouped into four clusters with low similarity index (Figure 4 ). All the strains showed wide variations in fingerprinting pattern due to their high degree of genetic variability and distributed into different clusters. Green house experiment analysis showed that there was an average increase of 14.2 and 27.4% in seedling emergence of chili and tomato respectively. Seed bacterization of chili and tomato have increased the secondary root numbers up to 56.8 and 46.5% respectively, significant increase in primary root length of both the plants were also noticed. Stem length of chili and tomato were also increased up to 10.5 and 38.1%. No significant difference 1276 Venkadesaperumal et al. 10, 9, 11, 10, 11, PM9, LC1, [4] [5] [6] . c&d Restriction Digestion pattern using enzyme HpaII. 10, 9, 11, 10, 11, PM9, LC1, [4] [5] [6] . 10, 9, 11, 10, 11, PM9, LC1, [4] [5] [6] . were noticed in fresh weight and dry weight of tomato plant but it was interesting to note that fresh and dry weight of chili plant was increased up to 91.2 and 135% respectively. Among all the different treatments, consortium of OM5 and EM9 showed best results in all parameters except fresh and dry weight of tomato (Table 5 and Figure 5 ). Present study is first to report the plant growth beneficial microorganisms in the active mud volcano and lime cave soil. As reported by several authors (Gilbert et al., 1993) that Gram negative ones are the most abundant rhizobacteria, around 80% of our isolates were Gram negative. Twenty four isolates were screened based on morphological and biochemical features. These isolates were screened for their potential PGPR characteristic. These twenty four isolates do not represent the bacterial diversity of the soil. Plant auxin IAA produced by the bacteria enhances plant cell elongation or cell division thus stimulates better root growth (Glick et al., 1998) . It was interesting to note that about 66% of our isolates are IAA producers. Under field conditions precipitated phosphates should be solubilized to readily available ones for plant growth, which can be done by plant growth promoting bacteria (Verma, 2001) . Siderophore produced by bacteria binds to the free iron in the rhizosphere, thus favors the biocontrol agent than those of the pathogen (Siddiqui, 2005) . Of the 24 isolates 7 were able to produce siderophores. Siderophores produced by the isolates should be studied for their affinity towards different iron complexes. Isolate DM5 showed positive response to all properties tested. Isolate EM9 showed positive response to all the above properties tested except cellulase production, isolate OM5 showed positive response to all the above properties tested except IAA and cellulase production. The above tested properties have been reported among the mechanisms by which the microorganisms promote plat growth (Niranjan et al., 2005) , supporting the further evaluation of our isolates for their potentiality. One of the mechanisms of fungal inhibition is degrading their cell wall by lytic enzymes, hence the isolates were also screened for their protease and cellulase production. Ten isolates of 24 showed positive result for both the enzymes production. Growth and yield of several crop plants has been adversely affected by salinity, interaction of plant growth promoting bacteria helps the survival in adverse conditions. All 24 isolates showed positive result of which OM5 and EM4 showed highest tolerant rate. Wide variety of bacterial species can be used to protect plants against fungal and bacterial diseases (Ren et al., 2006) . Our isolates were tested against phytopathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, Macrophomina sp. and Sclerotium (Athelia) rolfsii to assess whether they can act as effective biocontrol agent. Isolates OM5 and EM9 showed comparatively effective antagonism against all pathogens tested and can be considered for good candidature as biocontrol agent. Observations indicated that bacteria use to compete with pathogens for the nutrients available in the culture media and also some diffusible compound secreted by the bacterial strains should be responsible for fungal inhibiton. Eventhough Pantoea agglomerans is considered as bacterial pathogen for rice, studies proved the ability of these strains to reduce incidence of fire blight in apple, pears and flowers (Elmer et al., 2005) . It was also proved as most promising biocontrol agents for variety of bacterial and fungal diseases in plants (Rezzonico et al., 2009 ). A similarity analysis was then performed based on composite ARDRA profile from the use of the two restriction endonucleases (HpaII and MspI) showed low similarity index around 58%. In the genomic finger prints of potential isolates showed no particular correlation between the origin of the isolates and the ARDRA groups could be established. In BOX-PCR four groups were formed. There was a broad range of variations in their fingerprinting pattern due to their high degree of genetic variability and distributed into different clusters. On observation of these results, current study identified a high degree of genetic variability among different species as well as same species. In last few decades there is increased need to explore varied ecological niches to find out beneficial microorganisms. Increasing awareness about the chemically synthesized fertilizers based agriculture practices, this study identified two isolates selected and genetically characterized (Pantoea agglomerans [OM5], Exiguobacterium sp. [EM9]) showed excellent antagonistic property as well as other plant growth promoting properties. Field trail experiments showed increase in the plant growth of tomato and chili by seed bacterization. Hence these isolates can be of good candidate for potential agricultural use as multipurpose organism, effective biocontrol agent and plant growth promoters. ",Gopu Venkadesaperumal,2014,25763031,N/A
205982792,Substantial13C/12C and D/H fractionation during anaerobic oxidation of methane by marine consortia enrichedin vitro,"The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) by methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria is the major sink of methane formed in marine sediments. The study of AOM as well as of methanogenesis in different habitats is essentially connected with the in situ analysis of stable isotope ((13) C/(12) C, D/H) signatures (δ-values). For their kinetic interpretation, experimental (cultivation-based) isotope fractionation factors (α-values) are richly available in the case of methanogenesis, but are scarce in the case of AOM. Here we used batch enrichment cultures with high AOM activity and without background methanogenesis from detrital remnants to determine (13) C/(12) C and D/H fractionation factors. The enrichment cultures which originated from three marine habitats (Hydrate Ridge, NE Pacific; Amon Mud Volcano, Mediterranean Sea; NW shelf, Black Sea) were dominated by archaeal phylotypes of anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME-2 clade). Isotope fractionation factors calculated from the isotope signatures as a function of the residual proportion of methane were 1.012-1.039 for (13) CH4 /(12) CH4 and 1.109-1.315 for CDH3 /CH4 . The present values from in vitro experiments were significantly higher than values previously estimated from isotope signature distributions in marine sediment porewater, in agreement with the overlap of other processes with AOM in the natural habitat.",N/A,Thomas Holler,2009,23765889,10.1111/j.1758-2229.2009.00074.x
13303128,A molecular gut content study of Themisto abyssorum (Amphipoda) from Arctic hydrothermal vent and cold seep systems,"The use of DNA as a marker for prey inside the gut of predators has been instrumental in further understanding of known and unknown interactions. Molecular approaches are in particular useful in unavailable environments like the deep sea. Trophic interactions in the deep sea are difficult to observe in situ, correct deep-sea experimental laboratory conditions are difficult to obtain, animals rarely survive the sampling, or the study organisms feed during the sampling due to long hauls. Preliminary studies of vent and seep systems in the Nordic Seas have identified the temperate-cold-water pelagic amphipod Themisto abyssorum as a potentially important predator in these chemosynthetic habitats. However, the prey of this deep-sea predator is poorly known, and we applied denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to investigate the predator–prey interactions of T. abyssorum in deep-water vent and seep systems. Two deep-water hydrothermally active localities (The Jan Mayen and Loki's Castle vent fields) and one cold seep locality (The Hakon Mosby mud volcano) in the Nordic Seas were sampled, genomic DNA of the stomachs of T. abyssorum was extracted, and 18S rDNA gene was amplified and used to map the stomach content. We found a wide range of organisms including micro-eukaryotes, metazoans and detritus. Themisto abyssorum specimens from Loki's Castle had the highest diversity of prey. The wide range of prey items found suggests that T. abyssorum might be involved in more than one trophic level and should be regarded as an omnivore and not a strict carnivore as have previously been suggested.",N/A,Bernt Olsen,2014,24172025,10.1111/mec.12511
34712783,"A novel, mat-forming Thiomargarita population associated with a sulfidic fluid flow from a deep-sea mud volcano","A mat-forming population of the giant sulfur bacterium Thiomargarita was discovered at the flank of the mud volcano Amon on the Nile Deep Sea Fan in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. All cells were of a spherical and vacuolated phenotype and internally stored globules of elemental sulfur. With a diameter of 24–65 µm, Thiomargarita cells from the Eastern Mediterranean were substantially smaller than cells of previously described populations. A 16S rRNA gene fragment was amplified and could be assigned to the Thiomargarita-resembling cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization. This sequence is monophyletic with published Thiomargarita sequences but sequence similarities are only about 94%, indicating a distinct diversification. In the investigated habitat, highly dynamic conditions favour Thiomargarita species over other sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. In contrast to Thiomargarita namibiensis populations, which rely on periodic resuspension from sulfidic sediment into the oxygenated water column, Thiomargarita cells at the Amon mud volcano seem to remain stationary at the sediment surface while environmental conditions change around them due to periodic brine flow.",N/A,Anne-Christin Girnth,2011,20946529,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02353.x
21490211,Atribacteria from the Subseafloor Sedimentary Biosphere Disperse to the Hydrosphere through Submarine Mud Volcanoes,"Submarine mud volcanoes (SMVs) are formed by muddy sediments and breccias extruded to the seafloor from a source in the deep subseafloor and are characterized by the discharge of methane and other hydrocarbon gases and deep-sourced fluids into the overlying seawater. Although SMVs act as a natural pipeline connecting the Earth’s surface and subsurface biospheres, the dispersal of deep-biosphere microorganisms and their ecological roles remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the microbial communities in sediment and overlying seawater at two SMVs located on the Ryukyu Trench off Tanegashima Island, southern Japan. The microbial communities in mud-volcano sediments were generally distinct from those in the overlying seawaters and in the well-stratified Pacific margin sediments collected at the Peru Margin, the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank off Oregon, and offshore of Shimokita Peninsula, northeastern Japan. Nevertheless, in-depth analysis of different taxonomic groups at the sub-species level revealed that the taxon affiliated with Atribacteria, heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria that typically occur in organic-rich anoxic subseafloor sediments, were commonly found not only in SMV sediments but also in the overlying seawater. We designed a new oligonucleotide probe for detecting Atribacteria using the catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). CARD-FISH, digital PCR and sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes consistently showed that Atribacteria are abundant in the methane plumes of the two SMVs (0.58 and 1.5 × 104 cells/mL, respectively) but not in surrounding waters, suggesting that microbial cells in subseafloor sediments are dispersed as “deep-biosphere seeds” into the ocean. These findings may have important implications for the microbial transmigration between the deep subseafloor biosphere and the hydrosphere.","The subseafloor environment is one of the largest biospheres on Earth, with an estimated total abundance of microorganisms of about 2.9 × 10 29 cells, which is equivalent to half of the microbial cells worldwide in the oceans . Over the past decade, subseafloor life and the deep biosphere have been intensively explored by means of scientific ocean drilling, which has assessed the biosphere extent down to around 2.5 km below the ocean floor (Orcutt et al., 2013; Ciobanu et al., 2014; Inagaki et al., 2015) . Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that some subseafloor microbial cells are not dead but rather are physiologically active or revivable to some degree, and their long-term metabolic activity may contribute to global biogeochemical cycles (Morono et al., 2011; Røy et al., 2012; Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013) . The taxonomic composition of microbial communities in subseafloor sedimentary habitats has been extensively studied using a variety of cultivation-dependent and -independent molecular approaches, demonstrating that some predominant microbial taxa, distinct from known water-column communities, widely inhabit sediments at a variety of oceanic locations under similar geochemical and geophysical settings (e.g., Inagaki et al., 2003 Inagaki et al., , 2006 Webster et al., 2004; Biddle et al., 2008) . One of the common predominant microbial taxa frequently found in the marine sediment is Atribacteria including members of JS1 and OP9 which are recently revealed to be monophyletic by phylogenomic analyses of single-cell amplified genome (Nobu et al., 2016) . Atribacteria are especially predominant in anaerobic, organic carbon replete, and methane-rich marine sediment. Although representatives of this phylum have not been cultivated as yet, several recent studies of single-cell amplified genomes consistently suggested anaerobic heterotrophic metabolism (Carr et al., 2015; Nobu et al., 2016) . Although the co-occurrence of Atribacteira with methane (Inagaki et al., 2006) , no evidence has been reported that this phylum was directly involved in methane production or consumption. Alternatively, Atribacteira would control methane production in anaerobic marine sediment by primary or secondary fermentation producing fermentation products as acetate or CO 2 , that can be used as substrates for methanogen (Carr et al., 2015; Nobu et al., 2016) . Among diverse geological and oceanographic settings in the ocean, numerous submarine mud volcanoes (SMVs) have been observed worldwide along the margins of convergent plates, which transport mud, gasses and fluids from several kilometers below the seafloor to the overlying hydrosphere (Milkov, 2000; Kopf, 2002 and references therein) . SMVs accordingly serve as conduits for the release of substantial amounts of methane and other hydrocarbons into the water column (Sauter et al., 2006; Wallmann et al., 2006; Sahling et al., 2009) , and hence act as natural pipelines in the geosphere. Over the past decades, the microbial communities inhabiting hydrocarbon seeps associated with SMVs have been investigated around the world, including at the Håkon Mosby (Niemann et al., 2006; Jerosch et al., 2007; Losekann et al., 2007) , Kazan (Kormas et al., 2008; Pachiadaki et al., 2010) , Amsterdam (Pachiadaki et al., 2011) , Chefren (Omoregie et al., 2008) , and Gulf of Mexico mud volcanoes (Martinez et al., 2006) and at the Nankai Trough (Miyazaki et al., 2009) . The studies at SMVs mainly focused on the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) consortia of sulfate-reducing bacteria and methane-oxidizing archaea living in sediments at the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). Considering that SMVs transport not only solid materials (e.g., muds and breccias) but also gasses and fluids from deep sources (Sauter et al., 2006; Feseker et al., 2008) , it is possible that submarine mud volcanism may also transport microbial communities from the deep subseafloor biosphere to the overlying ocean. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents on the ridge systems have been proposed as ""windows to a subsurface biosphere"" (Deming and Baross, 1993) , and there have been some investigations into the dispersal of subseafloor microbial communities, including mesophilic to hyperthermophilic microbes, through volcanic and hydrothermal vent activity (e.g., Huber et al., 2003 Huber et al., , 2006 Takai et al., 2004; Jungbluth et al., 2016) . In the hydrothermal systems, however, only surface of vents are habitable zone for microbes due to the very steep temperature gradient up to higher than 300 • C. Therefore, deep-sea hydrothermal vents would not be considered as conduits of deep biosphare and hence the geosphere-biosphere interactions at sedimentary geosystems (e.g., oceanic plate subduction zones, forearc sedimentary basins) as well as interactions between the Earth's surface and deep subseafloor biospheres in the large oceanic province remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated microbial communities inhabiting two SMVs off Tanegashima Island, Japan (Ujiie, 2000) , by taking sediment cores from the summit (down to a sediment depth of 3.6 m) and samples of overlying seawater (up to 200-300 m above the summit). Sediment core samples were collected in 2015 using a Navigable Sampling System (see Ashi et al., 2014) , which enables pinpoint piston coring with televisionmonitoring of the seafloor. The concentrations of methane in the water column peaked at 19 and 72 m above the two SMVs, respectively, indicating the presence of a methane plume from the SMV. To identify and quantify members of the microbial communities in mud volcano sediment and seawater samples, we applied molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes using a second generation sequencer, image-based cell counts, catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), and microfluidic digital PCR techniques.  Previous acoustic seafloor surveys identified several 10s of SMVs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean at water depths of 1200-3500 m off Tanegashima Island, Japan. For one of these, geochemical information, including stable isotopic compositions of methane and water (i.e., interstitial water in sediment) is available (Nakayama et al., 2010) , whereas there are as yet no microbiological studies. In 2015, we investigated the distribution and diversity of microbial communities inhabiting two of the SMVs in this area: MV#1 and MV#14 (Figure 1 ). MV#1 has a diameter of about 3000 m, a height of 300 m, and is situated  Sediment and seawater samples were obtained at two stations, VTF2 (MV#1) and VTF5 (MV#14), during cruise KH-15-2 of R/V Hakuho Maru in 2015. Sediment samples were collected using the Navigable Sampling System (Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo). At each station, hydrographic parameters were recorded with a CTD-carousel system (SBE 9, Sea-Bird Scientific, Bellevue, WA, United States), which was deployed with simultaneous water sampling using Niskin bottles (General Oceanics, Inc., Miami, FL, United States). For comparison in the DNA analysis, we used stratified sediment core samples from the Peru Margin, Juan de Fuca ridge flank, and offshore of the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan, which were collected during Ocean Drilling Program ( Table 1) . For DNA extraction, all SMV sediments and the stratified sediments were frozen immediately after sampling and stored at −80 • C until use. For cell count of the SMVs sediment, 2 g of sediment was collected by using a tip-cut syringe and transferred to a 15-ml falcon tube. Subsequently, 8 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the sediment for fixation. After overnight fixation at 4 • C, the fixed sediment was washed twice with PBS buffer and stored in 50% PBS/ethanol at −20 • C. After core recovery, wet sediment was immediately sampled at 20-to 50-cm intervals and pore water samples were extracted onboard with a stainless-steel squeezer (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) . The sulfate content of pore water was analyzed using an ion chromatograph (Dionex ICS-500) with an isocratic carbonate/bicarbonate eluent coupled with suppressed conductivity detection. Analytical precision was estimated to be within 0.4% from repeated measurements of the same samples. Sediment samples for the determination of methane concentrations were collected using tip-cut plastic syringes immediately after core recovery. The syringe end was tightly capped with a silicone-rubber stopper. The sediment sample was transferred from the syringe into a glass vial in a N 2 -flushed glove bag, and then the vial was capped with a Teflon-coated rubber septum and aluminum seal for subsequent geochemical analyses. The glass vials were frozen at −20 • C and stored until analysis. In a laboratory on shore, the glass vials were heated in an oven at 60 • C for 30 min. From the glass vials, 0.1-0.5 mL of the gas phase was extracted with a gas-tight syringe and introduced into a gas chromatograph-isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer (Tsunogai et al., 2002) . The methane content was calculated by comparing the 44 CO 2 output of the isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer with those measured during analyses of a working-standard gas containing 5000 ppm methane in He. The standard deviation of repeated analysis of the laboratory standard gas was <4%. For quantification of methane in seawater, two replicate samples were collected from each Niskin bottle: two 120-ml serum vials were filled to overflowing after flushing with approximately two vial-volumes to avoid air contamination. The seawater samples were fixed by the addition of 500 µl saturated HgCl 2 solution to inhibit microbial activity during storage, sealed with gray butylrubber septa and aluminum crimp-caps, and then stored in the dark at 4 • C until analysis in the laboratory at the University of the Ryukyus (Okinawa, Japan). Dissolved methane was analyzed by purge-trap gas chromatography (GC) (GC-2014, Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector. Hydrocarbons were chromatographically separated on a Porapak Q packed column (80-100 mesh; 2-m length) operated at 40 • C using ultra-high-purity He as the carrier gas (Air Liquide, purity 99.9999%). The system was calibrated using a gas standard with a certified methane concentration (9.72 ppm) provided by Japan Fine Products (Kawasaki, Japan). The precision of the method was 10%, as estimated from the standard deviation of replicate analysis of water samples (n = 4). Cell concentrations in sediment samples were determined using a previously described procedure (Morono et al., 2013) . Briefly, after washing fixed sediment with a NaCl solution, a mixture of detergent and methanol was added and the sediment slurry was shaken for 60 min at 500 rpm using a Shake Master (Bio Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). The slurry was then sonicated and carefully layered onto a high-density cushion consisting of multiple density layers of Nycodenz and sodium polytungstate solutions. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new vial. The detergent and methanol mixture was added to the remaining pellet, and the mixture was again sonicated and centrifuged with the high-density cushion solution. The supernatants were pooled and the combined recovered suspension was filtered onto a polycarbonate membrane. For seawater samples, 300 mL of formalin-fixed seawater was directly filtered onto a polycarbonate membrane. The number of microbial cells stained by SYBR Green I was determined either using an automated cell counting system with analysis of acquired images using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) (Morono and Inagaki, 2010) , or counted manually under fluorescence microscopy. DNA was extracted from 5 g wet sediment or 300 mL seawater using the PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to manufacturer's instructions. For the seawater samples, soon after recovery of the Niskin bottles 300 mL seawater was filtered using a disposable MicroFunnel 300 Filter Unit with 0.2-µm pore size (Pall Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and stored at −20 • C prior to extraction. For a negative control, 5 mL Milli-Q water (Millipore) was used for extraction in place of sediment or seawater. The extracted DNA solution (approximately 5 mL) from sediment was further concentrated by ethanol precipitation. To increase the DNA yield, 10 µL of linear acrylamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Kanagawa, Japan) was added before centrifugation. The DNA precipitate was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.0 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) and stored at −20 • C until use. The abundance 16S rRNA genes was quantified by microfluidic digital PCR (dPCR) using the BioMark Real-time System and 12.765 Digital Array (Fluidigm Corporation, South San Francisco, CA, United States) as described elsewhere (Hoshino and Inagaki, 2012) . For each sample, 6 µL of PCR mixture was prepared as follows: 3.0 µL of 2× MightyAmp buffer (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan), 0.15 µL of Binding Dye sample loading reagent (Fluidigm), 0.12 µL of MightyAmp DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio), 0.3 µL of EvaGreen (Biotum, Fremont, CA, United States), 0.015 µL of Rox dye, 0.15 µL each of forward and reverse primer, 1.0 µL of extracted DNA, and 1.115 µL of water. We used the domain-specific primers B27F-B357R and A806F-A958R (Table 2 ) for the amplification of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, respectively. The V3-V4 hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene, which is often used for analyzing microbial diversity and community structure, was amplified by PCR using universal primers U515F/U806R (Table 2 ). The 25-µl PCR mixture consists of 0.3 µM of each primer, 1 µl of the template DNA, 1× MightyAmp Buffer Ver.2, and 0.5 µl of MightyAmp DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio). The PCR started with 2 min at 98 • C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 • C for 10 s, annealing at 55 • C for 15 s, and elongation at 68 • C for 30 s. After purification of the desired PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, index and adapter were added to the purified product during the eight cycles of second-round PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready mix (Kapa Biosystems) with 250 pg of the purified PCR product as described elsewhere (Caporaso et al., 2012) . The indexed PCR products were purified twice by AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter), and then the PCR product was sequenced by the MiSeq platform with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3, 600 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). All the purified PCR products were sequenced in a sequencing run of Miseq and account for two fifth of total clusters. Raw sequences were demultiplexed, and the sequence quality was filtered using the BaseSpace app (Illumina). Further processing, including primer trimming, sequence length screening, taxonomic identification, clustering and diversity analysis, were performed using the 'mothur' software package (v. 1.35.0) (Schloss et al., 2009 ) and USEARCH 64-bit version 1 . After the screening, the average number of sequence reads per sample was 54,410 (Supplementary Table 2 ). The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) obtained were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis using the 'vegan' package of R software as described elsewhere (Dixon, 2003; Doi and Okamura, 2011) for beta-diversity analysis of microbial communities. To exclude confounding results due to potential contaminants from the extraction process and chemicals used for PCR and sequencing, the top 10 families in the negative controls, and previously reported core-human microbiomes (Li et al., 2013) were arbitrary removed (listed in Supplementary Table 1 ). The removed top 10 families are generally consistent with laboratory and reagent contaminants in microbiome analyses (Salter et al., 2014) . We performed all the analyses in this study without removing those potential contaminant and confirmed that removal of those did not significantly affect the results (Supplementary Figures 1, 2 and Table 2 ). To detect and visualize atribacterial cells in microbial communities in the MVs, we designed a new oligonucleotide probe Atri578 (Table 2) , which can be used to detect a broad range of atribacterial sequences in the ARB Silva Database by using ARB software and mathFISH (Ludwig et al., 2004; Yilmaz et al., 2011) . The coverage of Atri578 to atribacterial sequences determined by TestProbe3.0 with the SILVA Database SSU128 is 70.6% and only two sequences in the outgroup are no-mismtach to Atri578. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled Atri578 probe was purchased from Biomers GmbH (Ulm, Germany). The optimal formamide concentration in hybridization buffer was determined by clone-FISH (Schramm et al., 2002) using a synthesized vector (Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan) containing the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of Atribacteria bacterium SCGC AAA255-N14 (ASPC01000002). We tested formamide concentrations of 0% to 60% at 10% intervals, at 35 • C and found 10% to be the optimal formamide concentration. Using this concentration, Atribacteria on the membrane filters were detected by CARD-FISH for the water column samples. The sediment samples from SMVs had very low cell number and the number of cells on the filter membrane after cell separation described above was not enough to detect Atribacteria. Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed according to a previously described protocol (Hoshino et al., 2008 (Hoshino et al., , 2015 . Briefly, hybridization was performed in hybridization buffer containing 10% formamide and 0.5 µM of the HRP-labeled Atri578 probe at 35 • C for 2 h. After washing away excess probe, the membrane filter was incubated with Alexa555-or Alexa488-labeled tyramide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 35 • C for 30 min for signal deposition, followed by counterstaining with SYBR Green I or DAPI. Sequence data obtained in this study have been submitted to the DDBJ database under accession numbers DRA005491 and DRA005492.  Sulfate concentrations in sediment pore water from both SMVs showed maxima around 25-30 mM in the uppermost sediment, with concentrations rapidly decreasing with depth (Figure 2) . In sediments deeper than 1 m below the seafloor (mbsf), sulfate was almost depleted at both SMVs. The concentration of methane was generally higher in pore water from MV#1 than MV#14, ranging from 0.5 to 13 mM and from 0.06 to 5.1 mM, respectively. Although measured concentrations varied widely probably because of depressurization of sediment, methane was depleted near the sediment surface at around 1 mbsf. The depth profiles of sulfate and methane indicate that the SMTZ was located at around 1 mbsf at both SMVs. In the overlying water column, the concentration of methane peaked to 0.71 nM at 29 m above MV#1 and to 1.93 nM at 70 m above MV#14. Those peaks indicate the occurrence of methane plume and thus advective flow from the SMVs because methane is immediately oxidized in water column and its concentration almost never reached to that high in normal water column at the similar depth (Toki et al., 2016) . Cell densities in seawater, based on counts of cells stained with SYBR Green I, were estimated to be in the range of 4.7 × 10 4 to 1.4 × 10 5 cells/ml at MV#1 and MV#14, respectively (Figure 3) . The gene abundance of 16S rRNA genes in seawater, as sum of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Figure 3) FIGURE 2 | Methane (red circles) and sulfate (blue circles) concentrations in sediment pore water at SMVs MV#1 (A) and MV#14 (B). FIGURE 3 | Microbial cell counts by SYBR Green I staining, and digital PCR (dPCR) quantification of 16S rRNA gene abundance. dPCR results are the sum of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance. dPCR results from reference sites from previous drilling expeditions are provided for comparison (see Table 1 for sampling site information). * Height above the summit of the SMVs. * * LSR, ""low statistical reliability"" because of very low, but detectable, cell numbers. quantified by microfluidic dPCR, were overall slightly lower than the cell densities. Cell counts and gene abundance from the seawater above the SMVs were relatively constant throughout the water column at 5 × 10 3 copies/ml and 6 × 10 4 cells/ml (Top panel of Figure 3 ) up to around 400 m above the summit, the upper limit of sample collection. The cell concentrations in the shallowest sediment samples from the seafloor were 2.4 × 10 2 and 1.3 × 10 5 cells/g-wet sediment for MV#1 and MV#14, respectively. Cell concentrations at the two SMVs dropped sharply to only 20 and 13 cells/g-wet sediment at 0.58 and 0.51 mbsf, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene abundance for MV#1 in the uppermost sediment sample was 3.3 × 10 3 copies/g-wet sediment, which is an order of magnitude higher than the cell concentration, whereas the cell counts in the uppermost sediment at MV#14 were higher than the 16S rRNA gene abundance (8.0 × 10 3 copies/g-wet sediment). The 16S rRNA gene abundance in sediment from depths greater than 1.5 mbsf were 10-100 times the cell concentrations. Throughout the sediment cores, MV#1 generally had lower 16S rRNA gene abundance than MV#14, and the gene abundance at MV#1 decreased to about 1 × 10 2 copies at 1.1 mbsf. At MV#14, the 16S rRNA gene abundance gradually decreased with increasing depth to 4.7 × 10 2 copies/g-wet sediment at 3.0 mbsf, the deepest sediment sampled. The estimated 16S rRNA gene abundance as well as cell concentrations in the deeper mud volcano sediments were markedly lower than those in shallow seafloor sediments and in other stratified subseafloor sediments on Pacific margins collected during previous IODP expeditions. In general, the abundance of 16S rRNA genes in the SMVs varied from 10 1 to 10 5 copies/g-wet sediment, which is two to seven orders of magnitude lower than in stratified sedimentary environments (Figure 3) . The cell counts are higher than the gene abundance in the water column in this study, whereas in the sediment the trend was opposite to the water column. The reasons of formar discrepancy can be partially explained by biases as low DNA extraction efficiency or false positive counts of fluorescence-emitting particles (Lloyd et al., 2013) . The latter might be caused by low recovery of cells from very sticky texture of the MV sediment. In any case, the results from both methods are consistent with the general trends; (1) Higher microbial abundance in the overlying seawater than mud volcano sediment: (2) Decrease of microbial abundance with sediment depth. We obtained around 1.6 million sequences in total by Miseq sequencing of SMV sediment and overlying seawater samples (Supplementary Table 2 ). Phylum-level classification showed the predominance of Proteobacteria in all seawater samples, comprising more than 50% in all sequence libraries (Figure 4) . The taxonomic composition of microbial communities in seawater was generally constant at both sites and at different depths. The second most representative phylum was Marinimicrobia (formerly SAR405), comprising 10-14% of the total community, followed by Thaumarchaeota comprising 5-15%. In contrast, the community composition of mud volcano sediments was markedly different from that in the water column, even at the phylum level; for example, Marinimicrobia was nearly absent in sediment samples. The MV community composition was also distinct from those of the reference stratified sediment (Supplementary Figure 4) . In addition, the community compositions at the two mud volcano sites were notably different: Proteobacteria was dominant at MV#1, comprising between 21 and 58% of the total, whereas Atribacteria FIGURE 4 | Microbial community composition in the sediment and overlying seawater at two SMVs using phylum-level classification. Only the top 20 phyla are shown. Numbers in parentheses show the water column depth (meters above the SMV summit) for water samples (labels that start with ""w"") and depth in sediment for sediment samples (labels that start with numbers). (formerly OP9 and JS1) comprised 21-88 and 0.7-39% of total sequence reads at MV#14 and MV#1, respectively. Some phyla, such as Firmicutes, Aerophobetes (formerly CD12), and Aminicenantes were prevalent only in the sediment samples. The degree of similarity between microbial communities in sediment and seawater was determined by nMDS analysis applied to OTUs with >97% similarity (Figure 5) . Microbial communities in the overlying seawater from 200 to 300 m above the mud volcano summits were generally similar. Compared to the seawater communities, microbial communities in sediments were more diverse, even across very small changes in depth at 2 and 6 mbsf for the SMVs and reference stratified marginal sediments. Microbial communities in stratified sediments were grouped into one cluster despite being collected from geographically distinct sites, whereas the microbial communities in SMV sediments were different from those in both the stratified sediments and in the overlying water column. A gradation in microbial composition is evident from deep to shallow sediment within both SMVs. These trends suggest that physical and chemical conditions may affect microbial composition more than can be explained by the conditions in well-stratified sediment. The nMDS plots (Figure 5 ) also indicate that shallower SMV sediment communities, especially at MV#14, are similar to those in normal stratified marine sediments. This difference might suggest differences in activity of the SMVs: if MV#1 is more active than MV#14, the seafloor at MV#14 would be covered with marine sediments freshly deposited since the last eruption; consequently, shallower sediments at MV#14 would harbor the microbial communities that typically occur in the surrounding stratified sediments. We identified the common OTUs in all SMV sediment and seawater samples to determine whether mud volcano activity dispersed some of the community members of the subseafloor sedimentary habitats at SMVs to the overlying seawater. We found only one OTU (i.e., OTU-1) common to all of the samples examined for both sites (MV#1 and MV#14). OTU-1 is the most abundant OTU in the SMV sediment samples, comprising 1.4-38 and 22-85% of the sequence reads from MV#1 and MV#14, respectively. OTU-1 sequences are affiliated with Atribacteria, which is well-known as a predominant taxonomic clade of marine sedimentary bacteria (e.g., Inagaki et al., 2006; Webster et al., 2006b; Blazejak and Schippers, 2010) ; almost all Atribacteriarelated sequences detected in this study are included in this OTU (Supplementary Figure 5) . The relative abundance of OTU-1-related sequences was generally low in seawater samples, comprising less than 0.1% of total reads. This abundance peaked, however, to more than 0.7% at 39 m (MV#1) and 52 m (MV#14) above the summits of both SMVs and returned to around 0.1% above this depth (Figure 6) . Interestingly, the depth profile of methane similarly peaked at 19 m (MV#1) and 72 m (MV#14) above the summit, indicating the presence of Atribacteria in methane plumes emanating from the SMVs. Because the relative abundance of OTU-1 in sequence libraries are not necessarily quantitative, we verified the presence and abundance of Atribacteria in seawater samples by CARD-FISH using the newly designed probe Atri578, which specifically targets the Atribacteria-related sequences detected in this study and related sequences in publicly available databases (Figure 7) . CARD-FISH analysis showed that Atribacteria in the water column were most abundant at 39 m (MV#1) and 52 m (MV#14) above the respective summits; results overall in good agreement with the relative abundance of OTU-1 sequence. Consequently, we infer that Atribacteria inhabiting the subseafloor sediments at SMVs are dispersed into the overlying seawater along with the methane plume. The mechanisms of dispersal of microbial life from the deep biosphere to the Earth's surface biosphere remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed that deep-biosphere microbial communities are transported from deep subseafloor sedimentary environments to the ocean through the activity of SMVs; specifically, members of the Atribacteria, typically observed in the global subseafloor sedimentary environment, were found to be present in methane plumes above two SMVs. The deep-sea hydrothermal systems have been well-studied and dispersal of thermophilic microbial communities to the ocean has been well-known (Deming and Baross, 1993; Takai et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2006) . However, the diffused microbial communities inhabit around the surface of vents due to the high temperature of hydrothemal fluid and those do not come from FIGURE 6 | Depth profiles of methane concentrations, relative abundance of OTU-1 in the sequence library, and cell numbers of Atribacteria as detected by CARD-FISH using probe Atri578. OTU-1 is the most abundant OTU affiliated with Atribacteria. deep biosphere. In contrast to those systems, little is known about the dispersal and transport of microorganisms from the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere to the overlying hydrosphere. A recent molecular ecological study of microbial communities in marine sediments and the overlying seawater showed that some of the OTUs represented by abundant sequences in the sediment are also present but represented by rare sequences in the water column population (Walsh et al., 2016) ; however, the possible mechanism or the driving force for the dispersal remains unknown. In this study, we examined these scientific questions at two SMVs off Tanegashima Island, Japan. We found that Atribacteria-related sequences were prevalent throughout the sediment and overlying water column at both SMVs examined. One of the atribacterial phylotypes (i.e., OTU-1) was commonly present in all samples. It is possible that only a very small portion of the sedimentary microbial cells can be diffused from sticky mud volcano sediments into the overlying water column, so we might only be able to detect the most abundant deep biosphere-derived OTUs because of the sensitivity of sequencing analysis. In support of this idea, the second most abundant OTU in the sequence libraries of the sedimentary microbial community (OTU-12, within the Aerophobetes) was found in the water column and showed a profile similar to those of OTU-1 and Atribacteria cell counts (Supplementary Figure 6) . These consistent results suggest that there might be no selection of microbial phylotypes in the dispersal process, and hence sedimentary microbes are evenly dispersed to the overlying seawater along with discharging gasses and fluids. The candidate division JS-1 affiliated with Atribacteria was originally found in the sediment from Japan Sea (Rochelle et al., 1994) , and meanwhile the widespread distribution of this group was reported in marine sediments including organic rich deepsea sediment (Webster et al., 2006a) , shallow marine sediment (Oni et al., 2015) , tidal flats (Webster et al., 2007) and methane hydrate bearing sediment (Reed et al., 2002; Inagaki et al., 2003 Inagaki et al., , 2006 . Their relative abundance often comprised higher than 50% of sequence libraries (Newberry et al., 2004; Inagaki et al., 2006; Carr et al., 2015) . Those high abundances of Atribacteria in the methane rich sediments imply that this group was selected in high methane concentrations. In general, sediments of mud volcanoes contain high mathane concentrations and would be suitable enviromnent for Atribacteira as reported in Amsterdam mud volcano (Pachiadaki et al., 2011) . The dominance of Atribacteria in MV#1 and MV#14 in this study was consistent with those previous studies. At the Vodyanitskiy mud volcano in the Black Sea, it has been hypothesized that ANME-1 and ANME-2 archaea are associated with methane bubbles and participate in AOM in the anoxic water column (Schubert et al., 2006) . In this study, we detected methane plumes together with atribacterial cells in the oxic water column, which is an environment very different from the deep sedimentary biosphere. We semi-quantitatively compared the frequency of 16S rRNA genes of OTU-1 between seawater and sediment samples, although the number of atribacterial cells in seawater visualized by CARD-FISH could not be directly compared to those in sediment samples, for which estimates were not technically possible because of the low in situ cell densities. Our results showed that, in methane plumes, the highest abundance of OTU-1 in the sequence library approached 1% relative abundance for MV#1 and MV#14 (Figure 6 ). These abundances are much higher than previously reported, where the highest relative abundance of sedimentary communities in the water column was 0.025% for normal sedimentary environments in the open ocean (Walsh et al., 2016) . The total abundance of 16S rRNA genes determined by microfluidic dPCR in methane plumes was 1.4 × 10 4 copies/ml in samples from both SMVs. By multiplying the proportion of sequence by the gene abundance, we estimated the density of OTU-1 16S rRNA genes to be 1.2 × 10 2 copies/ml and 1.1 × 10 2 copies/ml for MV#1 and MV#14, respectively. The gene abundance in sediment pore water can be similarly estimated under the assumption that bulk density and porosity of the sediment are 1.8 g/ml and 50%, respectively (i.e., using shipboard results available in the Cruise Report of D/V Chikyu training cruise CK09-01, Leg. 1 2 ). The estimated abundance of OTU-1 16S rRNA genes in the topmost sediment of MV#1 and MV#14 are 4.4 × 10 3 and 6.3 × 10 3 copies/ml pore water, respectively, which are only 37-and 57-fold higher than those in the methane plumes in the water column at 32 and 39 m above the respective SMVs. Given these estimates, we infer that there could be a supply of substantial amounts of the subseafloor microbial community to the overlying seawater, for which we propose the term ""deepbiosphere plume."" Once sedimentary microbial components are released into the water column, it is likely that they are transported via currents as ""deep-biosphere seeds"" into the ocean, perhaps over long distances, as previously discussed for thermospores found in arctic sediments (Hubert et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, at this point, it is difficult to quantify the deep-biosphere seeds, constantly or episodically dispersed from SMVs along with methane and fluids. To expand our understanding of this interesting phenomenon involving geosystem-ecosystem interactions will require continuous monitoring of the geobiological system over a wide spatial range through future deep-sea research and ocean drilling opportunities. 2 www.godac.jamstec.go.jp In this study, by using the Atri578 probe targeting Atribacteria for CARD-FISH, we confirmed the presence of sedimentary Atribacteria in methane plumes (Figure 7) . The detected atribacterial cells were individualized cocci (diameter approximately 1.0 µm), not forming aggregates or attached to any particulate matter. Our CARD-FISH observations suggest that the Atribacteria are generally free-living in the sediment pore water rather than tightly attached to the minerals. Because CARD-FISH detects rRNA inside individual cells, the detected cells may have been still alive and in their in situ metabolic state. This led us to hypothesize that deep-biosphere seeds of Atribacteria will colonize new habitats on the seafloor and revive to start growing, freshly deposited in a sedimentary habitat after traveling a long distance in the ocean. Previous studies of the partial genome sequence of Atribacteria indicated that they are heterotrophic anaerobes that ferment organic acids, such as propionate, and produce the fermentation products acetate, ethanol, and CO 2 (Carr et al., 2015; Nobu et al., 2016) . Their fermentation products may therefore directly or syntrophically support methanogenesis or acetogenesis; that is, the terminal metabolic processes in the anoxic heterotrophic microbial ecosystem. In addition, it is worth noting that there have been no functional genes for methanotrophy so far identified in the known Atribacteriaderived genome sequences. This suggests that there may be little or no biogeochemical contributions from Atribacteria in methane plumes if they are just surviving and drifting in the water column. Their biogeochemical activities would resume when these deep-biosphere seeds are safely redeposited on the seafloor and buried back into the anoxic sedimentary habitat. The number of cells in MV#1 and MV#14 sediment samples was much lower than in well-stratified sediment core samples from Pacific margin sites. In addition, the shallower mud volcano sediment in this study contained only 10 2 -10 5 cells/g-wet, which is several orders of magnitude lower than the 10 8 -10 9 cells/cm 3 in very active and water-rich SMVs (e.g., Håkon Mosby mud volcano; Losekann et al., 2007) . This implies that cell densities in the deeper zones of MV#1 and MV#14 are possibly much lower than in other, more active SMVs. Because the SMVs near Tanegashima originated from Eocene strata (Ujiie, 2000) , it is possible that the low cell concentrations in the mud volcano sediment at this site can be explained by sediment matrices that are too deep and too old to support microbial life, and the geosystem may lack both available electron donors and acceptors. This, however, is still an open question. In this study, we investigated microbial communities at two SMVs off Tanegashima Island, Japan, using second generation sequencing, microfluidic digital PCR, image-based cell counts, and CARD-FISH techniques. Beta diversity of sediment and water-column microbial communities, as well as cell-count and gene quantification data, consistently indicated that microbial community compositions in mud volcano sediments are very distinct from those in well-stratified marginal sediments and water columns. Sedimentary Atribacteria were present in methane plumes in the overlying water column, suggesting microbial dispersal from the deep sedimentary biosphere to the overlying hydrosphere through submarine mud volcano activity. These findings suggest that a transmigration of ""deep-biosphere seeds"" may occur between the Earth's surface and subsurface biospheres.

207696802,Two new species of scale worms (Polychaeta: Aphroditiformia) from deep-sea habitats in the Gulf of Cadiz (NE Atlantic),"Two new species of scale worms are described from the Gulf of Cadiz (NE Atlantic), at depths between 1100 and 2230 m. Australaugeneria iberica sp. nov. (Polynoidae) was obtained from an alcyonarian colony collected at the flank of Carlos Ribeiro mud volcano; it is characterized by the presence of neuropodial hooks only on segment two and by having the first parapodia not enlarged. This is the first report of the genus for the deep sea. The diagnosis of Australaugeneria is emended and a table comparing all species of the genus is provided. Pholoe petersenae sp. nov. (Pholoidae) was collected from the crater of three mud volcanoes (Darwin, Captain Arutyunov and Carlos Ribeiro) in areas of active seepage. This species is characterized by the presence of prostomial peaks and parapodia stylodes and the absence of eyes.","The Gulf of Cadiz is an extensive cold seepage area located west of the Strait of Gibraltar (NE Atlantic), enclosed by the southern Iberian margin and the northern margin of Morocco. It comprises over 40 known mud volcanoes and adjacent deep-sea habitats (cold water corals, carbonate crusts, gorgonian and sponge aggregations) at depths ranging from 200 to 4000 m. The diverse fauna of this region is greatly promoted by the high habitat heterogeneity of the area (Cordes et al. 2010) , weak hydrocarbon fluxes, varied biogeochemical settings and complex water circulation, that ensures oceanographic connectivity with the Mediterranean Sea as well as with the Equatorial and North Atlantic regions (Cunha et al. 2013a) . The specimens reported here were found during a polychaete study of samples taken over the past 15 years from 27 mud volcanoes and adjacent habitats in the Gulf of Cadiz. Scale worms belonging to the families Acoetidae Kinberg, 1856 , Polynoidae Kinberg, 1856 , Pholoidae Kinberg, 1858 and Sigalionidae Malmgren, 1867 were recorded from 15 of these mud volcanoes. The new species described here are assigned to the families Polynoidae, genus Australaugeneria Pettibone, 1969a, and Pholoidae, genus Pholoe Johnston, 1839. The genus Australaugeneria was erected by Pettibone (1969a) for the species Polynoe rutilans Grube, 1878 and later emended by Pettibone (1969b) to accommodate the species A. pottsi. At present, this genus includes only three species-A. rutilans (Grube, 1878) , A. michaelseni Pettibone, 1969a and A. pottsi Pettibone, 1969 -found in the Indian and Pacific oceans at shelf depths, often associated with alcyonarians and gorgonians (Pettibone 1969a, b) . The genus Pholoe, although common in marine benthos, is often overlooked due to the small size of their specimens. The NE Atlantic shallow water Pholoe species have often been erroneously identified as P. minuta (Fabricius, 1780) , a NW Atlantic species (Petersen 1998) . This is also the reason for the confusion concerning the type species of the genus, P. inornata Johnston, 1839 , that was subsequently referred to P. minuta by Malmgren 1865. Much of the material assigned to P. minuta has been re-examined by Pettibone (1992) and Petersen (1998) but a comprehensive revision of the genus is required. The genus includes 15 species of which six are distributed within N Atlantic waters-P. longa (O. F. Müller, 1776) from Greenland, P. inornata Johnston, 1839, British Isles, P. baltica Örsted, 1843, P. assimilis Örsted, 1845, Danish waters, P. fauveli Kirkegaard, 1983 , Bay of Biscay and Azores, P. pallida Chambers, 1985 , British waters. With the exception of P. fauveli, these species are found mainly at shallow depths (Petersen 1998) . Other deep-sea species are known, but not yet described (Petersen, unpublished data) . A comparison table for all species of Pholoe can be found in Padovanni & Amaral (2013) . The Australaugeneria specimens were collected during a ROV dive of the cruise JC10-1 (RRS James Cook, project HERMES) at Carlos Ribeiro mud volcano (MV). The Pholoe specimens were found in sediment samples from Captain Arutyunov and Carlos Ribeiro MVs taken during the cruises TTR14 (RV Prof. Logachev, Training Through Research programme, IOC-UNESCO) and MSM01-03 (RV Maria S. Merian, project HERMES) and in a wood colonization experiment retrieved two years after deployment at Darwin MV (cruise B09-14b, RV Belgica, project CHEMECO). Metadata of the sampling sites are provided in Table 1 and the location of the mud volcanoes is shown in Figure 1 . The Darwin MV is located in the Moroccan Carbonate Province, and Captain Arutyunov and Carlos Ribeiro MVs are located in the Deep-water field. Details on the environmental setting of the latter two mud volcanoes can be found in Cunha et al. (2013a) . An account of the colonization experiments and a brief description of Darwin MV are provided by Cunha et al. (2013b) . Whenever possible the specimens were sorted on board and preserved in 96% ethanol. Drawings were prepared from preserved specimens with a camera lucida. Measurements of body width were taken from the widest part of the body, excluding chaetae. Body length excludes prostomium appendages and anal cirrus. Type specimens were deposited in the Natural History Museum, London (NHM), and the remaining material was deposited in the Biological Research Collection, Departamento de Biologia, Universidade de Aveiro (DBUA).

Type species. Polynoe rutilans Grube, 1878. Diagnosis. Body dorsoventrally flattened, tapering posteriorly, less than 40 segments. Elytra 15 pairs on segments 2, 4, 5, 7, alternating to 23, 26, 29, 32. Elytra soft, translucent, smooth. Prostomium margin rounded without cephalic peaks. Ceratophore of median antenna inserted in anterior notch. Ceratophores of lateral antennae inserted anteroventrally. Palps stout, gradually tapering. Eyes present or absent. Tentacular segment with two pairs of tentacular cirri, without chaetae. Second segment (buccal segment) without nuchal fold, without or with few notochaetae, with hooked neurochaetae. Parapodia of later segments sub-biramous. Notopodia with projecting acicular lobe. Neuropodia long, with well-developed pre-and postchaetal lamellae. Prechaetal lamellae of segments 2 and 3 may be more or less strongly enlarged, hood-like, enclosing hooked chaetae. Notochaetae few, stouter or more slender than neurochaetae, smooth or spinulose, tips unidentate. Neurochaetae present as stout hooks in anteriormost segments, those of following segments curved, smooth or faintly spinulose below more or less strongly hooked tips, sometimes bidentate, with a small secondary tooth. Remarks. Pettibone (1969a, b) considered the notochaeta of A. rutilans and A. pottsi as bidentate, however Wehe (2006) disagreed arguing that the bidentate appearance of the chaetae is due to the long series of spines along the convex notochaetal edge reaching almost to the tip of the chaetae. This feature was confirmed by Dr. Gordon Paterson that examined one syntype of A. pottsi (BMNH1924:3:1:77) on our behalf. Description. Examined specimens incomplete, only one specimen with one elytron. Larger fragment with 18 segments, 5.09 mm long and 1.09 / 2.69 mm wide without and with parapodia, respectively.

Acanella sp.), collected at the flank (no methane seepage detected) of Carlos Ribeiro MV, at 2230 m water depth. Etymology. The species name refers to its type locality on the Iberian margin. Remarks. The genus Australaugeneria includes three species, A. rutilans (Grube, 1878) and A. michaelseni Pettibone, 1969a, both from southwest Australia, 11-16 m depth, and A. pottsi Pettibone, 1969b from the Maldives Islands. Recently, A. rutilans was also reported from the Red Sea (Wehe, 2006) . Australaugeneria iberica sp. nov. differs from the other three species in having neuropodial hooks on segment two only (instead of two and three) and prechaetal lobes of the first parapodia are not enlarged or hood-like. Both characters are diagnostic of the genus and its diagnosis is emended here. Further differences between the four species are highlighted in Table 2 . This is the first deep-sea species of the genus, as well as the first record for the Atlantic Ocean. Family Pholoidae Kinberg, 1858 Genus Pholoe Johnston, 1839 Pholoe Johnston 1839, p. 437.

An additional specimen was retrieved from wood colonization experiments which were deployed for about two years on the crater of Darwin MV typically covered by carbonate slabs and clumps of bathymodiolin mussels. Water depth range from 1100 to 2204 m. Etymology. The species epithet is given in memory of Dr. Mary Petersen who gathered a large amount of information on Pholoe species while revising the genus for an unpublished monograph. Remarks. Besides P. petersenae sp. n., there are presently four described species of Pholoe lacking eyes, two of which are recorded from the Atlantic Ocean, P. pallida Chambers, 1985 and P. anoculata Hartman, 1965 . Pholoe pallida was first described from off St. Abbs (Scotland) and it is only known from the North Sea area at near-shore depths (Chambers & Muir 1997; Petersen 1998) , although Chambers (1985) refers to a possible confusion between this species and P. minuta, and that all records of the latter require revision. The specimens examined herein were collected in the Gulf of Cadiz at deeper waters, and differ from P. pallida mainly by having prostomial peaks and neuropodia stylodes (both absent on P. pallida), neurochaetae with longer blades, and cirriform instead of flaskshape papillae on the elytra margins. Pholoe anoculata is a western Atlantic species occurring from 400 to 5000 m depth, which like the specimens examined here, have nearly smooth elytra with scattered slender fringing papillae and neurochaetae with longer blades (Hartman & Fauchald 1971) . Our specimens seem to be morphologically closer to this latter species, but differ from it again by having prostomial peaks and neuropodia stylodes and also neurochaetae shafts with subdistal rows of spines instead of being smooth as stated by Hartman and Fauchald (1971) . Previous records of P. anoculata from off Northumberland (UK) (Christie 1982) were erroneous and were later ascribed to P. pallida (Chambers 1985) . A review of these and other species, preferably with the inclusion of molecular data, is required to evaluate their phylogenetic relationships and to define their morphological differences.",Ascensão Ravara,2016,27394559,10.11646/zootaxa.4097.3.12
22414992,"Novel archaeal macrocyclic diether core membrane lipids in a methane-derived carbonate crust from a mud volcano in the Sorokin Trough, NE Black Sea.","A methane-derived carbonate crust was collected from the recently discovered NIOZ mud volcano in the Sorokin Trough, NE Black Sea during the 11th Training-through-Research cruise of the R/V Professor Logachev. Among several specific bacterial and archaeal membrane lipids present in this crust, two novel macrocyclic diphytanyl glycerol diethers, containing one or two cyclopentane rings, were detected. Their structures were tentatively identified based on the interpretation of mass spectra, comparison with previously reported mass spectral data, and a hydrogenation experiment. This macrocyclic type of archaeal core membrane diether lipid has so far been identified only in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent methanogen Methanococcus jannaschii. Here, we provide the first evidence that these macrocyclic diethers can also contain internal cyclopentane rings. The molecular structure of the novel diethers resembles that of dibiphytanyl tetraethers in which biphytane chains, containing one and two pentacyclic rings, also occur. Such tetraethers were abundant in the crust. Compound-specific isotope measurements revealed delta13C values of -104 to -111/1000 for these new archaeal lipids, indicating that they are derived from methanotrophic archaea acting within anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia, which subsequently induce authigenic carbonate formation.","Geological exploration of the ocean floor has revealed widely occurring fields of submarine fluid discharge, so-called ""cold seeps"" or ""methane seeps,"" which create specific structures on the sea floor such as mud volcanoes and pockmarks (Hovland and Judd 1988 , Limonov et al. 1994 , 1997 , Ivanov et al. 1996a , 1996b . In these settings, constant and focused fluid supply induces marked biological activity depending on chemosynthetic nutrition (Hovland and Judd 1988 , Sibuet et al. 1988 , Corselli and Basso 1996 , Olu et al. 1996 , 1997 , Sibuet and Olu 1998 . Specifically, it is manifested in the appearance and diversity of chemoautotrophic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) thriving in the unique environments created by strong advection of altered methane-rich fluids (Sassen et al. 1993 , Cragg et al. 1996 , Lanoil et al. 2001 . The most important processes fueling these light-independent biological communities are the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane. Numerous field and laboratory observations have indicated that, in areas of intensive hydrocarbon gas venting, anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is the dominant pathway for methane consumption. It has been proposed that AOM is performed by methanogenic archaea, acting in reverse, in tandem with sulfate-reducing bacteria consuming the formed hydrogen, which makes the reaction thermodynamically feasible (Reeburgh 1976 , Zender and Brock 1979 , Alperin and Reeburgh 1985 , Hoehler et al. 1994 . Recently, multiple lines of investigation have demonstrated the ability of archaea to use methane as a carbon source, i.e., to act as methanotrophic organisms. The light carbon isotopic composition of archaeal membrane lipids revealed that archaea incorporated isotopically light, methane-derived carbon into their cell carbon (Hinrichs et al. 1999 , Elvert et al. 2000 , Hinrichs et al. 2000b , 2001a , 2001b , Thiel et al. 2001 , Zhang et al. 2002 , Teske et al. 2002 . In association with isotopically depleted archaeal membrane lipids, lipids derived from sulfate-reducing bacteria have been found in varying distributions (Pancost et al. , 2001a . These lipids are also substantially depleted in δ 13 C, albeit slightly less so than the archaeal lipids, indicating involvement of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the microbial community engaged in AOM. The best evidence of a consortium of archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria was obtained by comparison of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, which showed that methane-oxidizing archaea are phylogenetically associated with the methanogenic orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales (Hinrichs et al. 1999 , 2000b , Boetius et al. 2000 , Orphan et al. 2001 , Teske et al. 2002 , and that their cell aggregates are surrounded by exosymbiotic, nutritionally versatile sulfate-reducing bacteria (Boetius et al. 2000 , Orphan et al. 2001 . The most distinct chemotaxonomic markers of archaea are the presence of ether core membrane lipids composed of isoprenoidal units linked to a glycerol moiety (Langworthy et al. 1982 , De Rosa et al. 1983 , Comita et al. 1984 , Langworthy 1985 , Hoefs et al. 1997 , Schouten et al. 1998 , 2001a , 2001b . Glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs; see Appendix I for structures) are known to occur in archaeal membranes and may contain from zero to eight cyclopentane rings (De Rosa et al. 1983, De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988) . The presence of cyclopentane rings within biphytanyl chains is well known in (hyper)thermophilic archaea, whereas methanogenic archaea contain predominantly GDGTs with no cyclopentane rings. Recently, crenarchaeol (Compound XII, Appendix I), a GDGT with four cyclopentane rings and one distinctive cyclohexane ring, has been suggested as a specific core membrane lipid for non-thermophilic planktonic Crenarchaeota widely observed in low-temperature marine environments , Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002a . Glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers with zero to three cyclopentane rings are derived from methanotrophic archaea in the Eastern Mediterranean cold seep areas (Pancost et al. 2001b , Aloisi et al. 2002 . Diphytanyl glycerol diethers (DGDs; see Appendix I for structures) are also common archaeal core membrane lipids, which could be considered archaeal counterparts of the conventional diglycerides of eukaryotic origin. They are characterized by unusual 2,3-sn glycerol stereochemistry (De Rosa et al. 1991) . Archaeol (Compound IV, Appendix I) (2,3-bis-O-phytanyl glycerol diether) and hydroxyarchaeols (sn-2 and sn-3 isomers; Compounds V and VI, respectively (Appendix I)) are the universal archaeal core membrane lipids formed by condensation via ether linkage between two C 20 isoprenoid alcohols and a glycerol molecule Gambacorta 1988, De Rosa et al. 1991) . The sn-2 and sn-3 isomers of hydroxyarchaeol have been identified in cultured members of Methanosarcinales (Sprott et al. 1990 , Nishihara and Koga 1991 , Koga et al. 1993 . The major producers of sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol are Methanosarcina spp., whereas the sn-3 isomer has been observed in Methanosaeta concilii (Sprott et al. 1993) . Based on the wide occurrence of these lipids in methane seepage areas (Hinrichs et al. 1999 , 2000a , Boetius et al. 2000 , Elvert et al. 2000 , Pancost et al. 2001b ) and their extremely depleted δ 13 C values, which indicates methane consumption, these archaeal lipids are widely used as indicators of AOM. Here we report a new type of archaeal core membrane ether lipid in a methane-derived carbonate crust collected from the NIOZ mud volcano recently discovered in the Sorokin Trough, NE Black Sea. The novel macrocyclic isoprenoidal glycerol diethers contain one or two cyclopentyl rings in their biphytanyl chain. The distinct molecular structure of these lipids, together with compound-specific carbon isotopic data, indicate that they are derived from a new group of archaea capable of oxidizing methane anaerobically. The Sorokin Trough is one of the large depressions in the deep part of the Black Sea, extending along the south-eastern margin of the Crimea Peninsula with a length of 150 km, a width of 45-50 km and a water depth of 600-2100 m (Tugolesov et al. 1985) (Figure 1 ). The trough is well known for the occurrence of mud diapiric structures of Oligocene-Early Miocene age. Some of these diapirs are topped by mud volcanoes (Ivanov et al. 1998) . A high gas content was noted in the uppermost part of the sedimentary sequence in the form of both free gas and gas hydrate accumulations (Bouriak and Akhmetzhanov 1998) . Hydrocarbon gas profiles show a characteristic decrease in methane concentration in the uppermost part of the sedimentary column (Stadnitskaia 1997 ). This effect is well documented as a distinctive imprint on the sedimentary geochemical record caused by methane consumption (Barners and Goldberg 1976, Bernard 1979) . During the 11th Training-through-Research expedition (TTR-11) of the Russian R/V Professor Logachev in JulySeptember 2001, a mud volcano (44°19′ N, 35°04′ E) was discovered on the basis of MAK-1, high-resolution, deep-towed, side-scan sonar data and named ""NIOZ"" mud volcano. A total of five sediment cores were subsequently taken from the crater of the NIOZ mud volcano at a water depth of 2020 m. Four of the cores (TTR-11 BS-325G, TTR-11 BS-326G, TTR-11 BS-327G and TTR-11 BS-328G) recovered carbonate crusts. The carbonate crust that we examined and which we describe here was collected from sampling site TTR-11 BS-328G (Figure 1) . The crust (17 × 9 × 1.5 cm) was associated with spherical, drop-sized, brownish microbial mats, which filled the pores and cavities on the surface and interior of the carbonate crust.  Bottom sampling was performed according to standard TTR procedures, as described in Ivanov et al. (1992) . The crust TTR-11 BS-328G-2 was collected from the NIOZ mud volcano with a gravity corer. The sample was described and photographed and then stored at -20 °C until lipid extraction. About 100 g of crust was freeze-dried, crushed to a fine powder, and extracted with dichloromethane:methanol (9:1, v/v) using the Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE 200, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) at 6895 kPa and 100°C. Elemental sulfur was removed from the total extract by flushing the extract over a small pipette filled with activated copper. An aliquot of the total extract was chromatographically separated into apolar and polar fractions using a column with activated (2 h at 150°C) Al 2 O 3 as the stationary phase. Apolar compounds were obtained using hexane:dichloromethane (9:1, v/v) as eluent, and polar compounds, including glycerol ether core membrane lipids, were obtained with the eluent dichloromethane:methanol (1:1, v/v). A known amount of 2,3-dimethyl-5-(1,1-dideuterohexadecyl)-thiophene (C 22 H 38 SD 2 ) was added to each fraction as an internal standard. Alcohols were transformed to trimethylsilyl derivatives by adding 25 µl of pyridine and 25 µl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and heating at 60 °C for 20 min. Hydrogenation was performed in ethyl acetate with H 2 , a few drops of acetic acid and PtO 2 for 1 h. The sample was then stirred for 8 h at room temperature. Gas chromatography (GC) was performed with a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an on-column injector and a flame ionization detector. A fused silica capillary column (CPsil5 25 m × 0.32 mm, df = 0.12 µm) with helium as the carrier gas was used. The samples were injected at 70°C; thereafter, the temperature was increased to 130°C at a rate of 20°C min -1 , and then to 320°C at a rate of 4°C min -1 , where it was held constant for 15 min. The polar fraction was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for compound identification. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted with a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph interfaced to a VG Autospec Ultima Q (Micromass, Manchester, U.K.) mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV with a mass range of m/z 50-800 and a cycle time of 1.8 s (resolution 1000). The gas chromatograph was equipped with a fused silica capillary column (CPsil5 25 m × 0.32 mm, df = 0.12 µm) and helium as the carrier gas. The temperature program used for GC-MS was the same as for GC. Isotope ratio monitoring-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on a Finnigan MAT DELTA plus XL (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) instrument to determine compound-specific δ 13 C values. The GC was a Hewlett Packard 6890A series and the analytical conditions were the same as those used for GC and GC-MS. For carbon isotopic correction of the added trimethylsilyl groups, we used BSTFA with a known carbon isotopic composition (-49.29 ± 0.5‰). Values are reported in ‰ relative to the PeeDee belemnite standard, and have been corrected for the addition of an Si(CH 3 ) 3 group during the derivatization procedure. To monitor the accuracy of the measurements, the analyses were carried out with co-injection of two standards, C 20 and C 24 n-alkanes, with known isotopic composition. To determine the distribution and composition of intact glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), the underivatized polar fraction of the carbonate crust was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry according to Hopmans et al. (2000) .   Analysis of the polar fraction of the carbonate crust TTR-11 BS-328G-2 by GC-MS revealed a suite of ether lipids diagnostic of the non-thermophilic group of the euryarchaeota and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Figure 2) . Two isoprenoidal diphytanyl glycerol diethers (DGDs) distinctive for methanotrophic archaea (Hinrichs et al. 1999 (Hinrichs et al. , 2000a were identified. Archaeol (Compound IV, Appendix I) is the most abundant ether lipid. The sn-3 isomer of hydroxyarchaeol (Compound VI) was also detected in relatively high abundance. Series of non-isoprenoidal DGDs (Compounds I, II and III), previously reported as markers of sulfate-reducing bacteria (Pancost et al. 2001a) , were also identified in the crust. Diphytanyl glycerol diethers with anteiso alkyl chains (Compound I), and with a cyclopropane ring in the alkyl chain attached to the glycerol group at position 2 (Compound II), were most abundant. Dicyclic biphytane diol (Compound VII; Schouten et al. 1998) was also present in the carbonate crust, but in small amounts relative to the other archaeal and bacterial lipids. It is probably also derived from archaea involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) (Pancost et al. 2001b , Teske et al. 2002 . In addition to these well-known archaeal and bacterial lipids, two relatively abundant, unknown compounds (A and B) were observed ( Figure 2 ). Their mass spectra (Figure 3 ) are similar to that of the macrocyclic biphytanyl glycerol diether, the core membrane lipid of the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii (Comita et al. 1984) . The mass spectra of compounds A and B show intense fragment ions at m/z 145, which arise from loss of the entire biphytanyl moiety and a hydroxy group, C 3 H 4 O 2 Si(CH 3 ) 3 (Comita et al. 1984) . The presence of relatively abundant fragment ions at M (Wood 1980) , and those at m/z 130, 131 and 132 are related to the C 2 H 3 O 2 Si(CH 3 ) 3 moiety, indicating that the Si(CH 3 ) 3 fragment is attached to the glycerol group at the 1 or 3 position (Pancost et al. 2001a ). These mass spectral fragmentation characteristics suggested that A and B are also macrocyclic biphytanyl glycerol diethers. However, compared with the macrocyclic diphytanyl glycerol diether with a molecular ion at m/z 722 (Comita et al. 1984 (Figure 3) . Therefore, it was hypothesized that the biphytanyl chains of A and B contain either one or two rings or double bonds, respectively. To eliminate one of these possibilities, the polar fraction was hydrogenated and reanalyzed by GC-MS. This experiment showed no changes in the molecular weight of compounds A and B, establishing the absence of double bonds within the biphytanyl skeleton. Consequently, it was concluded that A and B contain one and two rings, respectively. Archaeal core membrane lipids have been reported to contain a cyclopentane ring (De Rosa et al. 1983 , De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988 and, recently, a cyclohexane ring (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002a) in their biphytanyl moieties. The presence and location of one and two cyclopentane rings in the biphytanyl chains of A and B, respectively, is revealed by the distinctive fragment ion at m/z 165 present in both mass spectra (Figure 3) . The m/z 165 fragment corresponds to fragmentation associated with the cyclopentyl ring of biphytane derivatives (Schouten et al. 1998) . The position of the cyclopentane ring in biphytane moieties has been established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (De Rosa et al. 1977 , Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002b . The mass spectrum of B exhibits an enhanced fragment ion of m/z 165 compared with that of A, consistent with the presence of two cyclopentane rings. 168 STADNITSKAIA ET AL.

High performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry revealed that intact GDGTs in the TTR-11 BS-328G-2 carbonate crust are dominated by GDGTs containing zero to two cyclopentane rings (Compounds VIII, IX and X; Figure 4 ). This distribution has been reported previously in cold seep sediments and crusts of the Eastern Mediterranean (Pancost et al. 2001b , Aloisi et al. 2002 and in the anaerobic water column of the Black Sea (Schouten et al. 2001 , Wakeham et al. 2002 , where extensive AOM takes place. Crenarchaeol (Compound XII), the GDGT of ubiquitous planktonic crenarchaeota (Hoefs et al. 1997 , Schouten et al. 1998 , Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002a , is nearly absent, indicating only a minor contribution of pelagic archaeal lipids to the crust. Determination of the carbon isotopic composition of A and B gave δ 13 C values of -104 and -111‰, respectively. Archaeol and sn-3 hydroxyarchaeol are also characterized by extremely depleted δ 13 C values (-102 and -112‰, respectively). The δ 13 C values of non-isoprenoidal dialkyl diethers (Compounds I and II) are 10-20‰ heavier than A, B, archaeol and sn-3 hydroxyarchaeol. The carbon isotopic composition of Compound I is -95‰ and that of Compound II is -91‰. To the best of our knowledge, the macrocyclic biphytanyl glycerol diethers with one and two cyclopentane rings identified here have not been reported previously. Their molecular structure unites two characteristics reported for ecologically contrasting archaeal groups. The thermophilic methanogen Methanococcus jannaschii (Comita et al. 1984 ) is the only archaeon known to contain the macrocyclic diether as its core membrane lipid. On the other hand, cyclopentane-containing GDGTs are well known in (hyper)thermophilic crenarchaeota (Langworthy et al. 1982, De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988) , (hyper)thermophilic euryarchaeota Gambacorta 1988, De Rosa et al. 1991) , marine mesophilic crenarchaeota (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002a ) and mesophilic euryarchaeota capable of AOM (Pancost et al. 2001b , Aloisi et al. 2002 , but so far have not been detected in DGDs. This structural information leaves little doubt that the new lipids are derived from archaea. Since archaeal anaerobic methanotrophy results in highly 13 C-depleted lipids, we infer that membrane lipids A and B are derived from methanotrophic archaea. This inference is confirmed by the fact that these types of archaea biosynthesize structurally related GDGTs containing biphytane chains with one or two cyclopentane rings (Pancost et al. 2001b , Aloisi et al. 2002 , Wakeham et al. 2002 . It is unclear why some archaeal species capable of AOM present in the NIOZ mud volcano biosynthesize cyclopentane ring-containing DGDs instead of GDGTs. This may be related to adaptation of the physical properties of their cell membranes. It is, however, consistent with the observed archaeal diversity with respect to lipid composition in cold seep areas (Elvert et al. 2000 , Pancost et al. 2001b , Teske et al. 2002 . In any case, our data show that archaeal macrocyclic DGDs are not restricted to thermophilic methanogens but are also used by euryarchaeota involved in AOM. Two novel macrocyclic archaeal diether core membrane lipids containing cyclopentane rings were identified in a methanederived carbonate crust found in the NIOZ mud volcano in the Black Sea. The unprecedented molecular structure and isotopic composition of the novel glycerol diethers A and B reveal their biosynthesis by archaea performing anaerobic methanotrophy in cold-water environments. The identification of these biomarkers will enable better understanding of AOM-related microorganisms and their metabolic behavior. ",Alina Stadnitskaia,2003,15803662,10.1155/2003/329175
2216104,Methane-Carbon Flow into the Benthic Food Web at Cold Seeps – A Case Study from the Costa Rica Subduction Zone,"Cold seep ecosystems can support enormous biomasses of free-living and symbiotic chemoautotrophic organisms that get their energy from the oxidation of methane or sulfide. Most of this biomass derives from animals that are associated with bacterial symbionts, which are able to metabolize the chemical resources provided by the seeping fluids. Often these systems also harbor dense accumulations of non-symbiotic megafauna, which can be relevant in exporting chemosynthetically fixed carbon from seeps to the surrounding deep sea. Here we investigated the carbon sources of lithodid crabs (Paralomis sp.) feeding on thiotrophic bacterial mats at an active mud volcano at the Costa Rica subduction zone. To evaluate the dietary carbon source of the crabs, we compared the microbial community in stomach contents with surface sediments covered by microbial mats. The stomach content analyses revealed a dominance of epsilonproteobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences related to the free-living and epibiotic sulfur oxidiser Sulfurovum sp. We also found Sulfurovum sp. as well as members of the genera Arcobacter and Sulfurimonas in mat-covered surface sediments where Epsilonproteobacteria were highly abundant constituting 10% of total cells. Furthermore, we detected substantial amounts of bacterial fatty acids such as i-C15:0 and C17:1ω6c with stable carbon isotope compositions as low as −53‰ in the stomach and muscle tissue. These results indicate that the white microbial mats at Mound 12 are comprised of Epsilonproteobacteria and that microbial mat-derived carbon provides an important contribution to the crab's nutrition. In addition, our lipid analyses also suggest that the crabs feed on other 13C-depleted organic matter sources, possibly symbiotic megafauna as well as on photosynthetic carbon sources such as sedimentary detritus.","Most deep-sea ecosystems on Earth are considered to be energy limited, because they depend on a small fraction of photosynthetically produced organic carbon (C), which sinks from the productive ocean surface to the seafloor [1, 2] . They are contrasted by chemosynthetic ecosystems such as hydrothermal vents and seeps, which are fueled by chemical energy transported with subsurface fluids. Especially cold seeps, which form around mud, gas and oil escape structures and which are characterized by high methane effluxes [3, 4] , support high biomasses of deep-sea life, comprising chemosynthetic microbial mats and megafauna as well as associated heterotrophic animals [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The key biogeochemical process at cold seeps is the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulfate (AOM), which is a net conversion of methane and sulfate to carbon dioxide and sulfide [10] [11] [12] . The seeping sulfide fuels aerobic thiotrophic communities comprising free-living and symbiotic bacteria. The free-living thiotrophs often form dense microbial mats above gassy sediments [13] [14] [15] . Symbiotic megafauna such as bathymodiolin bivalves and siboglinid tubeworms host thiotrophic bacteria in specialized cells and tissues [7] . Oxidised cold seep surface sediments may also support free-living aerobic methanotrophs [16] [17] [18] [19] . These are not known to form dense mats at cold seeps, but they also occur as endosymbiotic associations with megafauna, such as bivalves and tubeworms [20] [21] [22] [23] . Furthermore, some highly adapted, hydrothermal vent or cold seep endemic annelids [24] , gastropods [25] and crustaceans [26, 27] farm chemosynthetic, microbial epibionts on their skin and shells, which they graze upon. An important question in the ecology of vent and seep ecosystems remains as to how chemosynthetically fixed carbon is transferred to the deep-sea food web [5, 9, [28] [29] [30] . Current knowledge is mostly based on measurements of the stable C isotope ratio of faunal bulk tissue [5, 9, 31, 32] . At cold seeps, both methane and its oxidation product CO 2 , are strongly depleted in 13 C [33] . Consequently, methanotrophic and thiotrophic bacteria, which incorporate 13 C-depleted methane and/or 13 CO 2 in their biomass are characterized by d 13 C-values much lower than 215 to 230%, which is the range typical for photosynthetically fixed C [33, 34] . Consumer species feeding on free living chemosynthetic bacteria or symbiotic fauna hosting these microbes in their tissue will also incorporate the 13 C-depleted C in their biomass [5, 35] . A valuable addition to the measurement of bulk tissue is the analysis of compound-specific d 13 C-values, for example of fatty acids (FAs), which are contained in cellular membranes [36, 37] . These lipids are incorporated from the food sometimes without significant alteration into the consumer biomass; e.g. essential fatty acids [38] . Furthermore, some lipids are diagnostic biomarkers because they are synthesized by specific source organisms. The analysis of their presence and specific C-isotope composition help to identify multiple dietary C-sources utilized by a consumer. However, the isotopic composition of biomass typically integrates over significant parts of an organism's lifetime. In order to investigate food sources that a consumer ingested only recently, the analyses of stomach content, including DNA, are frequently used in food web studies [39] [40] [41] . The aim of this study was to assess the importance of CH 4 -derived carbon for a dominant consumer -lithodid crabs -of the benthic food web at an active cold seep of the Costa Rica subduction zone. We combined bulk-and compound-specific stable C isotope analyses of muscle tissue and stomach contents as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization and screening for microbial 16S rRNA gene sequences to investigate the relevance of chemosynthetically-derived carbon for the crab's nutrition.  Mound 12 (Md. 12) is an active mud volcano located at the Central America convergent margin off the coast of Costa Rica at 1020 m water depth (8u 55.859 N, 84u 18.759 W; [42] ). It belongs to a series of cold seeps along the Costa Rican Pacific margin, which are related to the subduction of the Cocos plate and erosion of continental material, subsequent dehydration of subducted clay minerals as well as production of thermogenic CH 4 [43] [44] [45] . At Md. 12, CH 4 , geofluids and mud ascend to the seafloor along faults, which cut deeply through the basement and upper plate sediments [46] . Diapirism and mudflows have formed a roundish (,800 m diameter) cone-shaped relief (,30 m) with an irregular pinnacle in the NE and a lower profile ridge in the SW [42, 47] . The mudflows are intercalated with slope sediments, indicating that Md. 12 is frequently active, alternated by low-activity phases. At present, the mound seems to be most active at its pinnacle and the SW flank, which is characterized by dense microbial mats and other chemosynthetic organisms (mytilid mussels and Lamellibrachia tube worms) [47] [48] [49] . At a microbial mat site, we previously measured a total CH 4 flux of , 10 mol m 22 yr 21 of which only half was oxidized with SO 4 22 [47] . Indeed, bottom waters above Md. 12 were enriched in CH 4 with 1-2 orders of magnitude higher concentrations compared to background values, indicating that a significant fraction of the seeping CH 4 can escape into the water column [49] . We visited Md. 12 during two consecutive cruises with R/V Atlantis (AT11-28) and R/V Meteor (M66-2) in June and September 2005, respectively. Direct and/or video observations were carried out in June with DSV Alvin (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, USA) and in September with ROV Quest (Marum, Germany). In addition, we also photographed the sea floor during cruise M66-2 over a time period of 408 hours with a frequency of 2 pictures per hour. For this approach, a downward-facing digital still camera (Ocean Imaging Systems, North Falmouth, USA, 6.1 Mpix) was mounted on a lander frame (Deep-sea Observation System -DOS [48] ) resulting in a field of vision of 0.4 m 2 . The lander was deployed on top of a microbial mat (8u 55.699 N, 84u 18.789 W), which covered ,60% of the cameras field of vision. A specimen of the abundantly observed lithodid crab (see results and discussion section for a taxonomic assessment), which was apparently feeding on microbial mats, was sampled using DSV Alvin's manipulators (8u 55.729 N, 84u 18.839 W). The crab was stored in a basket until surfacing of the submersible and directly thereafter photographed and dissected. A tissue sample from a leg muscle and the stomach were removed and frozen at 220uC until further analyses in the home laboratory. A ,6 m wide sediment strip (8u 55.699 N, 84u 18.829 W) covered by the whitish, thiotrophic microbial mats as well as bare sediments 1-2 m adjacent to the microbial mat were sampled by push coring with ROV Quest. The lithodid crabs were taxonomically identified from photographs that we recorded in situ (i.e., with the deep-sea camera of the DOS lander; e.g. Fig. 1b) , and on board from the specimen recovered with Alvin (e.g. Fig. 1c, d ). Identification was based on morphological features such as spines, spinules and granules according to our previous work [50] . Extraction of lipids, separation and derivatization was carried out as described previously [51, 52] . Briefly, total lipid extracts (TLEs) were obtained from subsamples of the muscle tissue (,500 mg wet weight -ww.) and stomach (including its contents; ,400 mg ww.) by ultrasonication with organic solvent mixtures (methanol and dichloromethane) of decreasing polarity. The TLEs were then saponified and subsequently separated into fractions containing (i) fatty acids (FAs), (ii) hydrocarbons, (iii) ketons and (iv) alcohols (including glycerol ethers). FAs and alcohols were methylated prior to extraction using BF 3 in methanol and bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide (BSTFA) to form fatty acid methyl esters FAMES) and trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers, respectively. Separation of single lipid compounds, their identification, quantification and the determination of their stable carbon isotope composition was achieved by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to flame ionization detection (GC-FID), quadrupole mass spectrometry with electron ionization (GC-MS) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS), respectively [53] . Bulk stable carbon isotope composition was measured from CO 2 , released after flash combustion of ,100 mg (ww.) of muscle tissue in an automated elemental analyzer (Thermo Flash EA, 1112 Series) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan Deltaplus XP, Thermo Scientific). Determination of bulk C and N contents was carried out according to standard methods (www.geomar.de/en/research/ fb2/fb2-mg/benthic-biogeochemistry/mg-analytik/ determination-of-cns/). Briefly, all inorganic and organic C and N compounds in sediment samples were flash combusted in a CNS analyzer (Carlo Erba Instruments, LTD) and the resulting combustion gases were analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector yielding total C and N contents. Organic C was determined in a similar fashion subsequently to the removal of carbonate-bound C with HCl. C:N-ratios are reported as the molar ratio of organic C versus total N. Total DNA of the microbial community in the crab's stomach was extracted from ,350 mg (ww.) of stomach material using the FastDNA spin kit for soil (Q-Biogene, USA) as described elsewhere [53] . PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes, cloning, and sequencing was conducted according to [16] . For the construction of the epsilonproteobacterial clone library, a subsample of 50 ml of formaline-fixed sediment sample (the same sample as used for CARD-FISH, see next section) was centrifuged and the pellet was washed with 16 PBS and finally resuspended in 50 ml H 2 O. Subsequently, we sonicated the sample (2630 sec, 35 kHz) in a water bath sonicator. 1 ml of a 100-fold dilution was used as template for specific amplification of epsilonproteobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences using primers Epsi682F (59 TGTGTAGGGGTAAAATCCG 39)/GM4. The PCR conditions were as follows: 32 cycles, annealing temperature 44uC. Ten parallel PCRs of each sample were pooled, purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in 30 ml H 2 O. Cloning reactions were performed with the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) and inserts sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Sequences were checked for chimeras using the program UCHIME [54] and phylogenetically analyzed with the ARB software package using database SSURef_-SILVA_111 (July 2012, 739,633 sequences) downloaded from ARB SILVA resources [55] . The sequence data from the stomach sample will be published in the EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ nucleotide sequence databases under the accession numbers HE974888 to HE974904 as well as HF559372 and HF559373. Sequences from the epsilonproteobacterial clone library will be published under the accession numbers HG321355-HG321366. Sediment samples for CARD-FISH were fixed in formaldehyde solution, washed in PBS and stored at 220uC as described previously [16] . CARD-FISH was carried out on two parallel surface sediment samples (0-2 cm) from the microbial mat habitat and on one sediment sample from the adjacent, non-covered sediment as described previously [56] with the following modifications: Samples were sonicated before filtration (20 s an amplitude of 42 mm ,10 W; MS73 probe, Sonopuls HD70, Bandelin, Germany) and endogenous peroxidases were inactivated by incubation in 0.5% H 2 O 2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Cell walls were permeabilized with 10 mg ml 21 lysozyme in 16TE-buffer for 45 min at 37uC [57] . For the specific detection of Epsilonproteobacteria, we used the HRP-labeled probe Epsi682 (59-CGGATTTTACCCCTACACM-39; biomers.net) [58] applied at 20% formamide. Cells were stained with DAPI, embedded in mounting medium and counted under an epifluorescence microscope in 20-100 independent microscopic fields. Microbial turnover of CH 4 and SO 4 22 in sediments of Md. 12 was measured with radiotracer assays according to previously published works [51, 59, 60] . Briefly, CH 4 oxidation and sulfate reduction (SR) rates were determined from 6 push cores distributed over the ,6 m wide sediment strip covered with bacterial mats and from 3 push cores recovered 1-2 m away from this mat. Results and Discussion Sea floor habitat. We visited Md. 12 in 2005 and investigated the seafloor with DSV Alvin and ROV Quest. Visually, we could identify several habitats: reduced sediments covered by whitish microbial mats (e.g. Fig. 1a, b) and adjacent bare sediments without microbial mats (movie S1 in the supplements), colonies of bathymodiolin mussels (Bathymodiolus sp.) or siboglinid tubeworms (Lamellibrachia sp.) and CH 4 -derived carbonate pavements. As reported previously [47] [48] [49] , these habitats were distributed in a patchy fashion, interspersed by olive-green sediments. The size of the microbial mat patches varied from decimeters to several meters in diameter. The whitish color of the mats suggested that they consisted of thiotrophic bacteria, but the morphology of the mats differed in thickness and structure from those present at most known cold seep systems formed by large sulfur bacteria such as Beggiatoa, Thiomargarita or Thioploca [6, 15, 53, 61] . They resembled more the Arcobacter type mats known from mud volcanoes, such as of the Eastern Mediterranean [14, 62] . The sediments below the mats strongly smelled of sulfide, and previous measurements found ,15 mM sulfide in porewaters from this habitat [47] . All cores recovered from the microbial mats were also rich in CH 4 Lithodid crabs grazing on microbial mats. We frequently observed one type of lithodid crab, which dwelled and apparently fed on the microbial mats of Md. 12 ( Fig. 1 a-d, movie S1 ). Based on the shape of the carapace, rostrum and abdomen documented by high-resolution photography, we identified this species as Paralomis sp. [50] . Its morphology is similar to P. diomedeae, known to populate continental margins from Costa Rica to Peru, but it differs by the granules on the dorsal carapace surface and the armature of the chelipeds and walking legs. This suggests that the Paralomis type of Md. 12 could be a new Paralomis species, closely related to P. diomedeae. A conclusive determination of the crab's taxonomic status requires collection of new material and in-depth morphological and genetical investigations. We did not conduct off-site surveys during our sampling campaigns so that we can only speculate about the biogeography of the P. diomedeae related crabs and potential adaptations for the consumption of chemosynthtic biomass. Little is known about the ecology of P. diomedeae but the mouth parts (mandibles, maxillae, maxillulae and maxillipeds) of the previously examined specimens from the eastern Pacific Ocean off Costa Rica [50] and the ones of Md. 12 indicate that both are adapted to an omnivorous diet including detritus. Indeed, during submersible and ROV dives, we observed that the Paralomis sp. of Md. 12 grazed on the microbial mats (or on surface sediments including the mats) leaving clearly distinguishable feeding tracks of bare sediments behind (Fig. 1a, b) . Other members of the genus Paralomis, possibly opportunistic scavengers or predators, have also been observed at other cold seeps and hydrothermal vents constituting a potential link for the export of seep carbon to the surrounding deep sea [28, 63, 64] . However, to our knowledge, only one other publication has reported similar, direct observations from a cold seep setting, i.e. hermit crabs feeding on Beggiatoa mats at the Gullfaks seeps, North Sea [65] . The longer-term recordings of the lander-mounted still camera provided further evidence that the microbial mats apparently attracted Paralomis sp. (movie S1). During the 408 hours of observation with the landermounted camera, we counted 184 sightings of this crab species on a microbial mat patch while only 6 sightings were recorded from surrounding sediments (Tab. 1). Our observations, furthermore, indicate a pattern where intensive grazing was followed by a time period between 8 and 33.5 h of little or no grazing during which the mat regrew until it was grazed of again. We could also record the occurrence of a larger food fall, i.e. a Pyrosome (tunicate colony), which was also consumed by the Paralomis sp. (movie S1), confirming that they are opportunistic predators/scavengers. In addition to the P. diomedeae relative, we also noticed a second but rather rarely occurring Paralomis species (Fig. 2) , which we tentatively identified as P. papillata or a relative of this species [50] . However, the few available photo documents did not allow for a more reliable identification. One specimen of the so-called Yeti Crab (Kiwa puravida) could be seen once on the photo material of the lander mounted camera. We could not observe the P. ) during an observation period of 408 h. Note that we did not account for feeding tracks without a photo record of the originator and that single specimens could have been counted repeatedly. Org. C contents and C:N-ratios were averaged over the first 10 cm-and AOM and SR rates were integrated over the first 16 cm of surface sediment. Errors are presented as standard error. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0074894.t001 papillata relative or the Yeti Crab feeding on the mats but we noticed snails, which seemed to feed on the mats (movie S1). Sediment C and N contents. To investigate whether the P. diomedeae relative preferentially feeds on microbial mats compared to regular sediments as suggested by our observations, we compared the bulk chemical composition of surface sediments. Both habitat types were characterized by high contents of organic C (,2.5 weight%) and low C:N-ratios (,10, Tab. 1) throughout the upper 10 cm of surface sediments. These values are comparable to seafloor sediments from the highly productive upwelling regions of Peru [66] or Chile [67] at ,1000 m water depth and are indicative for a high fraction of fresh organic matter. This may be explained by the high pelagic primary production in the region of the Costa Rica Dome [68] . The organic deposits in sediments surrounding the seeps of Md. 12 could thus also serve as a relevant carbon source for the Paralomis sp. Nevertheless, the nutritional value of the microbial mat is probably higher than that of sediment detritus because of the low C:N-ratio of bacteria (typically 4-5), caused by a relatively high cellular protein content (,50%) [33] . As the bacterial mat was very thin, the rather coarse sediment sampling of 2 cm sections may thus have masked this signal. Besides the microbial mats and the sedimentary detritus, also the symbiotic megafauna at Md. 12 (i.e., Bathymodiolus sp. and Lamellibrachia sp.) could be an attractive food source for the crabs. Bivalves and annelids typically contain very high protein contents, which may comprise .70% of their organic matter [34] . However, we did not observe the crabs to feed on these potential food sources. To further investigate the dietary importance of chemosynthetic vs. photosynthetic carbon for the Paralomis sp. we analyzed the molecular signatures of stomach contents, muscle tissue and surface sediments covered by microbial mats (see next 2 sections). 16S rRNA gene libraries and FISH. CARD-FISH analyses of two parallel samples of the microbial mat and underlying sediments with the Epsilonproteobacteria-specific probe EPSI682 indicated that Epsilonproteobacteria constituted 9.5 and 11.1% of single cells. In contrast, in the surface layer of the adjacent, bare sea floor, we could only detect ,2% Epsilonproteobacteria. With respect to the morphological appearance of the mat, this confirmed dominance by Epsilonproteobacteria rather than by large gammaproteobacterial thiotrophs (Beggiatoa, Thiomargarita or Thioploca). We used probe EPSI682 as a specific forward primer together with the general bacterial primer GM4 in a PCR to resolve the diversity of CARD-FISH-detected Epsilonproteobacteria in the microbial mat habitat. Of the epsilonproteobacterial 16S rRNA genes (53 epsilonproteobacterial sequences from 72 clones analyzed in total, Tab. 2), six sequences grouped within the genus Sulfurovum. Other epsilonproteobacterial sequences belonged to the genera Arcobacter (25 sequences), Sulfurimonas (17 sequences), and Campylobacter (5 sequences). From the stomach contents, we could amplify bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences successfully but repeated attempts to amplify archaeal rRNA genes failed. This likely indicates a very low abundance of archaea in the stomach contents, which is in accordance with our biomarker analyses (see next section). From the amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes, we analyzed a total of 79 clones. We identified Epsilonproteobacteria of the genus Sulfurovum as the dominant bacterial group in the stomach of the Paralomis sp. (Tab. 3). Two groups (8 and 17 sequences, respectively) with a high intragroup sequence similarity of 98-99% and 94-95% between the two groups were detected. Sequences of cluster 1 were 99.8% similar to sequences from Eel River Basin methane seeps ( [69] e.g. acc.no.FJ264599) and those of the second cluster were 97.8% similar to a sequence obtained from particulate detritus from grabs of the vestimentiferan tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae (Forget & Jupiter, database release, acc.no. JN662293). Furthermore, sediment Sulfurovum sp. was highly similar to the Sulfurovum sp. cluster 1 found in the crab's stomach (96.8-99 .8% sequence similarity). Also gut and sediment Campylobacter spp. showed a high degree of similarity (up to 98.7%). Although Arcobacter-and Sulfurimonas-related sequences were not retrieved from the crab's stomach, these results provide evidence that Epsilonproteobacteria in the stomach originate from the thiotrophic mats, which the crab was observed to feed upon. Together with our observations of crabs feeding specifically on microbial mats, this strongly suggests that these mats are an important nutrition source for the P. diomedeae relative recovered from Md. 12. Epsilonproteobacteria are known from a variety of hydrothermal vents [70] but have also been found at cold seeps [19, 62, 69, 71] including brines [72, 73] . Members of the genus Sulfurovum have been found as free-living bacteria [74, 75] , episymbionts associated with a hydrothermal vent shrimp [70, 76] and with the cold seep associated Yeti Crab (Kiwa puravida), the latter of which was also found at Md. 12 [26] . Members of the Sulfurovum clade were also found in the gut system of the Yeti Crab and a hydrothermal vent shrimp [26, 77] . However, these Sulfurovum types shared only ,95% similarity with our sequences. The biogeochemical functioning of the Sulfurovum relatives constituting the microbial mats at Md. 12 is not clear. Known members of the genus Sulfurovum use elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as an electron donor, and nitrate or oxygen as electron acceptors [74, 78, 79] . Whole genome sequencing of a Sulfurovum strain (NBC37-1) revealed the presence of sox genes (coding for enzymes involved in sulfide oxidation) and the strain also had cytoplasmic and periplasmic sulfide-quinone oxidoreductases that oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur [80] . The stomach contents also contained sequences of other, seeprelated chemosynthetic microbes including aerobic organisms thriving in the upmost, oxic surface sediment layer as well as anaerobic strains from deeper sediment layers. We detected one sequence of a relative of Hypomicrobium and Acinetobacter, which were previously found to grow aerobically on chloro-or dichloromethane [81] and long-chain alkanes [82] , respectively. Among the anaerobic strains, we detected two deltaproteobacterial sequences belonging to relatives of the Desulfobulbus/Seep-SRB3 cluster, one sequence of the SEEP-SRB2 cluster, which comprise SRB associated to ANME archaea [10, 83] , and three sequences related to Desulfocapsa, which is a typical SRB in marine sediments, including cold seeps [16] . Furthermore, we also found other bacteria of unknown biogeochemical function that have regularly been found in anoxic cold seep sediments, i.e. relatives of the Candidate Division OD1 and Propionibacterium (of which we found six and two sequences, respectively) [11, 84, 85] . However, the relatively low abundance of sequences of anaerobic cold seep microbes indicates that the crab specimen analyzed here mostly fed on oxic surface-and ingested rather little amounts of reduced sediments containing AOM biomass, at least during its last feeding activities. The relatively deep position of the AOM horizon (,3 cm, Tab. 1) could make archaeal biomass rather inaccessible for the P. diomedeae relative or the expectedly high sulfide contents of the AOM horizon [47] could be too toxic. 25 out of 78 sequences were affiliated with Candidatus Lumbricincola and Candidatus Bacilloplasma, relatives that most likely belong to the gut flora of the Paralomis sp. Candidatus Lumbricincola has yet only been found in the gut systems of annelids [86] . Candidatus Bacilloplasma relatives, on the other hand, were found in the guts of decapod crustaceans (Scylla sp.; Sun & Li, database release acc.no. AY360354 and Nephrops norvegicus [87] ) isopods [88] and chordates (Wu & Wang, database release ac.no. GU293173). Members of the class Mollicutes are often pathogenic or parasitic, but also commensal and beneficial associations with their hosts have been found [41, 89] . Stable carbon isotope and lipid analyses. The bulk stable carbon isotope composition of the muscle tissue was 246% (Fig. 3 Table 3 . Bacterial 16S rRNA gene library obtained from the stomach sample of a lithodid crab (Paralomis diomedeae relative), which was observed feeding on surface sediments covered with whitish microbial mats. and thus extremely 13 C-depleted in comparison to organic matter in regular, recent marine sediments (210 to 235%), which are usually of photosynthetic origin (Calvin Benson Cycle) [33] . In eukaryotes, such negative carbon isotope signatures are typically attributed to a methanotrophic food chain [30, 36, [90] [91] [92] . However, also sulfate reducing bacteria and thiotrophs may show similar signatures by incorporating isotopically depleted CO 2 derived from methane oxidation and by further fractionation in autotrophic assimilation pathways [93, 94] . Together with our observations of the Paralomis sp. feeding habits and the presence of Sulfurovum sequences in the crab's stomach, the low d 13 C-value of the muscle sample thus strongly indicates that the Paralomis sp. derives a substantial fraction of organic carbon from the thiotrophic microbial mats, apparently over significant parts of the crab's lifetime. However, the bulk stable isotope composition may also comprise contribution from other chemosynthetic-and/ or phototrophic sources. To investigate the potential dietary carbon sources in more detail, we analyzed lipids from stomach contents (including the stomach epithelium) and from muscle tissue of a walking leg. Only trace amounts of the isoprenoidal glycerol ethers archaeol and sn2-hydroxyarchaeol, which are typical for AOM-mediating ANME archaea [95] were found in the stomach sample (data not shown). This directly implies that the stomach of the Paralomis sp. contained comparably little archaeal biomass, which is consistent with our 16s rRNA analyses (see above). Contrary to the archaeal compounds, we detected substantial amounts of FAs in both, the stomach and the muscle sample (Fig. 3, Tab. 4) . These lipids are of bacterial and/or eukaryotic origin. In the muscle sample, the FAs may originate from de novo synthesis, direct incorporation of food-derived compounds or a mix of both and can thus be used to trace chemosynthetic biomass in heterotrophs [37] . In the stomach sample, these lipids probably originate to a substantial degree from the crabs food source (however, note that the stomach sample contained not only stomach contents but also the stomach epithelium so that it comprises a mixed lipid signature of food and crab). The essential FAs C20:5v3, C20:4v6 constituted a major fraction of the analyzed FAs, in both samples (Fig. 3) . These lipids cannot be synthesized by the crab de novo [38] and are thus derived from the crab's food source. With respect to the depleted isotopic signatures of about 240 (C20:5v3) and 237% (C20:4v6), it is very likely that these compounds substantially originate from chemosynthetic bacterial biomass corroborating the molecular, and bulk stable isotope data. Moreover, the higher fractional abundance of C20:5v3 and C20:4v6 in the stomach-compared to the muscle sample indicates that these FAs were enriched in the stomach contents and thus originate from a recently ingested food source, possibly the microbial mats. Further evidence for the dietary importance of chemosynthetic biomass for the crab is provided by the presence of unusual, 13 C-depleted FAs in the stomach and the muscle sample (Fig. 3) , which contained substantial amounts of the iso-and anteiso-branched C15-C17 FAs, the moneonic FAs C16:1v5 and C17:1v6 as well as the cyclopropylic FA cyC17:0v5,6. Generally, these lipids are not found in crustaceans, but are representative of AOM-associated SRB and/or thiotrophic communities [17, 52, 95, 96] . Just as for the essential FAs C20:5v3, C20:4v6, the depleted stable carbon isotope signature of these compounds with values as low as 250.5 and 252.6% (C17:1v6) in the stomach and muscle sample, respectively, point to CH 4 -derived carbon as a dominant carbon source. In addition to microbial mat biomass, our lipid data provide evidence that the crabs utilize detrital material as well. A second essential FA, C22:6v3, had a much higher fractional abundance in Figure 3 . Fractional abundance and stable carbon isotope composition of fatty acids in a muscle-and a stomach sample of the Paralomis diomedeae relative. Note that the stomach sample contained stomach contents and stomach epithelium. The bulk stable carbon isotope composition of the muscle is indicated (grey horizontal line). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0074894.g003 the muscle tissue compared to the stomach sample (Fig. 3) , which suggests that this compound originates from food sources not present in the stomach at the time of sampling. The high dC 13 Cvalue of C22:6v3 (about 228%) indicates a photosynthetic origin of this FA. Most likely, the crab had consumed non-seep carbon during past feeding activities, for instance sedimented detrital organic matter, or food falls such as the Pyrosome colony (see movie S1). In comparison to the bulk stable carbon isotope composition of the muscle tissue (246%), the abundance-weighted, average FA d 13 C-value was considerably less depleted (236%, Tab. 4). Therefore, the crab specimen must have consumed additional 13 C-depleted compounds other than FAs. One such compound class are steroids, of which we found 13 C-depleted cholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3b-ol) and its probable precursor desmosterol (cholest-5,24-diene-3b-ol) (Tab. 4). Just as the essential FAs, decapod crustaceans appear to lack the ability to synthesize steroids de novo [97, 98] indicating a dietary origin of these compounds. Similar to the essential FA C22:6v3, we found a much higher fractional abundance of steroids in the muscle tissue compared to the stomach sample. One source of steroids could be infauna organisms such as polychaetes and nematodes, which, at other cold seeps, were found feeding on organic carbon from deeper sediment layers including the AOM horizon [5] . A second source of steroids could be symbiotic megafauna such as Bathymodiolus sp. and Lamellibrachia sp, which are also a potential food source for heterotrophic megafauna [36, 99] . We did not measure d 13 C-values of these organisms at Md. 12, but it is reasonable to assume that the bathymodiolin biomass is strongly 13 C-depleted just as has been found at other cold seeps [22, 90, 92] , so that Bathymodiolus sp. could be a source of the crab's 13 C-depleted steroid pool. Lamellibrachia sp., on the other hand, is often not 13 C-depleted [92, [100] [101] [102] . Nevertheless, a dietary mixture comprising symbiotic microbial mats, pelagic detritus and megafauna and/or infauna, probably accounts for the difference between bulk-and (abundance weighted) FA stable carbon isotope composition. Our sea floor observations together with the analyses of ribosomal RNA genes, lipid biomarkers and stable carbon isotope composition provides evidence that at Md. 12, the lithodid crabs closely related to Paralomis diomedeae feed on chemosynthetic biomass. This includes the Epsilonproteobacteria (Sulfurovum related spp., Arcobacter spp. and Sulfurimonas spp.), which form the thiotrophic microbial mats at Md. 12. Additionally, our analyses showed that other hydrocarbon degrading-and sulfate-reducing microbes as well as seep macro-and/or megafauna contribute to the nutrition of the crab. The stable carbon isotope-and lipid composition of the crab tissue confirmed that it is an opportunistic scavenger, using both, chemosynthetically as well as photosynthetically derived carbon in its diet. This agrees well with the shape of the crab's feeding appendages, which are functionally similar to other lithodid deep-sea crabs with an omnivorous diet (including detritus) and an opportunistic and vagrant life style. The results of this study suggest that cold seeps may have an important ecological role not only for seep-endemic but also for opportunistic, mobile megafauna. Movie S1 Time-lapse movie of sea floor observation recorded from a stationary, downward facing camera (2 pictures per hour, field of vision <0.4 m 2 ). Lithodid crabs (Paralomis diomedeae relative), which were apparently grazing on a thiotrophic, microbial mat were the most common observable fauna type (184 sightings during 408 hours total observation time).

25787557,"Microbiological investigation of methane- and hydrocarbon-discharging mud volcanoes in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania","Summary Paclele Mici is a terrestrial mud volcano field located in the Carpathian Mountains (Romania), where thermal alteration of sedimentary organic compounds leads to methane, higher hydrocarbons and other petroleum compounds that are continuously released into the environment. The hydrocarbons represent potential substrates for microorganisms. We studied lipid biomarkers, stable isotope ratios, the effect of substrate (methane, other organic compounds) addition and 16S rRNA genes to gain insights into the hitherto unknown microbial community at this site. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that bacteria were much more abundant than archaea. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA clone sequences indicated the presence of bacterial and archaeal lineages generally associated with the methane cycle (methanogens, aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs), the sulfur cycle (sulfate reducers), and groups linked to the anaerobic degradation of alkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons. The presence of sulfate reducers, methanogens and methanotrophs in this habitat was also confirmed by concurrent surveys of lipid biomarkers and their isotopic signatures. Incubation experiments with several common and complex substrates revealed the potential of the indigenous microbial community for sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and aerobic methanotrophy.

33792127,"Effect of high sedimentation rates on surface sediment dynamics and mangrove growth in the Porong River, Indonesia.","Large quantities of mud from the LUSI (Lumpur Sidoarjo) volcano in northeastern Java have been channeled to the sea causing high rates of sediment delivery to the mouth of the Porong River, which has a cover of natural and planted mangroves. This study investigated how the high rates of sediment delivery affected vertical accretion, surface elevation change and the growth of Avicennia sp., the dominant mangrove species in the region. During our observations in 2010-2011 (4-5years after the initial volcanic eruption), very high rates of sedimentation in the forests at the mouth of the river gave rise to high vertical accretion of over 10cmy(-1). The high sedimentation rates not only resulted in reduced growth of Avicennia sp. mangrove trees at the two study sites at the Porong River mouth, but also gave rise to high soil surface elevation gains.",N/A,Frida Sidik,2016,27048688,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.02.048
205788630,"Prokaryotic community structure and diversity in the sediments of an active submarine mud volcano (Kazan mud volcano, East Mediterranean Sea).","We investigated 16S rRNA gene diversity at a high sediment depth resolution (every 5 cm, top 30 cm) in an active site of the Kazan mud volcano, East Mediterranean Sea. A total of 242 archaeal and 374 bacterial clones were analysed, which were attributed to 38 and 205 unique phylotypes, respectively (> or = 98% similarity). Most of the archaeal phylotypes were related to ANME-1, -2 and -3 members originating from habitats where anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurs, although they occurred in sediment layers with no apparent AOM (below the sulphate depletion depth). Proteobacteria were the most abundant and diverse bacterial group, with the Gammaproteobacteria dominating in most sediment layers and these were related to phylotypes involved in methane cycling. The Deltaproteobacteria included several of the sulphate-reducers related to AOM. The rest of the bacterial phylotypes belonged to 15 known phyla and three unaffiliated groups, with representatives from similar habitats. Diversity index H was in the range 0.56-1.73 and 1.47-3.82 for Archaea and Bacteria, respectively, revealing different depth patterns for the two groups.

14676493,Diversity and Spatial Distribution of Prokaryotic Communities Along A Sediment Vertical Profile of A Deep-Sea Mud Volcano,"We investigated the top 30-cm sediment prokaryotic community structure in 5-cm spatial resolution, at an active site of the Amsterdam mud volcano, East Mediterranean Sea, based on the 16S rRNA gene diversity. A total of 339 and 526 sequences were retrieved, corresponding to 25 and 213 unique (≥98% similarity) phylotypes of Archaea and Bacteria, respectively, in all depths. The Shannon–Wiener diversity index H was higher for Bacteria (1.92–4.03) than for Archaea (0.99–1.91) and varied differently between the two groups. Archaea were dominated by anaerobic methanotrophs ANME-1, -2 and -3 groups and were related to phylotypes involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane from similar habitats. The much more complex Bacteria community consisted of 20 phylogenetic groups at the phylum/candidate division level. Proteobacteria, in particular δ-Proteobacteria, was the dominant group. In most sediment layers, the dominant phylotypes of both the Archaea and Bacteria communities were found in neighbouring layers, suggesting some overlap in species richness. The similarity of certain prokaryotic communities was also depicted by using four different similarity indices. The direct comparison of the retrieved phylotypes with those from the Kazan mud volcano of the same field revealed that 40.0% of the Archaea and 16.9% of the Bacteria phylotypes are common between the two systems. The majority of these phylotypes are closely related to phylotypes originating from other mud volcanoes, implying a degree of endemicity in these systems.",,Maria Pachiadaki,2011,21538105,10.1007/s00248-011-9855-2

215035312,Deep-biosphere methane production stimulated by geofluids in the Nankai accretionary complex,N/A,"In the lipid biomarker analysis of deep mud-volcano core samples, we detected H-shaped GDGTs (table  S7) ; these were also observed with one to three additional methyl groups in the isoprenoidal chain (cf. ref. 40) . The H-shaped GDGTs are diagnostic biomarkers for thermophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea, including methanogens (61), Thermococcales (62) and Thermoplasmatales (63), and have been exclusively detected in hydrothermal settings (40). The distribution of H-shaped GDGTs with dominant core and monoglycosidic species implies that these are fossil signals of thermophilic or hyperthermophilic archaea. Considering the fact that the concentrations of H-shaped GDGTs were relatively variable throughout the sediments, and the water in the original mud reservoir was mainly supplied from dehydration of clay minerals (that is, the smectite-illite reaction), detection of H-shaped GDGTs suggest that (hyper)thermophilic archaea may be present in the deeper and hotter realm of the old accretionary prism. Controversially, 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that most sequences were related to psychrophilic amd mesophilic members that have been often observed in cold to warm subseafloor sediments (Fig. 5, B and C) . This is consistent with these members being derived from mesophilic microbial communities inhabiting the original mud reservoir in the lower sedimentary basin, where the in situ temperature was expected to be 17°C to 30°C (see the main text). Nevertheless, among 436,687 sequence reads, we detected 48 sequences related to Aquificales (1 and 47 sequences from 104 and 119 mbsf, respectively), 3 sequences of Thermotogales at 119 mbsf, and 1 sequence of Thermales at 2.58 mbsf, which are very minor but presumably thermophilic or hyperthermophilic bacterial members based on the phylogenetic placement. We suggest that these signals are related to fossil or inactive thermophilic bacteria in the modern deep mud-volcano biosphere. We set up 240 culture vessels in total for cultivation of methanogens from the KMV#5 core samples: 6 sediment core samples, 2 types of media, 5 methanogenic substrates, 2 cultivation temperatures, duplicate for each substrate (see Supplementary Methods). Cell growth and methanogenesis were observed in only three cultures after 9 months of incubation. These three cultures were from Site C9005 sediment sample using the 1:10-diluted MJ medium (NaCl concentration: 3 g l -1 ). No enrichment cultures were obtained from Site C9004 sediment samples, even after 1 year of incubation. The methanogenic substrates of the enrichment cultures were H 2 /CO 2 , methanol and trimethylamine. Microscopic observation showed that the enrichment culture consisted of irregular coccoid-shaped cells that produced F 420 -like auto-fluorescence, indicating the growth of methanogens. All enrichment cultures were transferred to fresh medium with 10% (v/v) inoculation. Subsequently, only a H 2 /CO 2 -fed culture was successively transferred. To isolate the methanogen, a serial dilution technique was used in both liquid and solid media supplemented with H 2 /CO 2 as the sole energy source. Finally, we obtained a pure culture of methanogen, strain 1H1. Cells of strain 1H1 were non-motile, irregular cocci, 0.8-1.8 µm in diameter (fig. S7, A and B). Strain 1H1 utilizes H 2 /CO 2 , acetate, methanol, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine for growth and methanogenesis. The following substrates did not support growth and methane production: formate, dimethylsulfide, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, cyclopentanol, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol. Yeast extract and acetate were not required for growth. Strain 1H1 grew at temperatures of between 2°C and 50°C with optimum growth at 40°C ( fig. S7C ). Although the strain was cultured from the marine subsurface, it was found to preferentially grow under low NaCl concentrations (down to 0 g l -1 ) ( fig. S7D ). In addition, the strain had a wide range of NaCl concentrations at which it is capable of growth (NaCl concentration: 0-70 g l -1 ). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain 1H1 was affiliated with the genus Methanosarcina ( fig. S7 ). The sequence was identical with those of some Methanosarcina mazei strains. The strain has been deposited in the Japan Collection for Microorganisms (JCM 19936) . The calculation of mixing biogenic and thermogenic CH 4 at KMV#5 requires estimation of δ 13 C and δD of CH 4 and C 1 /C 2 ratio from biogenic and thermogenic end-members as inputs. We used previously reported data from nearby sites to constrain these inputs ( fig. S8A ). The assumed biogenic and thermogenic end-member values for the mixing calculations are shown in table S8. We estimated the δ 13 C CH4 value of the biogenic end-member using the average δ 13 C DIC below 5 mbsf at the KMV#5 measured in this study (+40‰) and the difference between δ 13 C CH4 and δ 13 C DIC (ε c ≈ δ 13 C DIC -δ 13 C CH4 , which is between 80‰ and 69‰) (14) in the active methanogenesis zone between the SMTZ (~2 mbsf) and ca. 80 mbsf at Sites C0001, C0002, C0004, and C0008 (55) (fig. S8B ). Our estimated δ 13 C CH4 of biogenic end-member is higher than typical biogenic CH 4 (< -60‰; ref. 12), because CH 4 at this site is inferred to derive from highly 13 C-enriched DIC (see main text). The C 1 /C 2 ratio of the biogenic end-member was estimated based on the average values in the active methanogenesis zone at Sites C0001, C0004, and C0008 (55) ( fig. S8C ). We assumed that the average C 1 /C 2 ratio (i.e., 3500) in the active methanogenesis zone at these sites is the most plausible biogenic end-member value, and the observed range of 2000-6200 is the possible range of the biogenic endmember. We assumed that the most plausible δD CH4 of biogenic end-member is -166‰ which is observed at the Kumano basin and the possible values are between -188‰ and -166‰ (44, 64). The δ 13 C CH4 and C 1 /C 2 ratio of thermogenic end-member is based on data from MITI Well off Tokai (65), Site 808 off Muroto (64), and Sagara oil field (66) (Fig. 4A and fig. S8A-C) . Although the referred sites are located far from each other and the source rock and thermal conditions are different, these data indicate that the δ 13 C CH4 values and C 1 /C 2 ratios of the thermogenic gases in the Nankai Trough area fall within a narrow range (δ 13 C CH4 : -45‰ to -40‰; C 1 /C 2 : 8 to 11). Therefore, we assumed that the δ 13 C CH4 value and C 1 /C 2 ratio of the thermogenic end-member falls within the range, and those of thermogenic gas below 2100 mbsf at the MITI Well (δ 13 C CH4 : -40‰; C 1 /C 2 : 8), which is the site closest to the Kumano basin, are most plausible values of the thermogenic end-member. In the Nankai Trough area, the δD of reliable thermogenic CH 4 has been measured only at Site 808 off Muroto (64). At Site 808, δD CH4 values of the thermogenic CH 4 below 1100 mbsf (>90°C) were -233‰ and -225‰. The δD values there are typical of CH 4 generated at an early stage of thermal maturity (13). For our mixing curves, we assumed that the possible range of δD CH4 of the thermogenic end-member is -229 to -138‰. The latter (maximum) value accounts for a possible contribution from higher-maturity gases. The lowest temperature for the production of thermogenic gas was assumed to be 80°C based on data from Site C0002 in the Kumano basin. At the IODP Site C0002, which was penetrated down to ~2 km below seafloor at 81-85°C, the mixed thermogenic gas at this horizon is delivered from deeper and thus hotter realms and no in situ production of thermogenic gas occurs (44). Therefore, we infer that the production of the thermogenic gas does not occur below 80°C. The maximum temperature was assumed to be ~220°C based on previous predictions, according to which the most gas is formed between 150°C and 220°C (67). 18 O and δD of hydrate water and known isotopic fractionation factors of oxygen and hydrogen in water between Structure I-gas hydrate and liquid water, which are 1.0024-1.0034 and 1.017-1.024, respectively (69). Using Raman spectroscopy, the formation structure of methane hydratechunks, which were obtained from 2.9 mbsf and immediately stored in a liquid N 2 tank onboard, was determined to be ""Structure I"" due to the C-H symmetric stretch of CH 4 corresponding to large and small cages ( fig. S1 ). The addition of 18 O-and D-enriched hydrate water by the dissociation of hydrates during core recovery and sampling should result in higher δ 18 O H2O and δD H2O values than the estimated δ 18 O and δD values of the original pore water. Based on the isotopic difference between pore water sample and original pore water, we determined the volume fraction between added gas hydratedissociated water and pore water M using the following equation where δ H2O and δ O represent measured values of δ 18 O or δD of pore water , and the isotopic compositions of original pore water before methane hydrate precipitation, respectively, and δ h represents δ 18 O of the hydrate sample. One mole of methane hydrate with the stoichiometric composition CH 4 ·5.75H 2 O (M = 119.5 g) contains 103.5 g of water, and has a density of 0.91 g cm -3 (70). Hence 103.5 cm 3 of hydrate-dissociated water is derived from 131.3 (= 119.5/0.91) cm 3 of gas hydrate. That is, one volume of pure water generates 1.27 volumes of gas hydrate. The gas hydrate saturation Sh is then calculated as follows Figure S4 , A and B show the vertical profiles of estimated methane hydrate-saturation in pore space. Because the estimated δ 18 O and δD values of original pore water vary from +4.3‰ to +5.3‰ and from -9.2‰ to -16.2‰, respectively, and given the range of reported isotopic fractionation factors of oxygen and hydrogen in water between Structure I-gas hydrate and liquid water (69), the estimates of methane hydrate-saturation are associated with 20-30% of relative uncertainty. When we adopted larger isotope fractionation to estimate δ 18 O and δD values of original pore water, the estimated methane hydrate-saturations sometimes resulted in negative values. The obtained sequence reads were processed as described elsewhere (56). All the sequence reads were processed using Pipeline Initial Process (http://pyro.cme.msu.edu/init/form.spr) with the following parameters: forward primer maximum edit distance, 2; maximum number of N = s, 0; minimum average exponential quality score, 20; reverse primer maximum edit distance, 0; and minimum sequence length, 150. For the classification and screening of the processed sequences, a BLAST+ analysis using the SILVA database (http://www.arb-silva.de) was conducted. The mothur software package (https://www.mothur.org) was used to remove chimeric sequences and to cluster the sequence reads into OTUs with a 97% sequence similarity threshold. Using the defined OTUs, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance of the microbial communities was calculated and average-linkage clustering analysis was conducted using the mothur package. Using the abundance of top 100 OTUs at different depths, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated. Network analysis and visualization was performed by Cytoscape version 3.2.0 using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient larger than 0.7. Using the environmental DNA extracted from the mud-volcano core samples as the PCR template, we tried to amplify methyl co-enzyme M reductase (mcrA) genes for methanogenic archaeal communities. We used general mcrA-targeting primers mcrIRD F and mcrIRD R (71). PCR mix consisted of 1 × MightyAmp buffer (Takara bio), 0.3 µM of each primer, 0.5 U of MightyAmp DNA polymerase, and 1.0 µl of the extracted DNA solution, in a 20-µl volume. After initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of PCR were carried out with denaturation at 98°C for 10 min, annealing at 56°C for 15 s, and elongation at 68°C for 30 s. Because no amplification products were obtained after the PCR, we tried to amplify the extracted DNA by multiple displacement amplification before PCR. We tried to amplify mcrA gene from the MDA product using the same PCR condition as described above. However, no PCR products of mcrA gene were obtained. To cultivate methanogens, we used six whole round core samples obtained from Hole A at Site C9004 and Hole E at Site C9005: samples from the sediment depths of 0. 66, 3.99, 12.10, 14.97, 18 .10 mbsf (Site C9004) and 12.82 mbsf (Site C9005 located in the upper southwestern slope of the KMV#5 [49] ). The sediment samples were collected from the innermost portion of the whole round core using a sterile tip-cut plastic syringe in a laminar flow clean bench onboard the Chikyu. The sediment samples were preserved in glass bottles under anaerobic condition, and the samples were stored at 4°C in the dark until experiments were performed. We prepared two types of media for enrichment of methanogens. The Se/W solution contained (l -1 ): 1 g Na 2 SeO 3 , and 0.5 g Na 2 WO 4 ·2H 2 O. The vitamin solution was composed of the following vitamins (l -1 ): 20 mg biotin, 20 mg folic acid, 100 mg pyridoxine·HCl, 50 mg thiamine·HCl, 50 mg riboflavin, 50 mg nicotinic acid, 50 mg DL-pantothenate (Ca salt), 1 mg vitamin B 12 , 50 mg p-aminobenzoic acid, and 50 mg lipoic acid. The second medium was 1:10-diluted MJS medium, but the medium contained the same amounts of NaHCO 3 , Na 2 S·9H 2 O, trace mineral solution, Se/W solution, vitamin solution and resazurin solution. The final pH value of the two media was 7.0 at 25°C. The following each of the methanogenic substrates were added to the medium as the sole energy source: H 2 /CO 2 (approximately 150 kPa in the head space), formate (20 mM), acetate (20 mM), methanol (10 mM), and trimethylamine (10 mM). Just before cultivation, the sediment samples were suspended with the anaerobic media and approximately 15 ml of the sediment slurry were inoculated into each enrichment culture medium bottle. Cultivations for the primary enrichment cultures were performed in 50-ml glass bottles containing 15 ml medium at 20°C and 55°C under anaerobic conditions. The primary enrichment cultures were set up in duplicate for each substrate. The serum vials were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp seals. Isolation of strain 1H1 from the enrichment cultures ( fig. S7 ) was conducted by serial dilution in liquid medium supplemented with a mixture of antibiotics (vancomycin and kanamycin, the concentration of each was 50 µg ml -1 ) and roll-tubes. After enrichment, all cultivations were performed using the MJS medium, in which the NaCl concentration was 3 g l -1 . Methane concentration was determined by gas chromatography (GC3200G, GL Science) with a thermal conductivity detector. Cell morphology was examined under a fluorescence microscope (BX51F; Olympus) with a color CCD camera system (DP72; Olympus). Growth and substrate utilization were determined from microscopic observation and production of methane. All incubations for the substrate utilization test were performed using exponentially growing cultures (10% inoculum, by volume) at 40°C for over 1 month. Effects of temperature and NaCl concentration on the growth of strain 1H1 were determined in H 2 /CO 2 -fed medium. The growth rates were calculated by measuring methane production. To evaluate the temperature range for growth, cultures were incubated at 2, 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 37, 40, 42, 45, 50 and 55°C (pH 7.0) . NaCl requirements were determined with varying concentrations of NaCl from 0 to 80 g l -1 in the basal medium. All incubations for these tests were performed in triplicate culture vessels for over 4 months incubation. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was determined according to a previous report (73). The 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic tree reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining method with Jukes-Cantor correction, implemented in the ARB program ( fig. S7E ) (74). To estimate the confidence of tree topologies, bootstrap-resampling analysis with 1000 replicates was performed for the neighbor-joining method by using MEGA program version 7 (75). The Δ 13 CH 3 D of a mixture depends on the Δ 13 CH 3 D of the end-members, as well as the δ 13 C and δD values of the end-members (25, 47, 76) . The Δ 13 CH 3 D of mixture with two-component mixing of endmembers (A and B) can be approximated as follows (47) Clumped isotope data, taken in combination with C 1 /C 2 ratios, have been used previously to estimate the relative amounts of biogenic and thermogenic gases (48). Assumptions must be made about the biogenic and thermogenic end-member values of δD and δ 13 C CH4 , and their clumped isotope temperatures. In our case, clumped isotope temperature of the biogenic end-member value is unknown. We constrain its plausible range as follows: Assuming two-end-member mixing between biogenic (δ 13 C: -39.5‰ to -29‰ [most plausible: -39.5‰]; δD: -188‰ to -166‰ [most plausible: -166‰] and thermogenic CH 4 (δ 13 C: -45‰ to -40‰ [most plausible -40‰]; δD: -229‰ to -138‰ [most plausible: -229‰]), we plot mixing curves between two end-members ( fig. S9 ). Each of the curves shown corresponds to a mixture that carries a 30°C Δ 13 CH 3 D temperature, but with a different proportion of biogenic CH 4 and/or different assumed Δ 13 CH 3 D temperature for the biogenic end-member. The diagram of mixing curves with various biogenic fractions constrains the fraction of biogenic CH 4 in the mud volcano samples to at least 70% of the total CH 4 . The calculated fraction of biogenic methane cannot be less than 70% unless the Δ 13 CH 3 D temperature of the biogenic end-member is <0°C, which is improbable for the sediment in the Kumano basin, or unless the Δ 13 CH 3 D temperature of thermogenic methane is <<150°C. The temperature at Site C9004 of KMV#5 was measured by using the APCT-3. The temperature was determined by extrapolation of thermal equilibrium during in situ temperature measurement for several minutes. The temperature profile at Site C0009 was calculated based on the heat flow in shallow sediment and the thermal conductivity at C0009 (77). Temperature at the décollement is estimated based on the thermal structure model of the Nankai subduction zone (78). ) communities. Spearman's correlation coefficient was determined to patterns of OTUs with 95% similarity cutoff. The significant correlations (p < 0.005) with coefficient (rho) greater than 0.7 or smaller than -0.7 were used for visualization by (44, 55, 64, 65, 66, 79) .

21653548,"Three species of Reteporella (Bryozoa: Cheilostomata) in a diapiric and mud volcano field of the Gulf of Cádiz, with the description of Reteporella victori n. sp.","Diapirs and mud volcanoes (MVs) are formed by the migration and extrusion of fluids and mud to the seafloor, respectively. In the Gulf of Cádiz there are ca. 60 MVs and several diapirs with different environmental conditions and seepage activity. Previous studies, mainly on MVs, have demonstrated that the invertebrate fauna associated with these seafloor structures can be very diverse, including chemosymbiotic species, mostly mollusks and frenulate polychaetes, as well as vulnerable suspension feeders, such as cold-water corals and sponges, among others. Previous studies of the bryozoan fauna in this area have recorded species belonging to 28 families. One of these families is Phidoloporidae, which comprises 27 genera worldwide, including the common Rhynchozoon, Reteporellina, and Reteporella. In the present study, two species belonging to Reteporella are redescribed, and a new species is described from diapirs and MVs on the shelf and slope of the Gulf of Cádiz. The samples were collected during several oceanographic expeditions carried out by the Instituto Español de Oceanografia. This genus is well represented in the NE Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, and our study extends its occurrence on MVs and diapirs fields of the Gulf of Cádiz.",N/A,LaÍs Ramalho,2018,29689781,10.11646/zootaxa.4375.1.4
215124414,The Microbiome and Occurrence of Methanotrophy in Carnivorous Sponges,N/A,"As shown by recent studies, filter-feeding sponges are known to host a wide variety of microorganisms. However, the microbial community of the non-filtering carnivorous sponges (Porifera, Cladorhizidae) has been the subject of less scrutiny. Here, we present the results from a comparative study of the methanotrophic carnivorous sponge Cladorhiza methanophila from a mud volcano-rich area at the Barbados Accretionary Prism, and five carnivorous species from the Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. Results from 16S rRNA microbiome data indicate the presence of a diverse assemblage of associated microorganisms in carnivorous sponges mainly from the Gamma-and Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriaceae, and Thaumarchaeota. While the abundance of particular groups varied throughout the dataset, we found interesting similarities to previous microbiome results from non-carnivorous deep sea sponges, suggesting that the carnivorous sponges share characteristics of a previously hypothesized putative deep-sea sponge microbial community. Chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis was confirmed for C. methanophila through a microbial community with a high abundance of Methylococcales and very light isotopic 13 δ C and 15 δ N ratios (−60 to −66 /3.5 to 5.2 ) compared to the other cladorhizid species (−22 to −24 /8.5 to 10.5 ). We provide evidence for the presence of putative sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria in the arctic cladorhizids; however, 13 δ C and 15 δ N signatures did not provide evidence for significant chemoautotrophic symbiosis in this case, and the slightly higher abundance of cladorhizids at the JMVF site compared to the nearby deep sea likely stem from an increased abundance of prey rather than a more direct vent association. The phylogenetic position of C. methanophila in relation to other carnivorous sponges was established using a three-gene phylogenetic analysis, and it was found to be closely related to other non-methanotrophic Cladorhiza species with a similar morphology included in the dataset, suggesting a recent origin for methanotrophy in this species. C. methanophila remains the only known carnivorous sponge with a strong, chemolithoautotrophic symbiont association, and methanotrophic symbiosis does not seem to be a widespread property within the Cladorhizidae. Sponges (Porifera) are among the earliest diverging animals and comprise one of the major animal phyla, with over 8,700 species currently described (van Soest et al., 2016) . They have been shown to often live in close association with abundant and highly diverse microbial communities, which can account for up to 35-40% of sponge biomass in some cases Hentschel et al., 2012) . Several studies, in recent years greatly facilitated by the use of next generation sequencing techniques, have identified an extraordinary diversity of microorganisms in sponges from all three domains of life. More than 30 bacterial phyla as well as archaeal and single-celled eukaryotes have been reported, including a candidate phylum, Poribacteria, which is known almost exclusively from sponges (Fieseler et al., 2004; Lafi et al., 2009; Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Within a single sponge, one may find hundreds to thousands of unique microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), some of which are common in marine environments, but many of which tend to be specific to a single host species or group of sponges (Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . The vast majority of sponges obtain nutrients by filtering water through an aquiferous system, and take up particles through choanocyte cells into the interior mesohyl of the sponge where digestion occurs. The mesohyl, an extracellular matrix making up the bulk of the sponge, is populated by motile sponge cells, and provides a habitat for the associated microbiome of the sponge (Bergquist, 1978; Taylor et al., 2007) . Microorganisms benefit from an increased access to nutrients, while in turn providing a variety of functions relating to the metabolism of the host sponge such as nitrogen cycling, carbon fixation, and the production of a vast array of secondary metabolites (e.g., Taylor et al., 2007; Hoffmann et al., 2009 ). Thus, a complete understanding of sponge function is incomplete without taking into account its microbial community, and a sponge could most accurately be considered as the sum of its host cells and associated microbiome. Carnivorous sponges, comprising family Cladorhizidae Dendy, 1922 (Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida) , are the only sponges known to have a partly or completely reduced aquiferous system. These sponges are instead able to capture and engulf prey such as small crustaceans and other planktonic organisms. Cladorhizids are usually erect, with a stalked, pennate, or branching morphology. Prey items become stuck to the adhesive surface and filamentous appendages of the sponge and motile cells migrate to and then envelop the prey, in effect creating a temporary digestive cavity around it (e.g., Kübler and Barthel, 1999; Vacelet and Duport, 2004; Vacelet, 2007) . Currently, around 150 species are recognized, belonging to the nine genera Abyssocladia Lévi, 1964 (around 20 spp.) , Asbestopluma Topsent, 1901 (around 30 spp.) , Cercicladia Ríos et al., 2011 (1 sp.) , Chondrocladia Thomson, 1873 (around 35 spp.) , Cladorhiza Sars, 1872 (around 35 spp.) , Euchelipluma Topsent, 1909 (around 5 spp.) , Koltunicladia Hestetun et al., 2016b (1 sp.) , Lollipocladia Vacelet, 2008 (1 sp.) , and Lycopodina Lundbeck, 1905 (around 25 spp.) (Hestetun et al., 2016b; van Soest et al., 2016) . A remnant aquiferous system is found in genus Chondrocladia, where it is used to inflate spherical swellings for use in prey capture and reproductive purposes rather than filter-feeding (Kübler and Barthel, 1999; Lee et al., 2012) , and other carnivorous sponges completely lack this structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate at least three bacterial morphotypes in the species Cladorhiza methanophila Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002 from a mud volcano at the base of the Barbados Accretionary Prism (BAP) Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002) , and reported TEM observations from the Pacific species Lycopodina occidentalis (Lambe, 1893) show that bacteriocytes are abundant in the mesohyl, especially in the filaments, in species without known chemoautotrophic symbionts as well (Riesgo et al., 2007) . However, the only known microbiome data currently available for carnivorous sponges is from Dupont et al. (2013 Dupont et al. ( , 2014 , who characterized the microbial community of L. hypogea Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 1996 from a Mediterranean cave. Carnivorous sponges are also of special interest due to the fact that methanotrophic bacteria have been reported in C. methanophila Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002) . In contrast to more well-known chemoautotrophic symbioses in groups such as polychaetes, bivalves or crustaceans (e.g., Felbeck, 1981; Childress et al., 1986; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009) , this is one of only a handful known or suspected vent or seep related chemoautotrophic symbioses within Porifera (Arellano et al., 2013) . Here, we present the results of a comparative study of the microbiomes of 11 specimens representing five cladorhizid species from the Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge including the genera Asbestopluma, Cladorhiza, and Lycopodina, and four specimens representing the species C. methanophila from the BAP, which is known to harbor methanotrophic symbionts. Our aims were to (1) provide additional data on the microbiome composition of carnivorous sponges and compare this to previous sponge microbiome studies, and (2) to compare the microbiome of a known methanotrophic carnivorous sponge to that of other, related carnivorous species and explore the extent of methanotrophy in the sampled species. In order to reach these aims, microbial community structures within sponge specimens were analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons with the Ion Torrent sequencing technology, using primers universal for Bacteria and Archaea, with subsequent amplicon taxonomic assignment and ecological analysis. The ratio of heavy isotopes of e.g., carbon and nitrogen is a common tool for studying food sources and trophic interactions. Very light isotopic ratios indicate organisms with prokaryote symbiosis (Childress et al., 1986; Fry, 2007) , and the microbiome data was supplemented with δ 13 C and δ 15 N stable isotope signatures in order to further investigate methanotrophic or other chemoautotrophic symbiosis in the sample material. Finally, the systematic position of C. methanophila was determined relative to the other carnivorous species based on a phylogenetic analysis also including other available cladorhizid sequences from GenBank. (Pedersen et al., 2010; Schander et al., 2010 ) (all other cladorhizids) (Figure 1) . The mud volcano field at the base of the BAP features massive methane emission from diapiric structures with associated seep fauna mostly belonging to bivalves with chemosynthetic symbionts in additions to large bush-like aggregations of C. methanophila (Olu et al., 1997) . Samples from the JMVF were taken mainly from the Troll Wall site (∼71.25 • N), a part of the rift valley close to Jan Mayen, with an additional specimen from an area of ultradiffuse venting in the rift valley characterized by biofilms dominated by Mariprofundus ferrooxydans (Pedersen et al., 2010) (Figure 2) . Cladorhizids are common in the vicinity of venting sites at the JMVF, but despite the presence of free-living chemoautotrophic microorganisms at these sites (e.g., Lanzén et al., 2011 ) the lack of any large aggregations of biomass like those found at the BAP, could indicate that cladorhizids here benefit more indirectly from the increased prey availability at these sites (Vacelet, 2006) rather than directly deriving nutrition from chemoautotrophic symbionts.   Specimens used for microbiome sequencing were collected primarily using the Bathysaurus ROV during the University of Bergen Centre for Geobiology (CGB) R/V ""G.O. Sars"" 2011 Sars"" , 2012 Sars"" , and 2014 cruises to the JMVF, and with the Jason ROV during the 2012 R/V ""Atlantis"" 21-02 cruise to the base of the BAP. Isotope sampling included additional specimens from CGB ""G.O. Sars"" 2008 Sars"" -2014 cruises. The majority of specimens were either preserved by snap-freezing samples in liquid nitrogen (LN2), or in RNAlater. RNAlater specimens were as a rule kept at normal freezer temperatures (−20 • C) during storage. We were also interested in seeing if a couple of ethanol preserved samples were viable for microbiome sequencing, and for some specimens, we ran parallels from part of the specimen fixed in 96% ethanol, and for two specimens, we sequenced from ethanol preserved material only. A list of cladorhizid specimens used for microbiome sequencing and host phylogenetic analysis is given in Table 1 . Specimens used for isotope analysis are listed together with the results of the analysis in Table 2 . Stable isotope analyses (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were conducted at the University of Bergen. Samples were dried at 80 • C for 24 h in glass vials and grounded to powder using a glass pestle. Lipids were removed by adding 7% methanol in dichloromethane for 2 h to the dried sample and then removed using a glass Pasteur pipette and again dried for 24 h at 80 • C. Inorganic carbon was removed by adding 0.5 M HCl to the samples. The time for the inorganic carbon to dissolve varied and the HCl was kept at minimum 5 min or until the reaction was finished. Acid waste was washed away by carefully adding and removing water to the sample until the pH reached 6-7. Finally the samples were dried and weighed in tin capsules and measured using a Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer connected to a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (Thermo Scientific). Isotope ratios are expressed in delta notation as difference in 13 C/ 12 C and 15 N/ 14 N isotope ratios compared to Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) and air N2, respectively. Samples were calibrated to internationally acknowledged C and N isotope ratio standards. Specimen subsamples were examined and visible contaminants removed and rinsed several times using Milli-Q water in a sterile environment. Extraction of grinded tissue was done using either the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA kit (Omega Biotek) or the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit. A water sample from the JMVF was filtered through a 0.22 µm cellulose filter that was cut into small pieces before extraction. Spicules were removed from the extract after lysis before adding ethanol. In order to establish the phylogenetic position of C. methanophila, partial ribosomal 28S rRNA, mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear gene asparagine-linked glycosylation protein 11 (ALG11) were sequenced to allow comparison with existing cladorhizid sequences in GenBank from Hestetun et al. (2016b) , which already includes other cladorhizids part of our study. A maximum likelihood analysis using RAxML 8.0.20 (Stamatakis, 2014) was performed on a concatenated dataset with the resulting ML most likely tree pictured with rapid bootstrap values (BS) indicated. Amplification procedure and analysis are identical to that of Hestetun et al. (2016b) , where they are described in further detail. For 16S rDNA sequencing, we targeted the V4-V5 regions using the universal prokaryote primers 519F (5 -CAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 ) (Øvreås et al., 1997) and 805R (5 -GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3 ) (Herlemann et al., 2011) . Ion Torrent libraries were constructed as described in detail in Jørgensen and Zhao (2016) . In short: all DNA extracts were PCR amplified in triplicates and subsequently pooled and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA was used in a second PCR in order to attach barcodes and adaptor sequence. Resulting amplicons were purified using AMPure XP bead Purification Kit (Agencourt), following the manufacturer's protocol, before all samples were pooled in equimolar concentrations (26 pmol). Prior to sequencing quantification was done using a Quantus Fluorometer. Amplicons were sequenced applying the Ion Torrent PGM Personal Genome Machine (PGM) platform technology (Life Technologies) with a 318 chip. The thermal PCR programs used were as follow: first round PCR: each reaction (20 µl) contained 10 µl 2x HotStarTaq R master mixture (Qiagen), 0.2 µl of each primer (100 µM stock), 2 µl template, and ddH 2 O. The PCR program was initiated with a hot start activation step for 15 min at 95 • C followed by 27 cycles of 95 • C for 30 s, 56 • C for 30 s, and 72 • C for 30 s. Second round PCR used same program but only seven cycles and contained in each reaction (25 µl) contained 12.5 µl 2x HotStarTaq R master mixture (Qiagen), 0.2 µl 806r-B-Key (100 µM stock), and 2 µl 519f MID primer (10 µM stock), with 5 µl of purified PCR products from first-round amplification as the template, according to the Ion Torrent protocol. Filtering (truncate length 200, max expected errors 0.5), chimera detection, removal of singletons, and OTU clustering (97% identity) were done using the UPARSE pipeline with USEARCH 8.1.1861 (Edgar, 2013) . Taxonomic assignment and phylogenetic tree construction was done with the Green Genes database v 13_8 using QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010) , and 16S rRNA amplicon data was submitted to the Sequence Read Archive as biosamples with accession numbers SAMN05722969 and SAMN05722971-SAMN05722981, under BioProject accession number PRJNA341449. Bray-Curtis pairwise dissimilarity index values, cluster and MDS analyses were calculated using R package vegan, and data were visualized using R packages ggplot2 and pheatmap. C. methanophila Sanger sequences for specimens J633-5 (Cmet1) and J636-3 (Cmet4) were uploaded to GenBank with accession numbers KX815331-KX815335.  Stable isotope analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N was done on 15 samples representing five cladorhizid species (Figure 3 ; Table 2 ). The results show that all JMVF cladorhizids had isotope ratios within a quite narrow range of around −22 to −24 for δ 13 C and 8.5 to 10.5 for δ 15 N. The BAP C. methanophila specimens were found to have very light δ 13 C and δ 15 N ratios of around −60 to −66 for δ 13 C and 3.5 to 5.2 for δ 15 N, clearly separating it from the other cladorhizid specimens (Mann-Whitney rank-sum p-value = 0.001465). The Cladorhizidae phylogenetic analysis recovered the two sequenced C. methanophila specimens as a close sister taxon to C. gelida with high support (BS = 100). C. gelida is a common Cladorhiza species with a wide biogeographical distribution and eurybathyal depth range, and is also included in the microbiome dataset here. Other North Atlantic arbuscular Cladorhiza species (C. abyssicola Sars, 1872, C. oxeata Lundbeck, 1905 , C. corticocancellata Carter, 1876 , and C. tenuisigma Lundbeck, 1905 were also recovered as close relatives within the genus (Figure 4) .  We obtained 16S rRNA sequences from 20 samples representing 11 specimens and one water sample. Filtering removed 36.6% of initial unfiltered reads, and the total number of filtered reads was 2,067,945, with individual run ID reads ranging between 25,987 Individual specimens are referred to by sample ID throughout the text. * These specimens were also used in the phylogenetic analysis in this study. Specimens were collected from the JMVF except C. methanophila specimens, which were collected at the base of the BAP. Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org and 207,572. Total number of unique reads was 349,835. Filtered reads were clustered into 2,005 OTUs using a 97% identity threshold ( Table 3) . Multiple replicates from the same specimen were pooled together in subsequent analyses. In order to mitigate biases from variable sequencing depth, pooled samples were subsampled to a standard depth of 45,000 reads for all subsequent analyses (smallest pooled sample was ∼49,000 reads). Checking for any systematic bias in taxonomic assignments due to extraction kit, we did not see any consistent difference between samples extracted with the Qiagen kit (Afur1 1-3, Afur2, Caby1, Ccor1, Cgel1, Cgel2 2-13, Cmet4 2-8) and the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc kit (Afur1 1-2; Cgel2 2-11 and 2-12; all Cmet1, Cmet2, and Cmet3; Cmet4 2-7; Lcup1; Wat1) ( Figure 5) . Looking at the viability of EtOH as fixative (in this particular case, with comparatively fresh specimens kept in cold storage) for samples Caby1, Ccor1, Cgel2 2-11, Cmet1 2-1, and Cmet2 2-4, we found no difference for the Cmet samples, but samples Caby1, Ccor1, and Cgel2 showed a comparatively large abundance of Thiohalorhabdales (Gammaproteobacteria) compared to other samples (and replicates in the case of Cgel2) (Figure 5) . While the variable abundance of Thiohalorhabdales is consistent with earlier results showing that prokaryote concentration is variable throughout the sponge (see section ""Comparison with Other Sponge Microbiomes""), and could thus be attributable to sampling location as the Thiohalorhabdales abundance is also variable for the two non-EtOH replicates of Cgel2, it is also possible that the EtOH fixative has influenced relative abundance for these three samples, which has been taken into account in the relevant discussion. At the phylum level, 97% OTUs were classified into 41 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla, with between 15 and 36 phyla for individual FIGURE 4 | A maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of the carnivorous sponge family Cladorhizidae based on a concatenated dataset of partial 28S rDNA, COI and ALG11 (2859 bp), showing the position of C. methanophila (bold).

The tree is rooted using the non-carnivorous sponge Guitarra antarctica (Guitarridae). Genera except Cladorhiza are collapsed.

The most common prokaryotes at class level are given in Figure 6 . The 10 most common groups at genus level are given in table form in Table 4 , and a heatmap showing overlap in identity between specimens at genus level is given in Figure 7 . Carnivorous sponge samples were dominated by a combination of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and Thaumarchaeota. The JMVF water sample also included smaller amounts of additional phyla including Verrucomicrobia, Tenericutes, SAR406, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Euryarchaeota. At the class level, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class in Asbestopluma (Asbestopluma) furcata and C. methanophila. It also completely dominated the C. abyssicola and C. corticocancellata samples, while other Cladorhiza samples were more mixed. Alphaproteobacteria were also present in all samples, and had a large presence in some Cladorhiza samples and L. cupressiformis. Flavobacteriia were most abundant in L. cupressiformis, and were also present in other samples to varying degrees. Within the Gammaproteobacteria, an unknown genus and family of Thiohalorhabdales was present in all cladorhizid samples. The abundance varied greatly between samples: While the C. abyssicola and C. corticocancellata samples had over 90% reads from this group (but see caveat regarding sample fixation, section ""Run Statistics""), other samples averaged 30% (C. gelida specimen 2), ∼10-20% (A. furcata) or less than 10% for the rest of the samples. The order Oceanospirillales, was prominent in several samples, most significantly in the two A. furcata specimens (57.7 and 65.8%), and to a lesser degree in C. methanophila (∼15-25%) and L. cupressiformis (6.0%), but absent in other Cladorhiza samples. Most of the Oceanospirillales reads were associated with the SUP05 clade, but two other groups were present in smaller quantities as well. The obligate methanotrophic order Methylococcales (Bowman, 2005) was present in C. methanophila only, where it was one of the major groups in terms of abundance (16-25%). Another group found almost exclusively in C. methanophila was the order Thiotrichales (5-10%). The Alphaproteobacteria were mainly represented by Rhodobacterales, especially Octadecabacter, which was present in large quantities in C. gelida (20-40%), in lesser quantities in C. methanophila (3.9-6.0%) and L. cupressiformis (7.7%) and Multiple samples from the same specimen are indicated with specimen numbering and color. Run ID comprises run (1 or 2) and MID. Unique OTUs are with singletons and chimeras removed. Statistics for aggregated run lists unique reads, singletons and unique OTUs across the entire dataset. Samples from the same specimen were pooled together, and sequencing depth standardized to 45000 reads, for subsequent analyses. almost absent in A. furcata, C. abyssicola, and C. corticocancellata (0-1.2%). Another unknown Rhodobacteraceae was present in slightly lower overall quantities: 17.3% in L. cupressiformis, 5-10% in C. gelida and low amounts in other samples (0-1.5%). The main part of Flavobacteriia reads were identified as Polaribacter with 35.6% abundance in L. cupressiformis, over 20% abundance in C. methanophila and C. gelida, and lower values in the range of 2.6-7.4% for A. furcata, C. abyssicola,  Values 5% and above in bold. and C. corticocancellata. A second group of Flavobacteriaceae was also present in the case of L. cupressiformis (16.2%), making the total for Flavobacteriaceae over 50% in this specimen. The only archaeal group found in any significant amount was Nitrosopumilus from the Thaumarchaeota Marine Group 1, which was found in moderate amounts (16-22%) in C. gelida and low amounts (0-2.4%) in other samples. Bray-Curtis normalized distances were calculated between specimens on the subsampled microbiome abundance dataset in order to identify systematic differences in microbiome composition. The Bray-Curtis distances were used to perform a hierarchical average linking clustering and NMDS analyses at the 97% OTU level (Figure 8) . The cluster analysis recovered the water sample in a root position with one clade of C. methanophila, L. cupressiformis, and C. gelida and one clade of C. abyssicola, C. corticocancellata, and A. furcata. However, results show small Bray-Curtis distances (0.7-0.9) between these clades. The NMDS analysis recovered the water sample some distance away from the cladorhizid samples, which broadly cluster in one clade containing C. gelida and C. methanophila, and one clade containing C. abyssicola, C. corticocancellata, and A. furcata.  Our results represent the first comparative study of microbiome composition in carnivorous sponges, expanding on the results of the single-species carnivorous sponge study by Dupont et al. (2013) as well as providing a reference for comparison against larger studies of non-carnivorous sponges like Thomas et al. (2016) and deep-sea sponges such as Kennedy et al. (2014) . The class level microbiome community structures observed in this study are similar to previously published filter-feeding sponge microbiomes, with a dominance of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Other major groups in our study are Bacteroidetes and Thaumarchaeota, and Bacteroidetes was found to be the dominating group in L. cupressiformis (Figure 6) . Thaumarchaeota are often found as a secondary group in several studies Thomas et al., 2016) . Reports of Bacteroidetes are less common, but have been reported for deep-sea sponges (Kennedy et al., 2014) , including the previously sequenced microbiome of the carnivorous sponge L. hypogea (Dupont et al., 2013) . At higher taxonomic resolution (family and genus level), large variation in the different species microbiomes is evident (Figure 7) . This is consistent with previous surveys reporting on high degrees of host specificity among sponge microbiomes (Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Moreover, some of the results from sequencing multiple replicates from the same specimen ( Figure 5) show considerable variation also within each sample, especially for Thiohalorhabdales. While it is possible that the fixative has partly influenced the results in this particular case here (see section ""Run Statistics""), the results are in accordance with an uneven distribution of microbial organisms within the host sponges, as previously reported through TEM observations by Riesgo et al. (2007) . Interestingly, an unknown Thiohalorhabdales, and Oceanospirillales, both from the SUP05 clade as well as others, were abundant across all species in the dataset (Figure 7 ; Table 4 ). The only described species of Thiohalorhabdales is Thiohalorhabdus denitrificans, an obligate chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium from hypersaline habitats (Sorokin et al., 2008) . Thiohalorhabdales have been reported in low concentrations from sea water with abundance correlated with nitrite concentration (Frank et al., 2016) . The Oceanospirillales SUP05 group is also associated with sulfur oxidation, partly at vent and seep sites (Anantharaman et al., 2013) . It has been reported both as free-living bacteria and as an endosymbiont (Marshall and Morris, 2013) . We found small to moderate amounts of Thaumarchaeota Marine Group 1 reads belonging to Nitrosopumilus in parts of our dataset (Figure 7; Table 4) , mainly in the case of C. gelida. This group was also found in moderate quantities in the JMVF water sample. Members of Nitrosopumilus are common in seawater and grow by oxidizing ammonium to nitrite (Könneke et al., 2005) . Interestingly, sponge symbiont archaeal nitrification has been reported from several studies (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Radax et al., 2012) , and Nitrosopumilus was also found to be the dominating archaeon in part of the specimens in the deep-sea sponges in Kennedy et al. (2014) , implying a possible role for this group within carnivorous sponges. Sulfur-and ammonia-oxidizing symbionts seem to be common in non-carnivorous deep-sea sponges (Nishijima et al., 2010; Arellano et al., 2013) , implying that chemolithoautotrophy could be a widespread supplementary source of nutrition for deep-sea sponges in general (Kennedy et al., 2014) . Though the taxonomic affinity of the major putative sulfur-oxidizing groups in our dataset (Thiohalorhabdales, Oceanospirillales) were partly different than that of Kennedy et al. (2014) (chiefly Chromatiales, but also some Oceanospirillales and others), this raises the possibility that partial nutrient acquisition from sulfur oxidation could be common in carnivorous sponges as well, though as evidenced by the isotope signatures from our study (Figure 3 ) such activity would be a supplement to carnivory rather than the major mode of nutrition. Other significant groups present in the dataset were identified as associated with several marine bacterial taxa: For the Alphaproteobacteria, the two major OTUs were somewhat evenly split between an unknown Rhodobacteraceae and the marine genus Octadecabacter. The Bacteroidetes were, excepting an unknown Flavobacteriaceae in L. cupressiformis, almost exclusively Polaribacter, a genus containing several gas vacuolated, marine bacterial species (Gosink et al., 1998) (Figure 7 ; Table 4 ). (For Methylococcales, see section ""Trophic Considerations and Extent of Methanotrophy in Carnivorous Sponges""). The habit of C. methanophila is arbuscular, with a great number of filaments extending in all directions from the branches. Together with the types and sizes of its skeletal spicules, the morphology is similar to and suggests a close affinity to a group of Cladorhiza species from the North Atlantic. This group includes the three species C. abyssicola (type species of the genus), C. corticocancellata and C. gelida, also examined here, as well as C. iniquidentata Lundbeck (1905) , C. oxeata, and C. tenuisigma (Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002; Hestetun et al., in press ). The phylogenetic relationships and systematic classification of the carnivorous sponges were investigated in a recent study (Hestetun et al., 2016b) , which included most of the North Atlantic cladorhizid species, and sequences from that study were used here with the addition of C. methanophila in order to recover its phylogenetic position. In view of the morphological similarities, the recovery of C. methanophila as a close sister taxon to the other arbuscular North Atlantic Cladorhiza species in the dataset (Figure 4) is not very surprising. C. methanophila has also been reported from the 15 • 20 N fracture zone segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hestetun et al., 2015) , and has a known depth range of 2600-4900 m. Most other arbuscular Cladorhiza species have a somewhat shallower distribution (mainly 200-2000 m), but the closest sister taxon, C. gelida, has a eurybathyal range, reported from 500 to 3500 m (Hestetun et al., in press) . Given the lack of any evidence of methanotrophic symbiosis in other closely related cladorhizids in the dataset here, a likely hypothesis is that methanotrophy in C. methanophila is a rather recent event, possibly occurring as an adaptation to a vent or seep locality either at the BAP or the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As deep-sea sponges, cladorhizids are often found in greater concentrations in the enrichment zones surrounding vent and seep systems, where prey is comparatively abundant. However, the large size and great abundance of the shrub-like aggregations of C. methanophila at the BAP greatly exceeds normal concentrations of carnivorous sponges, even at other vent sites. Though captured prey items show that C. methanophila still retains the ability to acquire nutrients through prey capture (Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002) , this suggests that this sponge is able to derive a large amount of nutrients from its chemoautotrophic association Olu et al., 1997 ) (compare Figure 2 for a visual impression) . Results showed that an undescribed Methylococcales OTU was recovered in large abundance from C. methanophila specimens, supporting earlier findings describing symbiosis between this species and methanotrophic symbionts. The isotope results, in particular the very light δ 13 C ratios of −60.5 to −66.0 , are very strong indicators of a symbiotic origin for organic carbon in the host sponge, and consistent with δ 13 C ratios reported in other symbioses from e.g., Gulf of Mexico vent (−51 to −57 ) (Childress et al., 1986) and seep (−74 ) (Cavanaugh et al., 1987) (−45.4 to −39.6 and −68.4 to −78.8 ) (MacAvoy et al., 2002) mussels. Surprisingly, they are also lighter than ratios reported for C. methanophila from the BAP by (−48.4 to −48.8 ), which could be related to changes in source carbon signature or precise sampling location. The high sponge concentrations at the BAP, previous TEM and isotope values (e.g., , and microbiome and isotope results from our study (Figure 3; Table 2 ), clearly show that this species obtains a majority of nutrients from its symbiont relationship rather than through prey capture. The only other sponge where methanotrophic symbiosis has been reported is Myxilla (Ectyomyxilla) methanophila Maldonado and Young (1998) . However, here the dominating methanotroph is Methylohalomonas (Chromatiales, Ectothiorhodospiraceae) (Arellano et al., 2013) . In contrast to C. methanophila, close relatives including C. abyssicola, C. corticocancellata, and C. gelida, did not have isotopic ratios suggesting a large contribution from chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis (Figure 3 ) (see Sweetman et al., 2013 for other JMVF biota). Gammaproteobacteria in groups related to known sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were prominent in the microbiome across different cladorhizids in this study. Hydrogen sulfide is present in high concentrations in the high-temperature fluids venting from white smokers at the Troll Wall site at the JMVF (Baumberger, 2011; Dahle et al., 2015) . However, sulfur oxidation, which seems to be a common feature in deepsea sponges, may, if indeed it signifies chemolithoautotrophy, account for a smaller portion of the nutrient uptake than the methanotrophic symbiosis in C. methanophila. Thus, chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis as a dominant form of nutrient acquisition within carnivorous sponges seems to be an isolated case rather than a more widespread phenomenon in currently reported species. Taken together, the microbiome structures seen in our dataset show a similar dominance of Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria as that reported for filter-feeding sponges, with some deviation in less dominant groups such as Bacteroidetes and Thaumarchaeota. However, more interestingly, they display marked functional similarities to the results of the filter-feeding (i.e., noncarnivorous) deep-sea sponge species examined by Kennedy et al. (2014) at a higher resolution, sharing ammonia-oxidizing taxa (Nitrosopumilus) and both having significant abundances of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Thus, it seems that carnivorous sponges overlap with other deep-sea filter-feeding sponges in the functional properties of major groups of their microbiome, though the lack of other comparative data makes it difficult to ascertain whether these taxonomic differences represent a carnivorous sponge-specific microbiome. The phylogenetic analysis shows that C. methanophila is a close relative of other North-Atlantic Cladorhiza species. While it is difficult to assess the importance of sulfur and ammonia oxidation in the metabolism of carnivorous sponges in general from the data presented here, the large quantities of methanotrophic symbiont bacteria and low isotopic signature of C. methanophila are clear indications that this species relies to a large degree on its chemoautotrophic symbionts, an association that seems to have evolved in this species as a special case rather than in a larger number of related carnivorous sponges.

10758220,Microbiological Processes of the Carbon and Sulfur Cycles at Cold Methane Seeps of the North Atlantic,"Functioning of microbial communities in surface sediments of the Haakon Mosby underwater mud volcano (lat. 72 degrees N) and in gas seepage fields of the Vestnesa Ridge was investigated using Mir-1 and Mir-2 deep-sea submersibles during the 40th expedition of the research vessel Academician Mstislav Keldysh. Large areas of sedimentary deposits of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) and pockmarks of the Vestnesa Ridge (VR) are covered with bacterial mats 0.1 to 0.5 cm thick. The microbial community making up bacterial mats of the HMMV was predominated by large filamentous bacteria with filaments measuring up to 100 microns in length and 2 to 8 microns in width. The occurrence of rosettes allowed the observed filamentous bacteria to be referred to the morphologically similar genera Leucothrix or Thiothrix. Three morphological types of filamentous bacteria were identified in bacterial mats covering VR pockmarks. Filaments of type one are morphologically similar with representatives of the genera Thioploca or Desmanthos. Type two filaments had numerous inclusions of sulfur and resembled representatives of the genus Thiothrix. The third morphological type was constituted by single filaments made up of tightly connected disk-like cells and can, apparently, be assigned to the genus Beggiatoa. The rates of methane oxidation (up to 1570 microliters C/(dm3 day)) and sulfate reduction (up to 17 mg S/(dm3 day)) measured in surface sediments of HMMV and VR were close to the maximum rates of these processes observed in badly polluted regions of the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea. High rates of microbiological processes correlated with the high number of bacteria. The rate of methane production in sediments studied was notably lower and ranged from 0.1 to 3.5 microliters CH4/(dm3 day). Large areas of the HMMV caldera were populated by pogonophoras, represented by the two species, Sclerolinum sp. and Oligobrachia sp. The mass development of Sclerolinum sp. in the HMMV caldera was by the activity of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria localized inside the cells of these animals. Bacterial cells were also found in the trophosome tissue of Oligobrachia sp., but in cells of these bacteria, we did not observe the membrane structures typical of methanotrophs. The localization pattern of pogonophoras on the surface of reduced sediments suggests that the predominant bacteria in Oligobrachia tissues are sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts.",,N.

2118101,Unsupervised discovery of microbial population structure within metagenomes using nucleotide base composition,"An approach to infer the unknown microbial population structure within a metagenome is to cluster nucleotide sequences based on common patterns in base composition, otherwise referred to as binning. When functional roles are assigned to the identified populations, a deeper understanding of microbial communities can be attained, more so than gene-centric approaches that explore overall functionality. In this study, we propose an unsupervised, model-based binning method with two clustering tiers, which uses a novel transformation of the oligonucleotide frequency-derived error gradient and GC content to generate coarse groups at the first tier of clustering; and tetranucleotide frequency to refine these groups at the secondary clustering tier. The proposed method has a demonstrated improvement over PhyloPythia, S-GSOM, TACOA and TaxSOM on all three benchmarks that were used for evaluation in this study. The proposed method is then applied to a pyrosequenced metagenomic library of mud volcano sediment sampled in southwestern Taiwan, with the inferred population structure validated against complementary sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA marker genes. Finally, the proposed method was further validated against four publicly available metagenomes, including a highly complex Antarctic whale-fall bone sample, which was previously assumed to be too complex for binning prior to functional analysis.","where N s is the total number of samples. Regressing the E i terms over the set of l i , ∀i ∈ 1 . . . G, where G is the number of discrete subsample lengths, gives the linear trend of the compositional error over subsample length: The quantity G can be defined in terms of step-size between subsequent subsample lengths and N s can be defined in terms of the fold-coverage of the original sequence. In this study G = 0.1 × L and N s = 3 × L. Further work on OFDEG has shown its validity and given an insight into its theoretical underpinnings (Maheswararajah S, Saeed I and Halgamuge SK, Internal Report, 2011)  The dinucleotide odds ratio [2] is given by: where f (n 1 n 2 ) is the frequency of the dinucleotide n 1 n 2 , and f (n 1 ) and f (n 2 ) are the mononucleotide frequencies of nucleotides n 1 and n 2 . Tetranucleotide frequency is the most widely adopted feature for clustering metagenomic sequences. The maximal-order Markov normalisation [3] for a given sequence is given by: f (n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 )f (n 2 n 3 ) f (n 1 n 2 n 3 )f (n 2 n 3 n 4 ) . Given the maximal order Markov model from the dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequency components, the z-score transform is used to assess the statistical significance of each tetramer [4] . The mean and variance used in the normalisation are calculated as follows. The expected value for a given tetramer is calculated as: and the variance is calculated using: which gives: Z (n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 ) = N (n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 ) − E (n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 ) σ 2 (n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 ) The resulting p-values of the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.

19646536,CO2 flux from Javanese mud volcanism,"Studying the quantity and origin of CO2 emitted by back-arc mud volcanoes is critical to correctly model fluid-dynamical, thermodynamical, and geochemical processes that drive their activity and to constrain their role in the global geochemical carbon cycle. We measured CO2 fluxes of the Bledug Kuwu mud volcano on the Kendeng Fold and thrust belt in the back arc of Central Java, Indonesia, using scanning remote sensing absorption spectroscopy. The data show that the expelled gas is rich in CO2 with a volume fraction of at least 16 vol %. A lower limit CO2 flux of 1.4 kg s-1 (117 t d-1) was determined, in line with the CO2 flux from the Javanese mud volcano LUSI. Extrapolating these results to mud volcanism from the whole of Java suggests an order of magnitude total CO2 flux of 3 kt d-1, comparable with the expected back-arc efflux of magmatic CO2. After discussing geochemical, geological, and geophysical evidence we conclude that the source of CO2 observed at Bledug Kuwu is likely a mixture of thermogenic, biogenic, and magmatic CO2, with faulting controlling potential pathways for magmatic fluids. This study further demonstrates the merit of man-portable active remote sensing instruments for probing natural gas releases, enabling bottom-up quantification of CO2 fluxes.","The concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere is a result of anthropogenic and natural CO 2 sources and sinks. Natural sources include biogenic and geological processes such as metamorphic breakdown of carbonates and magmatic degassing. Our quantitative understanding of the global geochemical carbon cycle is underpinned by empirical observations of the fluxes of CO 2 produced by geological processes [Le Cloarec and Marty, 1993; Burton et al., 2013; Kelemen and Manning, 2015] . Magmatic emissions from volcanic centers represent one of the key geological sources of CO 2 [Olivier et al., 1996; Gerlach et al., 2002; Etiope et al., 2007 , Burton et al., 2013 Lee et al., 2016] . Mud volcanism (MV) is produced by a combination of fault structures and sedimentary layers, often in back-arc areas, which produce CO 2 that is usually of a combined biogenic and geological origin. MV is the result of liquefied sediments and gases reaching the surface due to overpressure and buoyancy [Milkov, 2000; Dimitrov, 2002] . MV is a common feature in tectonically active regions with a predominantly compressive setting, such as in subduction zones. Thousands of mud volcanoes have been identified offshore [Milkov, 2000] , and at least hundreds exist onshore [Kopf, 2002] . Their sheer number implies that subaerial MV may contribute significantly to the atmospheric CO 2 budget and hence the geochemical carbon cycle. Furthermore, owing to their common proximity to volcanic arcs, they may play a key role in the overall picture of back-arc CO 2 emissions associated with arc volcanism, together with fore-arc and arc volcano degassing [Füri et al., 2010 , Giammanco et al., 2007 Westbrook and Smith, 1983] . Therefore, studying the role of volcanoes in the global carbon cycle should include investigating CO 2 emissions produced by MV. If CO 2 emitted by MV has a magmatic origin, the budget of mantle-derived CO 2 emitted by volcanism may have to be amended and models that describe carbon transfer from slab to mantle wedge and exosphere updated [Kerrick and Connolly, 2001; Connolly, 2005; Gorman et al., 2006; Poli et al., 2009] . The Indonesian archipelago located in the southern edge of Sundaland in Southeast Asia is extraordinarily rich for both arc volcanism and MV [Barber et al., 1986] . However, relatively limited CO 2 emission data are available. CO 2 emissions from these sources may contribute significantly to the country's total carbon emission, in addition to those of anthropogenic origin. Therefore, in addition to purely scientific goals, motivations to quantify natural CO 2 emission rates are hazard management and policy making regarding controls on Indonesian carbon emissions. Measuring gas emission rates (mass fluxes) requires gas concentration profiles and the transport speed of the emitted gas. Owing to high background atmospheric concentrations, CO 2 concentration profiles are usually obtained from grids of in situ measurements [e.g., Brantley and Koepenick, 1995; Shinohara, 2005; Hernández et al., 2015] . These techniques are often time consuming and, especially at volcanic sites and mud volcanoes, bear a safety risk. Remote sensing techniques provide a safe distance and a spatially integrated measurement, yielding gas concentration profiles that can directly be used to compute gas fluxes. Remote sensing is an established technique to measure volcanic SO 2 fluxes [Stoiber et al., 1983; Oppenheimer et al., 1998; Burton et al., 2000; Duffell et al., 2001; Galle et al., 2003] and, along with in situ data of CO 2 concentration, is used in a routine fashion to indirectly retrieve volcanic CO 2 fluxes [Gerlach et al., 1998; Burton et al., 2013] . LIDAR technology has recently advanced sufficiently to allow direct remote sensing of volcanic CO 2 fluxes, independent of sunlight [Aiuppa et al., 2015; Queißer et al., 2016] . In this study CO 2 from the Bledug Kuwu mud volcano complex located in Central Java, Indonesia, was probed using a novel, portable CO 2 LIDAR. The large volume of mud extruded by this mud volcano limited access to the main vent area, making CO 2 flux determinations using in situ CO 2 measurement techniques challenging. This setting was therefore deemed ideal for a remote sensing instrument and, in particular, our recently developed CO 2 LIDAR system [Queißer et al., 2016] , due to its flexibility, portability, and ease of use. The motivation for the campaign was twofold. First, the Bledug Kuwu MV complex underwent sampling of gas emission and composition [Mazzini et al., 2012] , but CO 2 fluxes have yet not been measured and a connection to arc volcanism has yet not been discussed. Second, the measurement offered a possibility to deploy a manportable active remote sensing instrument developed for volcanic CO 2 detection for the first time at a mud volcano. Bledug Kuwu is an active mud volcano located near the village of Kuwu in Central Java (Figure 1 ) in the backarc region of the Java subduction system [Whittaker et al., 2007] . The subduction process and its associated arc volcanism shape the topography of Java . A lateral cross section of a subduction zone typically reveals a systematic series of components in the landward direction: accretionary prism, fore-arc basin, arc volcanism, and back-arc region. In Java the geometry of the back-arc regions varies but it generally forms an elongated E-W basin to the north of the volcanic arc. The basin is filled by rapid sedimentation of terrigenous material [Smyth et al., 2005] . Persistent compressive stresses deformed the sediments, developing an imbrication of fold and reverse faults observable today. The topography of the back-arc region in the central and eastern part of Java is dominated by the prominent fold and thrust belt of Kendeng (Figure 1 ). Rapid sedimentation combined with the increasing stress from the subduction and vertical loading from the magmatic bodies creates favorable condition for the formation of MV [Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] . This is the area where Bledug Kuwu and other mud volcanoes are located, confined within a low relief zone. Within a radius of~2 km around Bledug Kuwu are four other mud volcanoes: Cangkring Bleduk, Bleduk Banjarsari, Bleduk Crewek, and Medang Kamolan [Istadi et al., 2012] . The nearest active volcano is Mount Lawu, located about 60 km to the south of Bledug Kuwu as part of the volcanic arc (Figure 1 ). The Bledug Kuwu mud volcano complex forms a low relief, nearly flat surface, about 700 m in diameter. The low relief of the crater and the dome indicates that the material is dominated by low viscosity sediments and that the fluidity of the material is maintained by the release of liquid and gasses [Istadi et al., 2012] . The active vent system consists of at least three eruption centers. Two main vents produce infrequent bursts of gas bubbles piercing the mud surface, forming semispherical shapes under the layer of mud, which then burst, splattering mud in all directions (Figure 2 ). Eruptions appear infrequent but occur at least twice a minute. The plume emitted at the main vents consists mainly of condensed water vapor that can be observed when the bubbles explode (Figure 2 ). The explosion is followed by a quasi-concentric movement of the plume front away from the center of the vent (Movie S1 in the supporting information) forming a ring pattern. Seismic reflection profiles reveal that the disturbed zone associated with Bledug Kuwu is produced by the upper part of Kujung formation passing Wonocolo formation and breaking onto the surface [Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] . Analysis of microfossils contained within the solid material extruded by Bledug Kuwu indicates that the source of the mud is located in the lower part of late Miocene Wonocolo shales about 2 km deep [ Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] . However, the seismic reflection data leave room for the possibility that the mud stems from early Miocene Tuban shales from 3 to 4 km depth.  The measurements at the Bledug Kuwu mud volcano field took place between the afternoon of the 27 September 2016 and morning of the 28 September 2016. The zone around the main vent of the mud field was probed using a purpose-built active laser remote sensing spectrometer, the CO 2 LIDAR [Queißer et al., 2016] . It uses an~1 W tunable near-infrared laser to illuminate a topographic feature behind the emitted gas and a receiver telescope to collect the backscattered radiation while the laser is tuned across a CO 2 absorption band at 1.57 μm. Figure 3a shows a map of Bledug Kuwu and the points where the instrument was located for the acquisitions. An earlier version of the CO 2 LIDAR has been described in detail in Queißer et al. [2016] , but continuous development of the instrument means that the version used on Bledug Kuwu has some key differences. The remote sensing spectrometer consists of a main unit (Figure 3b ) and the transmitter/receiver unit (TX/RX unit). The latter composes of the telescope, transmitter, and an integrating sphere for power reference measurement. A main difference to the previous instrument is that instead of interlacing two wavelengths on and off the CO 2 line, the CO 2 absorption line was sampled at 20 wavelengths by tuning the laser across the absorption line, such that the absorption maximum was located at the center of the wavelength sweep. A model absorption spectrum, the product of a background polynomial and the CO 2 transmittance curve, was fitted to the 20 measured transmittances resulting in a best estimate of the pathaveraged CO 2 concentration. As shown by Abshire et al. [2010] , this not only yielded additional information in terms of changes in baseline compared with the two-wavelength approach but also proved to be more robust to spectroscopic wavelength shifts and instrumental offsets due to wavelength dependencies (e.g., transmittance of instrument). In addition, for each retrieved value of CO 2 concentration an individual  Δσ is the molecular absorption cross sections of CO 2 associated with the wavelength corresponding to the absorption peak minus the absorption cross sections for the wavelength at minimum absorption (differential absorption cross section). F depicts the best fit transmittance, i.e., the fit of the transmittance values SR j measured at given wavelengths λ j (i.e., the spectrum). At a given wavelength, the spectrum was retrieved as where N S is the number of spectra to stack (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio) and S and R represent the strength of the atmospheric return and the transmitted signal, respectively, measured at 20 discrete wavelengths λ j ∈ [1, 20]. Although not used for the flux retrieval, for illustrative purposes, column-averaged path-averaged CO 2 mixing ratio (in ppm) were obtained from the column densities using where N air (in m ) is the dry air number density computed with knowledge of specific humidity, air pressure, and temperature and r depicts the range to the hard target. The CO 2 flux was computed as where u refers to the component of the plume transport speed perpendicular to the plane of the CO 2 concentration profile, i.e., the component perpendicular to the plane of the scan. M CO2 is the molar mass of CO 2 (in kg mol ) and N A is Avogadro's constant (in mol ). The constant scan angle increment Δβ was retrieved using the start and stop angles β S and β E of the scan as where N Spec depicts the total number of averaged spectra acquired during the scan. N col pl is the background-corrected CO 2 column density (the plume column density) obtained as bg , where N col bg is the background (ambient) CO 2 column density. r i is the range for spectrum i (or angle i as there was one average spectrum per angle). In the present case where the CO 2 LIDAR was placed on a tower and was scanning vertically, the angles were tilt angles and the range was computed as r i ¼ where h is the height of the instrument over ground (height of the tower) and To obtain u, the video tracking method described in detail in Queißer et al. [2016] was used. 10.1002/2017JB013968 Using error propagation, for a given scanning angle i (for clarity this index is omitted in the following equations), the uncertainty of the column-averaged mixing ratio was calculated as The uncertainty of the CO 2 flux was evaluated using where the range uncertainty Δr was estimated as (vertical scans only) where Δh is the uncertainty of h and σ β is the standard deviation of the tilt angle over the integration time per angle and is a measure of the steadiness (or linearity) of the tilt angle versus time. σ β is significant as the scans were carried out manually. σ β was retrieved from the asymptotic error of the linear fit of the recorded tilt angles over time. Since the stop angle did vary between scans, a bias Δβ bias that takes this variation into account was added. The bias was estimated as follows. The angle at which the signal disappeared indicated the last useful data; since near 0 tilt angle the beam started to overshoot the trees at the opposite edge of the MV complex used as hard target. That means that the stop angle (last angle of data with signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) ≥1) varied between À0.43 and À0.27°, adding a systematic error of Δβ bias = 0.17°. For a given angle i, the measurement precision ΔN col in equation (7) was calculated as described in Queißer et al. [2016] . In addition, it contains a variance accounting for the spectrum fitting error. This variance was retrieved as follows. The covariance matrix diagonal element corresponding to the best fit column density was, after taking the square root, scaled with the residual standard deviation of the fit (root-mean-square error). The uncertainty of the plume CO 2 column density in equation (8) was estimated as where σ N col bg is the standard deviation of the mean ambient column density used as a bias estimate that contributes to the uncertainty of the plume CO 2 column density.  The CO 2 LIDAR was placed on a platform about 200 m away from the center of the mud volcano to measure background ambient CO 2 (Figures 3a and 3b ). The ambient CO 2 concentration was obtained by measuring CO 2 column densities at the edge of the mud volcano field using trees at 280 m distance as a topographic target (the instrument was not scanned). The resulting column density was found to be N col bg = 2.74 × 10 24 m , which corresponds to a background CO 2 gas concentration of 410 ppm (equation (3)) with a precision of σ N col bg = 20 ppm. This is in agreement with expected background atmospheric concentrations. Just before the measurements commenced, the onboard range finder LIDAR of the CO 2 LIDAR ceased to function due to humidity-related problems. This means that ranges could not be measured on site. As a solution, distances were retrieved in the postprocessing using Google Earth software and visual recognition of the topographic features that were used as backscattering sources.  The measurement strategy was focussed on measuring the gas flux produced by the main vent associated with bursting gas bubbles. The telescope was aligned such that its optical axis passed just above the height where ejected gas bubbles reached, i.e.,~1.2 m above ground. The time between the burst of the bubble (release of gas started) and the end of the ejection (bubble disappeared) was typically between 1 and 3 s (Figure 2 ). To resolve these events, but ensure adequate averaging, the integration time was set to 0.5 s, corresponding to 10 spectra (sweep rate 20 Hz) being averaged (stacked) per retrieved CO 2 concentration value (i.e., per scan angle). This integration time was used for all measurements. Figure 4 shows an example of a fitted spectrum used to compute CO 2 column densities or mixing ratios (equations (1)- (3)). Every 2 to 20 s or so a gas bubble was produced by the mud volcano, ejecting gases, including water vapor and CO 2 , as well as mud. As the absorption strength of the ejected fluids and gases strongly varied the beam was sometimes blocked by mud leading to poorly recovered spectra. Using the approximate bubble diameter and the bubble frequency, a rough estimate of the expected CO 2 flux was obtained from where f bubble depicts the bubble burst frequency, d the bubble diameter, X CO2;bubble the volume ratio of CO 2 inside the bubble, and V m the molar volume of CO 2 . Although temperatures at seeps at Bledug Kuwu were found to be between 28 and 30°C [Satyana and Asnidar, 2008] , which is basically equal to the air temperature in that area, the presence of condensed water in the bursting bubbles indicated that the water was boiling and in the vapor phase with associated temperatures of at least 100°C when it reached the surface, in agreement with observations from Mazzini et al. [2012] . Flickering air in an~2 m thick layer just above ground moreover indicated advection of hot air (> 30°C ambient temperature). Thus, to compute the molar volume of the gas inside the bubble just before bursting a temperature of 100°C was considered. Half-spherically shaped bubbles were assumed. The bubble diameter was obtained from calibrated video footage (the same as used for the plume speed retrieval) and was ranging from 1.9 to 3.4 m (average 2.5 m). The main vent has Figure 4 . Spectrum acquired at Bledug Kuwu. Shown is the observed spectrum measured at 20 points (stack of 10 spectra, integration time 0.5 s) and the best fit transmittance. Figure 5. Static measurement of CO 2 from bursting bubbles. The graph shows path-averaged CO 2 concentrations from a static measurement performed on the 27 September 2016, aiming~1.2 m above ground, just above the bubble explosions, which occurred~200 m away from the CO 2 LIDAR. The instrument was located at position 1 (Figure 3a) . The standard deviation of the mixing ratios (error bars) varies and is on average 31 ppm as derived with equation (7) using a range uncertainty of 20 m. There were bursts at least 8 times per minute. The blue bars indicate an example ensemble of visually confirmed bursts. The major peak at 13:03:20 is related to at least eight bubble explosions. The dotted line indicates the ambient CO 2 mixing ratio of 410 ppm.  been probed for 30 min out of which Figure 5 shows about 10 min. The time series suggests that the volume of ejected CO 2 was very variable, which was also indicated by the inconstant sizes of the bursting bubbles. Note that due to the limited field of view of the telescope (~0.6 m at bubble), which was passing the bubbles at~1 m horizontal distance, and the dispersion of the CO 2 , the bubble bursts identified visually do not necessarily coincide with the concentration peaks in Figure 5 . However, as the larger concentration peaks likely correspond to larger bubbles (or clusters of fast occurring bubble bursts) they should coincide more than the smaller peaks. Automatically counting the peaks associated with CO 2 mixing ratios above average ambient mixing ratio plus twice the standard deviation (2σ N col bg ¼ 40 ppm) yielded a bubble burst frequency of 0.15 ± 0.04 s À1 or 9 ± 2.4 per minute. This is consistent with the estimated frequency of 7.5 explosions per minute from visual observation using the video footage. The bubbles were assumed to contain CO 2 only (i.e., bubble volume ratio X CO2;bubble = 1), yielding an upper limit flux of 0.9 ± 0.5 kg s À1 , just for the main vent, where for the uncertainty in bubble frequency and diameter is accounted for. Note that mainly due to the assumption of a single bubble bursting at a time and the semispherical shape assumption, this is a rough estimate merely yet providing an order of magnitude estimate of the CO 2 output of Bledug Kuwu. Since the gas plume advected horizontally, horizontal scanning of the plume was not adequate to retrieve the CO 2 flux, but it yielded valuable information about the shape and extension of the plume. Six consecutive scans were performed from two different instrument locations near each other (Figure 3a ). Since the forest behind the mud volcano complex was used as a hard target, using Google Earth and the start and stop heading angle of the scans, the ranges could be reconstructed. This resulted in a larger range uncertainty, which was considered 20 m for all ranges (error assessment follows in discussion). The TX/RX unit was rotated around the vertical axis with a velocity of 4 mrad/s (0.24°/s), corresponding tõ 80 cm/s at the vent location, and was scanning the main vent (position 1, Figure 3a ). The beam propagated 1.5 m above ground, which means that it would pass undisturbed by most of the aerosols and mud expelled from the bubble bursts below it but would probe the gas expelled by the bubble. For some heading angles the laser may have been scattered not by the trees but by small water droplets or mud around the location of the vent. The resulting CO 2 mixing ratios are shown in Figure 6a . The sector associated with the circular zone of CO 2 propagating from the main vent outward corresponds to the angles between about 17°and 36°, associated with a lateral dimension of~60 m. Interestingly, the minor vent (vent III, Figure 3a ), which coincides with the twin peak near 30°has associated mixing ratios of magnitude equal to those near the main peak at 20°(associated with vent II). The oscillations between 41°and 50°are likely due to a changing hard target distance (such as tree lines at closer distance), which was difficult to discern without on-site range data. Mixing ratios far below the ambient level may indicate short ranges and that the beam was reflected by flying debris or dense condensed water vapor. The data were not omitted as the spectra were well recovered. A repeated scan from a point 40 m close to the first instrument location (position 2, Figure 3a) showed a symmetrically decaying CO 2 concentration peak for the location of the main vent (10°, Figure 6b ). As opposed to  the scan before in Figure 6a , the CO 2 mixing ratio for vent III (near 17°) is not very high. However, there are peaks near 3 and 4°, which correspond to the zone~16 to 18 m west of the main vent (II). This area was in immediate reach of the concentric waves of gas emerging from the main vent, which have likely caused these peaks. To obtain the CO 2 flux, the CO 2 concentration profile perpendicular to the propagation vector of the gas plume was needed. As the gas plume propagated horizontally (Movie S1) this required a vertical scan of the plume. Due to logistical constraints, the available equipment included neither tripod nor step motor. It was therefore decided to attempt a manual scan using the handrail of an observation tower as a mechanical support. This was an opportunity to assess whether the CO 2 LIDAR would provide useful data in hand-held operation. With the TX/RX unit placed on the handrail the instrument's height above ground was h = 5.3 m. The telescope's line of sight was intersecting the plume transport direction perpendicularly (Figures 3a and 3c) . The scanning plane was located downwind,~17 m west of the main vent (II). This means that the measured flux would correspond to the combined output of vents II and III (Figure 3a ). Starting from a tilt angle of À4°(À0.07 rad), the TX/RX unit was manually moved upward so that the tilt angle was gradually increased until it reached 0. After a few trial runs the vertical scans were rather smooth, indicated by the linearity of the tilt angle with time. This is shown in Figure 3d for one of the scans along with the linear fit. The maximum asymptotic error σ β = 3 × 10 À3°/ s (0.05 mrad/s) of the linear fits of all scans was used as the tilt angle random error (standard deviation of the tilt angle, equation (9)). This corresponds to 8% of the scanning rate of 0.036°/s (0.6 mrad/s). The telescope was thus considered moving steadily. As before, spectra were acquired continuously at a rate of 20 Hz (50 ms sweep time per spectrum) and saved to disk each 0.5 s. Each tilt angle i was associated with a stack of 10 spectra (0.5 s integration time). Nine repetitions of the scan were recorded. The resulting CO 2 column densities and mixing ratios as a function of tilt angles and corresponding hard target ranges are shown in Figure 7 . Despite the irregular degassing activity, both in terms of frequency and in terms of ejected volume (varying bubble size), column-averaged maximum mixing ratios usually peak around 1500 ppm, for some scans (e.g., Figures 7a, 7c , and 7d) much higher than that, up to at least 2400 ppm. The center of the mud volcano mouth was located at a range of 230 m. Although these peaks fluctuate from scan to scan, the highest mixing ratios are predominantly found near that range, betweeñ 130 and~300 m. This range is consistent with the observed maximum water vapor plume extent, indicating the minimum radial extension of the CO 2 plume. The prevailing transport direction of the plume was toward northwest, explaining a possibly a concentric distribution of the plume. This may have led to higher CO 2 concentrations toward north, that is, toward the instrument position. It is also important to note that the X CO2 represent total column-averaged mixing ratios, which include ambient CO 2 . So with increasing range the relative contribution of the plume CO 2 to X CO2 decreases. There is a reoccurring peak near 120 m. An explanation could be that due to the reoccurrence of bubble explosions, peaks farther away from the vent stemmed from previous bubble explosions seconds before. On the video (Movie S1) this is revealed by concentric waves of condensed water vapor overriding each other as they propagate along the ground. The same was probably true for the CO 2 . The column density remains high after the bubble center (after~270 m). Note that the range increased nonlinearly with tilt angle, which means that the associated column densities correspond to much lower CO 2 mixing ratios (Figure 7) . Assuming an air density of~1.2 kg m À3 , even at a gas temperature of 100°C upon exiting the vent, the CO 2 density would still have been higher than the air density. The CO 2 therefore would have still not been buoyant but held down by gravity. However, the instrument might well have been probing plume CO 2 at ranges >400 m, due to the quasi-steady supply by the vents and the fact that for a given vertical scanning angle the laser beam height above ground geometrically decreased (Figure 3c ). For instance, for the given range of r = 660 m, the height above ground for 230 m, 300 m, and 400 m away from the instrument was 4.7 m, 3.3 m, and 2.5 m, respectively. This is of the order of the bubble diameter. The vertical plume velocity component was zero. The horizontal transport speed was remarkably constant and associated with a constant progression of the plume fronts emanating from the center of the puddle (the bubble burst zone), which were tracked. A single value for the plume speed resulting from the For each scan the CO 2 flux was computed using equation (4) and the uncertainties using equation (8). The results are presented in Table 1 . The average flux of all nine scans is 1.4 ± 0.8 kg s À1 or 117 ± 68 t d or 43 kt yr . It agrees with the flux estimated for vent II of 0.9 ± 0.5 kg s À1 using equation (11). Note that 1.4 kg s accounts for both vents II and III. However, the video footage revealed that bubble explosions at vent III were at least 20 times less frequent and the bubble diameter is about 3 times smaller, implying that, given the error bars, 1.4 kg s À1 represents the flux of the main vent II to first order.  The SNR contributed an uncertainty of~2% of the column density, whereas the fit contribution varied Figure 7 . (a-i) CO 2 column densities and converted mixing ratios for the vertical scans. The scans were acquired on the 28 September 2016 between 7 h11 and 7 h47 A.M. local time. They are presented in the order they were carried out. Each scan took~1 min and was spanning the complete extension of the mud volcano field. The column densities resulting from these scans were used to compute the CO 2 fluxes in Table 1 . The grey shaded area depicts the ambient CO 2 mixing ratio of 410 ppm.   between 4% of the column density for a smooth spectrum and 20% for a noisy spectrum. The resulting relative uncertainty of N col pl was between 4% and 30%, mainly depending on the quality of the fit, which in some cases dominated the uncertainty. For the vertical scans, the fit error alone contributed an uncertainty of the CO 2 flux of 44% on average. Highest fit errors are produced from relatively noisy spectra collected in the near and the very far range measurements. For the shorter ranges (< 150 m) speckle noise contributes significantly [Queißer et al., 2016] . For the longer ranges the angle increment Δβ produced a field of view, which included a wide topographic target range (e.g.,~0.5 m near 0.07 rad versus~25 m near 0.01 rad). Along with bushes and trees that were found near the edge of the mud volcano this significantly altered the target reflectivity during each sweep, producing an additional interfering signal in the transmittance spectra. Furthermore, it was raining during the vertical scans (see Movie S1). Other than an increased light extinction and thus noisy spectra, particularly for the longer ranges, this gave rise to an angle-dependent noise contribution [Roy and Bissonette, 2001] . Water puddles at places produced reflectivity patterns of small-scale (~m) heterogeneity (mud versus water) that could have introduced noise in the spectra, especially those collected at longer range. One should also mention that the relatively short integration time of 0.5 s (stack of 10 subsequent spectra) was contributing to a rather high fitting error. On the other hand, a short integration time was needed to account for the plume dynamics, so that the ""frozen plume"" assumption holds. As far as the range error is concerned, for the horizontal scans and the static measurement, the lack of range data entailed an increase in range uncertainty from <1 m (with the range finder) to 20 m. For the vertical scans the range uncertainty is accounted for by the angle uncertainty (equation (9)). For the horizontal scans the increase in range uncertainty corresponded to an increase in uncertainty of the CO 2 mixing ratios of up to 40%, depending on the range and relative error of the column density (equation (7)). For the vertical scans, the lack of the range finder entailed an increase in flux uncertainty between 5% (scan d) and 10% (scan a). Temperature and pressure uncertainties cause an uncertainty in differential absorption cross section, which contributes to the error of the CO 2 column density. The pressure was steady. Assuming a realistic temperature uncertainty of 2 K, the error of N col pl due to temperature uncertainty was only 0.3% and hence was neglected. Given that the Bledug Kuwu is a local tourist destination and visitors approach the main vent as close as 20 m (based on our observation), it is beneficial to assess CO 2 emissions from a health and safety perspective. Measured CO 2 mixing ratios in the vicinity of the main vent (~80 m around the crater) were found to reach up to 2400 ppm, that is, averaged over the path length (Figure 7) . In terms of personal health and safety this value is well below the threshold of 5000 ppm per 8 h exposure [EH40/2005 [EH40/ , 2011 . A high-risk columnaveraged concentration (> 15,000 ppm over 15 min) would only be caused if there was an area of a few meter size with nearly pure CO 2 , for instance, a 2.5 m path (to take the average size of a bubble) consisting of 90% CO 2 . The retrieved CO 2 flux of 117 t d À1 is in line with that measured at the LUSI mud volcano, also located in the Kendeng Basin, 180 km east of Bledug Kuwu (Figure 1) , which was reported to be between 35 and 160 t d À1 [Vanderkluysen et al., 2014] . This order of magnitude of CO 2 flux compares with the lower end of volcanic emission rates, such as Vulcano, Italy [Gerlach et al., 1997] , and, by itself, is dwarfed by the anthropogenic carbon emissions in Indonesia, which are of the order of 274 kt d À1 (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/ido.html). For a comparable emission rate, hundreds of Bledug Kuwu-like emitters would be necessary. It is not straightforward to provide an estimate of the total CO 2 flux of Javanese back-arc MV since there is no comprehensive summary of all Javanese MV, and the number of MV in the literature is inconsistent between different sources [Satyana and Asnydar, 2008; Guntoro, 2011] . Moreover, MV may sometimes not be defined as such. For instance, Kamojang, located in Western Java, is characterized as a geothermal field with mud pods [Setijadji, 2010] . In addition, the CO 2 content of the gas emitted by Javanese MV generally varies strongly. For example, the molecular composition observed for gas emitted by different MV near LUSI varied between <1% and 99 vol % of CO 2 [Mazzini et al., 2012] . Nevertheless, encouraged by the similarity of the CO 2 flux between LUSI and Bledug Kuwu, we attempt at least an order of magnitude estimation. A  conservative number of Java's subaerial MV is 28, of which 23 are located in the eastern half of Java (Table 2) . The highest MV density is found in the province of East Java. Extrapolating the fluxes of LUSI and Bledug Kuwu on all Javanese MV yields an order of magnitude CO 2 flux of 3 kt d . Mount Merapi's CO 2 flux is 600 t d À1 (vented + diffuse slope degassing) during quiescent periods [Toutain et al., 2009] . Extrapolating this value over the 20 or so, actively degassing Javanese arc volcanoes yields a ballpark figure of 12 kt d À1 for the CO 2 emitted by Javenese arc volcanism. This implies that the extrapolated CO 2 flux from Javanese back-arc MV accounts for 3/12 or 25% of the CO 2 flux from arc volcanism in Java. In general, the back-arc diffuse degassing of magmatic carbon is estimated to account for roughly 26% of the carbon flux of arc volcanoes at subduction zones [Kelemen and Manning, 2015] . If assumed that backarc outgassing of magmatic carbon occurs mainly via CO 2 , this suggests that the extrapolated mass of carbon emitted by Javanese MV is comparable with the mass emitted by back-arc diffuse outgassing (not emitted by arc volcanoes). The question arises whether some of the CO 2 emitted by the back-arc MV is of magmatic origin. Here we examine possible sources of CO 2 emitted at Bledug Kuwu. We highlight that our data do not permit an unequivocal conclusion with regard to CO 2 sources; however, the key mechanisms can be examined and compared. A major constituent of the gas emitted at Bledug Kuwu is water vapor. This is apparent from visual observation of the bubbles, which upon bursting produce abundant condensed water vapor fumes (Figure 2 ), suggesting decompression of water vapor to drive the explosions. The fact that one can observe a point source of expelled CO 2 and since the CO 2 is expelled along with water suggests that CO 2 was originally dissolved in water in the saturated zone. In this sense the eruption can be modeled and characterized as a geyser. We therefore adopt the conceptual model of a geyser [Lu et al., 2005] , which consists of a conduit between the surface and an underground chamber where liquid is heated, decreases in density, and ascends up the conduit to the surface, boiling during ascent. Such a conduit is consistent with the general understanding of mud volcanoes as soft matter migrating toward the surface through low-pressure channels in the form of liquid mud diapirs and gas. The eruption mode at Bledug Kuwu is similar to LUSI [Mazzini et al., 2012] and can be characterized by a churn flow regime, that is, a multiphase gas flow with interacting bubbles upon boiling [Vanderkluysen et al., 2014] . CO 2 is considered to have been dissolved in the aquifer water before exsolving during ascent or in a shallow storage zone. It is assumed that all water evaporates completely upon the bubble explosion, so that all CO 2 separates from the water. The molar ratio between water vapor and CO 2 observed after the bubble explosion therefore represents, to first order, the molar ratio in the subsurface when CO 2 was dissolved in the water. In addition to water vapor and CO 2 , mud volcanoes may emit methane and other gases. Since our CO 2 LIDAR measured CO 2 only, trace gas compositions of the bubble could not be analyzed. Mazzini et al. [2012] reported, however, that the gas expelled at Bledug Kuwu is dominated by CO 2 . This is in line with Satyana and Asnidar [2008] , who stated that the emitted gases at Bledug Kuwu have been reported to be mainly H 2 O and CO 2 with traces of H 2 S. We therefore assume that the methane content of the gases expelled at Bledug Kuwu is present in low amounts and it is not considered in our mass balance calculation. The ejected liquid is thus treated as a two-phase mixture of muddy water and a gas phase of water vapor and CO 2 . Using equation (11) and plugging in the flux obtained with the CO 2 LIDAR and solving for X CO2;bubble yields a CO 2 volume fraction of 1. The inputs for equation (11) have significant uncertainties. Considering the maximum error caused by the uncertainties of the flux, bubble diameter and bubble frequency yield that a minimum fraction of 0.16 of the volume of the ejected bubbles at the main vent at Bledug Kuwu was occupied by pure CO 2 . Considering that both CO 2 and water vapor are at the same temperature and pressure implies that their molar ratio is at least 16:84 or 0.19. For simplicity we consider that all the CO 2 is dissolved in brine up to a certain depth (and pressure). Then Henry's law can be employed together with the molar ratio of H 2 O vapor and CO 2 gas to estimate the subsurface pressure at which CO 2 exsolved from the brine. A gas temperature of 100°C upon piercing the surface is considered here. Considering a water density of 1030 kg/m 3 using the relationship of Crovetto [1991] , the Henry volatility constant is retrieved as 96 L atm mol . Neglecting the fact that the salt content in the brine decreases solubility and that the molar ratio of 0.19 of CO 2 is a lower limit and considering the geothermal gradient with temperatures at the Kendang base likely higher than 300°C [Nurhandoko et al., 2016; Putra et al., 2016] yields a pressure of at least~106 MPa or a minimum dissolution depth of 10 km. The large negative gravity anomaly of the Kendeng zone indicates a deep sedimentary basin with an average sediment thickness of~6 km that may reach down to 10 km below where Bledug Kuwu is located [Untung and Sato, 1978; Waltham et al., 2008] . It is therefore possible that the CO 2 observed at Bledug Kuwu originated from the basement of the Kendeng Basin or from below. Mazzini et al. [2012] noted that samples taken at different vents at mud volcano sites may exhibit different isotopic signatures, suggesting mixed sources of CO 2 . For instance, at LUSI three samples suggested volcanic origin of the CO 2 , while the majority of samples taken at LUSI pointed toward an organic origin of CO 2 . Setijadji [2010] considered Bledug Kuwu not being linked to a volcanic center. This is supported by the reported δ 13 C of the CO 2 of À18.8‰ measured at Bledug Kuwu, which indicates an organic origin of the CO 2 , such as from decarboxylation of kerogen [Mazzini et al., 2012] . Potential CO 2 source rocks include the kerogene bearing, 4400 m deep Ngimbang rock formation [Mazzini et al., 2012] , and the deeper Paleocene pre-Ngimbang formation [Satyana and Purwaningsih, 2003; Wiloso et al., 2009] . The corresponding depth region near the base of the Kendeng Basin (Eocene) is, however, poorly studied and leaves room for alternative sources. As it is located in a setting favorable for hydrocarbon production [Satyana and Purwaningsih, 2003; Wiloso et al., 2009] , it is remarkable that Bledug Kuwu is dominated by emission of CO 2 rather than methane. This advocates the prospect that at least to some extent the CO 2 may originate from oxidation of methane via reduction of pyrite and SO 4 [Seewald et al., 1994; Mazzini et al., 2012] . Java is located in a tectonically active region with extensive deformation observed throughout the arc. Thrusting once displaced some of the early Cenozoic volcanic arc to which Mount Muria belongs northward (Figure 1) . Central Java hosts a series of these northward directed thrusts [Clements et al., 2009] . Bledug Kuwu and other MV of Central Java are mainly located along the NE-SW Kendeng Fault, which is dominated by thrusting. Some of the folds and thrusts are torn by strike-slip faults oriented obliquely to the trend of the thrust fault and fold axis. Many of the mud volcanoes are found in the intersection of these structures. The association of mud volcanoes with these structures suggests that faulting and folding are the chief control of MV emplacement in the region [Setijadji, 2010; Roberts et al., 2011] . These faults on Java are potentially acting as a pathway for hydrothermal fluids to the surface [Mazzini et al., 2014] . It is peculiar that some of the MV are methane dominated and associated with colder temperatures <100°C [Mazzini et al., 2012] , while the CO 2 -dominated MV emissions are hot, such as Bledug Kuwu and LUSI. A CO 2 dissolution depth of 10 km or more below Bledug Kuwu would likely be in reach of rising volcanic fluids. This raises the possibility that in the Bledug Kuwu case an igneous intrusion or magma storage zone may be both a source of heat and CO 2 , leaking into the sedimentary basin through fractures. Mazzini et al. [2012] postulated the occurrence of a magma chamber at 6 km depth that may interact with sediments at the base of the Kendeng Basin. Earthquake attenuation tomography is capable of outlining zones of high attenuation and seismic velocity anomaly, such as caused by magma. Bohm et al. [2013] performed seismic attenuation tomography using arrivals from earthquakes down to 200 km depth below Central Java. The model resolution of 15 km vertical and 30 km horizontal was too coarse to help differentiate between zones of high temperature, such as magma intrusions, and the water-saturated sediments of the Kendeng Basin, which also strongly attenuate seismic energy. Their models suggested fluid-saturated sediments down to 15 km depth at the Kendeng Basin. The findings, however, did not indicate a large-scale, high attenuation channel between partial melt zones of the volcanic centers (<15 km to 30 km depth) and the Kendeng Basin, which would imply pathways for magma, partial melts or CO 2 rich fluids. In line with the high attenuation at the location of the Kendeng Basin, passive seismic velocity tomography performed by Koulakov et al. [2007 and and active seismic tomography carried out by Wagner et al. [2007] indicated the occurrence of a strong low-velocity anomaly (Merapi Lawu anomaly, MLA) north of the volcanic arc, reaching at least until Mount Lawu to the east (Figure 1) . They explained the anomaly by Basin contains brine-saturated sediments and shales (e.g., Wonocolo and Ngimbang). Beneath Bledug Kuwu an upward convex mud diapir (not to scale) is fed by brine-saturated sediment layers. As they cool, partial melts and volcanic liquids pond beneath the basin basement or enter the basin via faults. Between 15 and 11 km depth CO 2 could exolve from the partial melt, potentially migrate through faults, and dissolve into sediment brine, which moves upward. As depth decreases the mud diapir forms. With pressure decreasing, close to the surface, the uprising muddy brine boils with large bubbles piercing the surface, releasing water vapor and CO 2 . Not shown are other potential CO 2 source mechanisms involved, such as contact metamorphism, oxydation of methane, or decarboxylation.  thick sediments, saturated with fluids and gases, and also magma and partial melts. Unlike the seismic attenuation model of Bohm et al. [2013] , their velocity models suggested the MLA to continue until the subducting slab, that is, beneath the volcanic arc at~120 km depth. Their model therefore indicates a potential pathway of magmatic CO 2 into the Kendeng Basin. It is possible that melts or partial melts reach the base of the Kendeng Basin where their temperature is lowered by relatively cold sediments of the Kendeng Basin, which are sealing off the hot volcanic fluids or allow small amounts of volcanic fluids to penetrate the sedimentary layers near the basement base [Wagner et al., 2007; Koulakov et al., 2009] . Koulakov et al. [2009] furthermore suggested the possible presence of magmatic lenses reaching up to 11 km depth. In summary, based on seismic tomography, magmatic CO 2 could indeed reach the Kendeng Basin, be dissolved in brine, and eventually be expelled via mud volcanoes. Figure 8 illustrates this possibility by showing a potential pathway of magmatic CO 2 into the mud diaper of Bledug Kuwu. But owing to the limited resolution of~15 km of the data, this remains a possibility rather than a fact. In the light of a mixed origin of the CO 2 not all of the CO 2 reaching the surface is dissolved below 10 km. More likely, an unknown amount of magmatic CO 2 , corresponding to a fraction of the measured 1.4 kg s , is dissolved at depths of 10 km or below, while biogenic and thermogenic CO 2 , dissolve at shallower depths, for instance, at~4000 m within the Ngimbang rock formation. This means that the CO 2 /H 2 O molar ratio at a given depth and the nucleation depth of CO 2 bubbles are unknown. Given all evidence combined, it is likely that the CO 2 emitted at Bledug Kuwu is a mixture of thermogenic or biogenic CO 2 and magmatic CO 2 . Volcanic fluids and melts could also catalyze CO 2 production. As speculated for the alike LUSI [Mazzini et al., 2012] , rocks near the base of the Kendeng Basin could be affected by intruding magma or partial melts and, due to the heat supply, promote thermogenic production of CO 2 from the limestone basement of the basin through contact metamorphism. Although geological, geophysical, and geochemical mapping has been done for Central Java, at the current stage more confining evidence, particularly of the geochemical sort, is necessary to exclude that CO 2 expelled by Bledug Kuwu and other MV in Central Java is not of volcanic origin. A powerful yet inexpensive approach compared with, for instance, high-resolution seismic could be to measure CO 2 / 3 He ratios. Studying the quantity and origin of CO 2 emitted by back-arc mud volcanoes is important to correctly model the thermodynamics and geochemistry of arc volcanoes and to constrain their role in the carbon budget and hence the global geochemical carbon cycle. Using remote sensing laser absorption spectroscopy, an average CO 2 flux of 1.4 kg s À1 or 117 t d À1 (43 kt yr ) was found at Bledug Kuwu mud volcano. The flux stems from two of three identified main vents and thus represents a lower limit. The gas flow was characterized as a two-phase slug flow of brine and CO 2 with CO 2 dissolving at depths that may reach below 10 km. Geochemical and geological evidence suggest the CO 2 observed at Bledug Kuwu to be of biogenic or thermogenic origin. Seismic tomography, the tectonic setting, and the depth of the CO 2 origin, on the other hand, favor at least a partly magmatic origin of the CO 2 . A more focused effort, such as noble gas tracing, is needed to clarify the origin of the CO 2 released at Bledug Kuwu, in particular the contribution of magmatic CO 2 if there is any. This study not only demonstrated the merit of a man-portable active remote sensing instrument for probing natural gas releases but also showed feasibility of a hand-held scan of a gas release to obtain the gas flux, enabling efficient bottom-up estimation of CO 2 fluxes. To our knowledge, this was the first time the CO 2 flux of a mud volcano was measured using ground-based remote sensing.",M. Queißer,2017,28944134,10.1002/2017JB013968
31592443,"Methanogenic activity and diversity in the centre of the Amsterdam Mud Volcano, Eastern Mediterranean Sea","Marine mud volcanoes are geological structures emitting large amounts of methane from their active centres. The Amsterdam mud volcano (AMV), located in the Anaximander Mountains south of Turkey, is characterized by intense active methane seepage produced in part by methanogens. To date, information about the diversity or the metabolic pathways used by the methanogens in active centres of marine mud volcanoes is limited. 14C-radiotracer measurements showed that methylamines/methanol, H2/CO2 and acetate were used for methanogenesis in the AMV. Methylotrophic methanogenesis was measured all along the sediment core, Methanosarcinales affiliated sequences were detected using archaeal 16S PCR-DGGE and mcrA gene libraries, and enrichments of methanogens showed the presence of Methanococcoides in the shallow sediment layers. Overall acetoclastic methanogenesis was higher than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, which is unusual for cold seep sediments. Interestingly, acetate porewater concentrations were extremely high in the AMV sediments. This might be the result of organic matter cracking in deeper hotter sediment layers. Methane was also produced from hexadecanes. For the most part, the methanogenic community diversity was in accordance with the depth distribution of the H2/CO2 and acetate methanogenesis. These results demonstrate the importance of methanogenic communities in the centres of marine mud volcanoes.",". Based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, ANME are 35 divided in three distinct clusters, namely ANME-1, ANME-2 and ANME-3, 36 phylogenetically distantly (for the ANME-1) or closely (for the ANME-2) related to 37 methanogens (Lösekann et al., 2007) . The close phylogeny between the ANME and 38 methanogens and the biochemical link of both pathways in the methane cycle 39 suggest a co-evolution in their biochemistry (Knittel & Boetius, 2009 ). The mcrA gene 40 encoding the methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzing the final step of the 41 methanogenic pathway, is unique and found in all methanogens and anaerobic 42 methanotrophs (Thauer, 1998) . we also studied the community structure of methanogens. Methanogenic activities 60 based on the three substrate types were measured in various depths along a 6 m 61 gravity core. Depth distribution of dissolved cations were quantified from diluted porewater using 106 standard ion chromatographic techniques, at the Ifremer laboratory. Cation 107 concentrations were measured using ion exchange chromatography, with a isocratic 108 DX120 ion chromatogtaphy system (DIONEX Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) fitted with 109 Ionpac CS 12A columns and a suppressor (CSRS-ultra II) unit in combination with a 110 DS4-1 heated conductivity cell. Components were separated using a 111 methanesulfonic acid (18 mM) gradient, with a flow of 1 ml min -1 . 112 Porewater sulfate and acetate concentrations were measured in triplicate for each 113 section, by ion exchange chromatography using an ICS-2000 ion chromatography 114 system (Dionex®, UK) fitted with two AS15-HC 4 mm columns inseries, and a 115 Dionex® Anion Self-Regenerating Suppressor (ASRS®-ULTRA II 4-mm) unit in 116 combination with a Dionex®DS6 heated conductivity cell, Cardiff University, UK. 117 Components were separated using a potassium hydroxide gradient program as 118 follows: 6.0 mM KOH (38 min isocratic), 16.0 mM KOH min-1 to70 mM (17 min 119 isocratic). 120 Methane concentrations were determined from 3 cm 3 sediment sample without 121 replication, sealed in glass tubes containing 6 ml of NaOH (2.5% w/v), on board 122 using the headspace technique coupled with a gas chromatograph GC (HSS-GC) 123 equipped with a thermal-conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame-ionization detector 124 (error of 4%). Helium was the carrier gas, and column temperature was 40°C (details 125 in (Sarradin & Caprais, 1996) . 126 127 Radiotracer experiments using 14C-labelled substrates were conducted in the 129 laboratory at Cardiff University, UK according to Parkes 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 F o r P e e r R e v i e w dggeB1 was affiliated with the ANME-1 group (95 % of similarity) (Table 1), and  338 bands B8, B10, B11, B14 to B16 with the ANME-2 group (80 to 94 % of similarity). 339 Bands AmK-dggeB2, B5 to B7 were affiliated with the order Methanomicrobiales (75 340 to 80 % of similarity).

The methanogenic substrates utilized by strain S3FaT were formate and H2/CO2 but not acetate, secondary alcohols, methylamines, methanol or ethanol. Cells of strain S3FaT were non-motile, irregular cocci, 0.5–1.0 μm in diameter. The surface-layer protein showed an Mr of 128 000.The optimum growth conditions were 37 °C, pH 7.1 and 0.17 M NaCl. The DNA G+C content of the genome of strain S3FaT was 62.3 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain S3FaT was most closely related to Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1T (99.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Genome relatedness between strain S3FaT and Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1T was computed using both genome-to-genome distance analysis (GGDA) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) with values of 46.3–55.5 % and 93.08 %, respectively. Based on morphological, phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic relatedness data, it is evident that strain S3FaT represents a novel species of the genus Methanoculleus, for which the name Methanoculleus sediminis sp. nov. is proposed.

15514304,Eruption of a deep-sea mud volcano triggers rapid sediment movement,"Submarine mud volcanoes are important sources of methane to the water column. However, the temporal variability of their mud and methane emissions is unknown. Methane emissions were previously proposed to result from a dynamic equilibrium between upward migration and consumption at the seabed by methane-consuming microbes. Here we show non-steady-state situations of vigorous mud movement that are revealed through variations in fluid flow, seabed temperature and seafloor bathymetry. Time series data for pressure, temperature, pH and seafloor photography were collected over 431 days using a benthic observatory at the active Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano. We documented 25 pulses of hot subsurface fluids, accompanied by eruptions that changed the landscape of the mud volcano. Four major events triggered rapid sediment uplift of more than a metre in height, substantial lateral flow of muds at average velocities of 0.4m per day, and significant emissions of methane and CO2 from the seafloor.","T8 Sensor  The short temperature lance was installed on 2009-07-24 at the HMMV centre, where, based on the mean geothermal gradient 1 , we expected the highest level of activity. The lance was inserted vertically by ROV with full penetration. However, when we visually inspected the location on 2010-09-27 immediately prior to recovery, the lance was lying flat on the sediment surface and the cable connecting the lance to its logger on the observatory frame appeared to be fully stretched. On 2009-10-26, two days after the sudden uplift event P2, the temperature signal of all sensors began to decrease at 03:40 UTC and reached bottom water levels at 06:20 UTC (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This can only be explained by the lance being pulled out due to lateral sediment displacement, a process that also caused trail marks (""wakes"") around other sensors too ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Assuming a stable sediment temperature profile at this time, the vertical motion of the lance reconstructed by calculating the depths of the sensors from the temperature profile prior to its extraction from sediment yielded a peak upward velocity of around 0.6 m/h ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). As the extraction of the short T-lance from the seabed was probably a combination of vertical, horizontal, and rotational movements, the reconstructed vertical velocity is a conservative estimate. During the time period between deployment and its extraction the temperature profiles recorded by the short lance documented the continuous cooling of the surface sediments from an initial temperature gradient of nearly 18 °C/m to less than 10 °C/m.  Interestingly, the gas venting ( Supplementary Fig. 6, 7 and 8) did not cause substantial anomalies in the turbidity sensor mounted on the LOOME observatory frame, situated upstream of the vents. Instead, the turbidity signals that can be detected from our time series record were all rather low (<2 NTU) despite being frequent, and appear to only be partially associated with the seafloor fluid flow events that our work has detected ( Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) .

The highly reducing conditions of the vent fields associated with midocean ridges fulfill one of the most stringent conditions for the stabilization of biomolecules. These conditions are a consequence of the metamorphic hydration and oxidation of ultramafic rocks of the oceanic lithosphere-a series of reactions known as serpentinization-that release highly reduced hydrothermal fluids with high concentrations of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen (4, 5) . Serpentinization also produces FeNi 3 , which catalyses formation of complex organic compounds (5) . Serpentinization thus provides both a source of reduced carbon and a potential energy source, which, together, create an environment suitable for the emergence of the first biomolecules. The vast majority of hydrothermal vent fields, however, especially those hosted by midocean ridges, spout solutions with pH well below the pK of amino acids, which makes them unsuitable for Strecker synthesis (6, 7) . Attention therefore shifted toward high-pH hydrothermal vent sites (8, 9) and notably toward the modern vent fluids from the unusual midocean ridge locality of Lost City. The search for an Archean environment in which reducing and high-pH conditions coexist at temperatures appropriate for supporting early life prompted us to investigate Isua serpentinites and their associated hydrothermal carbonates (10) . Precipitation of large amounts of carbonates suggests that carbonate ions were abundant in the parent fluid and therefore signals that the pH of this fluid was at least in the range of the second dissociation constant of carbonic acids, which for seawater at ambient temperature is approximately 9 (11). Recent work on isotope fractionation of Zn complexes in solution (hydrates, or aqua ions, chlorides, sulfides, sulfates, carbonates) (12, 13) indicates that Zn carbonates efficiently fractionate Zn isotopes. Measurements of Zn isotopes for Isua serpentinites revealed anomalous values (14) . Therefore, a more systematic investigation of Zn isotopes in samples from this locality seemed promising. Focusing on this particular metal was reinforced by the proposition that, because transition elements are less mobile than the volatile elements commonly considered as potential biomarkers, Zn isotope compositions may reflect the original properties of Archean rocks more accurately than the isotope concentrations of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. The complex lithology of the Isua Supracrustal Belt, Greenland (3.81-3.70 Ga old), includes metabasalts, which can be divided into an ophiolite-like unit and a second unit known as ""Garbenschiefer,"" the geochemistry of which is reminiscent of boninites (15) and, hence, ties Isua supracrustals to an island arc environment. Serpentinites are also abundant in the metabasalt series (16) (17) (18) . Modern serpentinite samples from three representative geological settings also were investigated to provide a context for the Archean data. These are from (i) the magma-starved Gakkel Ridge (Arctic Ocean), which supplies well-serpentinized samples from a midocean ridge setting; (ii) Baja California and the Alps, which typify ophiolites obducted onto continents; and (iii) Mariana forearc serpentinite mud volcanoes (19) , which represent a subduction zone setting far from continental influence. The results are given in tabular form in SI Text and are plotted in Fig. 1 . The data are reported in the conventional δ 66 Zn notation, which represents the fractional deviation in parts per one thousand of the 66 Zn∕ 64 Zn sample ratio with respect to the ratio of the Lyon JMC Zn standard. It is now well established (12, 20, 21) The Kinetic Isotope Effect. In a number of cases, isotope fractionation is not the result of equilibrium processes, but rather the outcome of isotope-dependent reaction rates (known as the kinetic isotope effect or KIE). The role of KIE is well documented for hydrogen, carbon, and sulfur, especially in biologically mediated reactions (23) . It has, in particular, been invoked to account for δ 66 Zn values down to −0.17‰ in sphalerite from the Irish Midlands ore field (21), but the negative correlation between δ 66 Zn and δ 34 S also observed at this locality would require an inverse rate isotope effect on sulfur (23), which has not so far been documented. Furthermore, the lack of fractionation of sulfur isotopes in Isua hydrothermal sulfides (24, 25) with respect to planetary abundances argues against a strong kinetic effect for Zn, which is much heavier than S. Fractionation at Equilibrium. Recent theoretical work combining ab initio structure calculations and statistical mechanics (12, 13) is now allowing the role played by different species in solution in the fractionation of Zn isotopes to be determined over a broad range of temperatures. The ratio β of the partition functions for the 66 Zn-and 64 Zn-chloride, aqua ions, and sulfide isotopomers is very similar (Fig. 2) , which discounts these species as being responsible for major isotope fractionation within the fluid. At temperatures of 100-350°C and for solutions with carbonate and sulfate concentrations similar to that of seawater and other near-surface fluids, Zn 2þ and Zn chloride and sulfide complexes are the dominant Zn species in low-pH solutions (26) reacting with peridotites. Solutions are dominated by Zn 2þ at pH < 3, and, with increasing pH, by ZnðHSÞ 2 , ZnðHSÞ 3 − , and finally ZnSðHSÞ − . None of these species are expected to induce significant Zn isotope fractionation (Fig. 2) , and this is exactly what is observed in solutions and sulfide ores from the hot low-pH environments of black-smoker vent fields (27) . Progressive, Rayleigh-type leaching of sulfide can certainly account for the Zn depletion upon serpentinization but demands large and therefore unsupported isotope fractionation among S-rich species, typically >1‰ for 50% Zn removal. The Role of Sulfate. Because Zn sulfate complexes (12) stand out as particularly enriched in heavy isotopes, the effect of Zn complexation by sulfate in hydrothermal fluids must be considered. At ambient temperature and for sulfate concentration typical of modern seawater (28.6 mmol kg −1 ), Zn-sulfate complexes are subordinate, making up less than a few percent of the metallic ion and chloride complexes (12, 28). Seawater-like abundances are too low to induce a substantial isotopic shift of the sulfide species, and therefore of the sulfide minerals precipitated from the solutions, toward negative δ 66 Zn values. Sulfate usually is absent from black-smoker vent solutions but may be present at low concentration levels in white smoker fluids such as at the TAG (290°C) (27) and Lost City (40-70°C) (29) vent fields on the Mid-Atlantic ridge. However, correlated Mg excesses strongly suggest that the white smoker sulfate originates from subsurface mixing of seawater and hydrothermal fluids. Regardless, the limited data on white smoker fluids do not indicate anomalous Zn isotope compositions (27) . More generally, the range of variations of δ 66 Zn in sulfide ores from a wide variety of depositional environments (20, 21, 27, 30, 31) and, as shown in this study, also in Alpine ophiolites and Gakkel serpentinites, is quite narrow: The striking lack of negative δ 66 Zn values indicates that if Zn sulfate complexes were present in the parent hydrothermal fluid, they were not abundant enough to create major Zn isotope fractionation in hydrothermal solutions and sulfide deposits. Moreover, sulfate is widely thought to be missing from the Archean ocean (32) , and the dominant sulfur species in Isua serpentinites is sulfide, not sulfate. The Role of Carbonate. For want of a strong isotopic effect induced by sulfates, complexation by carbonate ions is a potential alternative. In seawater and in other hydrous fluids equilibrated under surface conditions, carbonate complexes are not abundant (13, 28) . High carbonate concentrations are unlikely along midocean ridges because there is no other source of CO 2 than mantle outgassing and even that CO 2 is largely reduced to methane by hydrogen. In addition, the pH of hydrothermal fluids is usually very low (<5) and under such conditions, H 2 CO 3 is not significantly dissociated. High carbonate concentrations can, however, be achieved at depths typical of arc environments, where subduction of carbonated basalts and calcareous sediments provides a potential source of CO 2 . Fuji et al. (13) considered the case for a CO 2 pressure of 5 × 10 6 Pa, which may be equated with a depth of 1 km below the seafloor and 15% CO 2 in the fluid. They concluded that, under these conditions and at temperatures <150°C, ZnCO 3 dominates Zn species for pH > 8. Thus, Zn in high-pH, medium-temperature fluids is largely in the form of carbonate complexes. Carbonate concentrations in hydrothermal fluids can be estimated from pH and alkalinity, with the caveat that precipitation of hydrothermal carbonates, for which there is plenty of observational support (33) , reduces alkalinity. In addition to the low δ 66 Zn observed, the widespread occurrence of carbonates at Isua (10) and in Mariana mud volcanoes away from the trench by >70 km (33, 34) , is a feature common to both sites and indicates that fluids in these localities were rich in carbonates. The presence of aragonite, a mineral species unstable under the conditions prevalent at the local seafloor and in Mariana serpentine mud volcanoes (34) , strongly supports decarbonation as a CO 2 source. The associated fluids have high alkalinity and H 2 S contents, and their carbon isotope compositions confirm that CO 2 does not derive from the atmosphere but from the breakdown of subducted carbonates (33, 35, 36) . Isua Serpentine Mud Volcanoes and the Origin of Life. The association of Isua serpentinites with carbonates and negative δ 66 Zn suggests that these rocks formed in conditions similar to those of the Mariana forearc, which is in line with previous conclusions about the Isua environment (15, 37) . Of all the parameters that this comparison with mud volcanoes (33, 37) entails, the temperature range of 100-300°C (19) and the high pH of fluids (9-12.6) are the most noticeable. Metamorphic transformation of ultramafic rocks requires massive CO 2 uptake (10), while boiling of CO 2 -rich fluids causes a sharp increase of the pH of hydrothermal solutions and promotes crystallization of calcite, ankerite, and dolomite (38) . Because, at depth, ZnCO 3 accounts for most of the Zn dissolved in hydrothermal fluids (13) , its δ 66 Zn is essentially unfractionated with respect to the bulk of the fluid. The igneous-like δ 66 Zn of Isua carbonate veins, therefore, are explained by precipitation from high-pH fluids percolating through serpentinites. In contrast, any sulfide precipitating from the same fluid must show markedly negative δ 66 Zn, which is what Isua and Mariana serpentinites do. In contrast, Isua talc schists and sphalerite veins contain Zn processed by hydrothermal transformation of peridotites at metamorphic temperatures around 500°C (10), causing their δ 66 Zn to be essentially unfractionated with respect to the igneous range and, hence, reflect δ 66 Zn of the fluid. The Isua environment is best interpreted as an equivalent of the Mariana forearc (19) with the Isua serpentinites being the Archean analogue of modern mud volcanoes. Modern active serpentine mud volcanoes are an unusual geological feature restricted to the Mariana and Izu-Bonin arc because the appropriate conditions at nonaccretionary, intraoceanic subduction zones are simply infrequent. The seismic structure of the IzuBonin underneath serpentine mud volcanoes shows low-strength serpentinite diapirs rising from the topmost layer of the mantle wedge above the subduction zone (39) . This mechanism is consistent with the field observations at Isua, where serpentinite bodies occur as tectonized podded structures within pillow basalt units of the ophiolite sequence. An interpretation as a sea floor mud volcano is thus consistent with the overall forearc geologic environment (15, 37) , with the composition of the ultramafic protolith of serpentines (40), and with the occurrence of a few δ 66 Zn values lower than the igneous average in Isua turbidites, for which a dacitic or andesitic protolith has been acknowledged (18) . An intriguing implication is that carbonate-rich seafloor lithologies were being subducted by 3.8 Ga. Our data favor the existence of warm, highly reducing hydrothermal fluids with high pH in early Archean serpentinite mud volcanoes. In a world endowed with plate tectonics but with smaller continental expanses than today, intraoceanic arcs such as the Mariana arc must have been common and, hence, also serpentine mud volcanoes. The presence of extremophilic Archaea on a Mariana forearc serpentinite mud volcano and their role in oxidizing methane from the ascending fluid to carbonate ion and organic carbon has been previously noted (41) . Forearcs have the added appeal that, in addition to serpentinization being a major source of hydrogen, subaerial volcanoes provide a proximal source of phosphorus, an indispensable nutrient for all forms of life, in a world where continents had not yet reached their modern surface areas (42) . Unlike midocean ridges, which are generally deepwater structures and not a source but a sink for phosphorus (43) , weathering of nearby aerial volcanic edifices from the arc system provides forearc vent field oceanic environments with a sustainable supply of phosphorus. The onset of plate tectonics, which presumably took place sometime during the Hadean, in addition to the existence of a water ocean with carbonate sedimentation and the resulting ocean-continent dichotomy, may have fostered the emergence of life on our planet in mud volcanoes. Samples analyzed from Isua are serpentinites, talc schists, veins of sphalerite (ZnS), metasomatic carbonates, and banded iron formations (BIF). Sulfides from two Isua serpentinites (samples 8c and 940094) and from Baja California sample M1 were purified by sieving and heavy-liquid separation. Analysis of Isua serpentinites by secondary electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) did not reveal the presence of sphalerite (Fig. 3) . Instead, the dominant sulfide mineral in Isua serpentinites is cobalt-rich pentlandite, a common mineral in Archean mafic and ultramafic rocks (44) . Pentlandite is also the sulfide mineral present in the M1 serpentinite. A metal phase was extracted from sample M1 using a hand magnet. The analytical techniques used for the chemical separation of Zn and for the isotopic analyses have been described elsewhere (45, 46) and are only repeated briefly here. Zinc was separated on Dowex AG1-X8 anion-exchange resin using HBr. Because ion-exchange resins fractionate Zn isotopes, full yields are required. By analyzing all the recovered fractions, we were able to demonstrate that the yield was better than 99%. All reagents were distilled in PFA stills. Zinc isotope ratios were measured by multiple collection inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) at ENS-Lyon on a Nu Plasma 500 HR. The samples were taken up in 0.05 N HNO 3 and run in wet plasma mode with free-aspiration using a glass microconcentric nebulizer (uptake rate: 80 μL∕ min) and a glass cyclonic spray chamber. Peak intensities (M ¼ 64, 66, 67, and 68) were measured in Faraday detectors in static mode with a spectral resolution of M∕ΔM ¼ 300. We used Cu NIST-SRM976 for doping the samples and an exponential mass fractionation law to correct for the instrumental mass bias. Samples were bracketed with standards, randomized, and the measurements duplicated. Sample solutions were diluted to match the concentration of the standard mixture (Zn 0.5 ppm-Cu 0.5 ppm). The total procedural blank including sample dissolution, chemical purification steps, and mass spectrometry measurements was 15 ng of Zn, which represents less than 0.5% of the total sample signal. The external reproducibility on δ 66 Zn based on repeated measurements of the Zn standard is 0.05‰. ",M.-L. Pons,2011,22006301,10.1073/pnas.1108061108

195185567,Deep-Sourced Fluids From a Convergent Margin Host Distinct Subseafloor Microbial Communities That Change Upon Mud Flow Expulsion,"Submarine mud volcanoes (MVs) along continental margins emit mud breccia and globally significant amounts of hydrocarbon-rich fluids from the subsurface, and host distinct chemosynthetic communities of microbes and macrofauna. Venere MV lies at 1600 m water depth in the Ionian Sea offshore Italy and is located in a forearc basin of the Calabrian accretionary prism. Porewaters of recently-extruded mud breccia flowing from its west summit are considerably fresher than seawater (10 PSU), high in Li+ and B (up to 300 and 8000 µM, respectively), and strongly depleted in K+ (3 km below seafloor. 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing were used to characterize microbial community composition and gene content within deep-sourced mud breccia flow deposits as they become exposed to seawater along a downslope transect of Venere MV. Summit samples showed consistency in microbial community composition. However, beta-diversity increased markedly in communities from downslope cores, which were dominated by methyl- and methanotrophic genera of Gammaproteobacteria. Sulfate and chloride concentrations were minor but significant contributors to variation in community composition. Metagenomic analyses revealed differences in relative abundances of predicted protein categories between Venere MV and other subsurface microbial communities, characterizing MVs as windows into distinct deep biosphere habitats.","Seafloor mud volcanoes (MVs) release tens of teragrams of methane annually into the overlying water column (Kopf, 2003; Milkov et al., 2004; Sauter et al., 2006; Sahling et al., 2009; Pape et al., 2014; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Methane forms the basis of seafloor chemosynthetic ecosystems and is oxidized aerobically or anaerobically through microbial metabolism (Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Van Dover et al., 2003; Knittel and Boetius, 2009) . MVs also expel fluids and mud breccia composed of clay-rich sediments with intermixed rock fragments, which can be sourced from several kilometers below the seafloor (Kopf, 2002; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . High fluxes of methane and upward-directed fluid flow at active seafloor MVs can restrict the delivery of relevant electron acceptors, such as oxygen or sulfate, into the seafloor. This limits microbial capacity for methane oxidation (Niemann et al., 2006; Boetius and Wenzhöfer, 2013) . Furthermore, anaerobic methanotrophs (ANMEs), the dominant consumers of methane in sediments (Reeburgh, 2007) , have doubling times of up to 7 months in vitro (Nauhaus et al., 2007) and take years to dominate microbial communities in situ (Ruff et al., 2018) . These limitations on biological methane removal support the argument that MVs represent potent sources of methane emission to the hydrosphere (Etiope and Milkov, 2004) . Microbial community changes in recently erupted muds of MVs are understood to occur on timescales of several years. In flows aged 1-2 years from the Håkon Mosby MV (Barents Sea), communities dominated by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria were identified as an initial successional stage (Ruff et al., 2018) . Diffusion of electron acceptors, such as oxygen and sulfate, into fresh flows can be inhibited by upward transport of MV-derived mud breccia and reduced fluids (Niemann et al., 2006) , but nevertheless is understood to drive a suite of redoxstratified microbial metabolisms that occur with increasing depth: aerobic oxidation of sulfide, sulfate reduction, anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM), and methanogenesis (Lin et al., 2018) . Whether microbial communities across active MVs respond similarly to fluid expulsion is not known, given the considerable heterogeneity of fluid sources and compositions (Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Additionally, how tectonically derived, deep-sourced MV fluids impact microbial community structure and potential activity remains poorly understood. Recently, the South Chamorro Seamount, a MV influenced by serpentinizing fluids derived from subduction at the Mariana convergent plate margin, has been described as an energetically favorable regime for microbial habitation: methanogens were recovered and identified, but methane from the fluids likely formed abiotically (Kawagucci et al., 2018) . Considering the numerous challenges associated with drilling-based studies, microbial characterizations of deep subsurface systems are often limited to sites of fluid discharge into shallower horizons, often referred to as ""windows to the deep biosphere"" (Deming and Baross, 1993; Lee et al., 2015; Woycheese et al., 2015; Hoshino et al., 2017; Krauze et al., 2017) . Venere MV, in the central Mediterranean, is located within the Calabrian Accretionary Prism (CAP) (Panieri et al., 2013; Ceramicola et al., 2014) , ∼50 km offshore Calabria at 1,600 m below seafloor (mbsf). Its active status is apparent through methane seepage along its caldera rim, the presence of visually distinguishable mud breccia deposits recently extruded from the western summit, and meter-scale changes in seafloor morphology documented by repeated bathymetric surveys between 2014 and 2016 (Loher et al., 2018a,c) . In mud breccia from the western summit, porewater chloride depletions to 20% of seawater values are consistent with smectite-illite clay dehydration reactions, and hydrocarbons show a thermogenic signature. These support fluid origin temperatures of 60-150 • C that correspond to a depth between 3.5 and 7.5 km below the seafloor (Loher et al., 2018c) , which may be within the 5-7 km sediment column overlying the basement of the CAP (Ferrucci et al., 1991; Voogd et al., 1992) . Given that sedimentation rates at Venere MV and the nearby Crotone-Spartivento forearc basins range from 0.17 to 0.26 mm/year (Ceramicola et al., 2014; Loher et al., 2018a) , the maximum ages of these recently extruded deposits are likely only a few years. Using a suite of geochemical, 16S amplicon, and metagenomic sequence data, we sought to characterize microbial communities inhabiting deep-sourced mud breccia at Venere MV and to document changes in community composition associated with extrusion of flow deposits from the summit as they began to entrain seawater. We hypothesized that (1) both deepsourced fluids and seawater-derived electron acceptors such as sulfate would exert a notable influence on microbial community structure; (2) methanotrophic taxa would be found in methanerich mud breccia with increasing distance downslope of the Venere MV summit; and (3) gene content from MVs would be distinct from that of microbial communities inhabiting other subsurface environments.  Exposed mud breccia deposits at the western summit of the coneshaped Venere MV (Figure 1) were visually investigated during multiple remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives on MARUM cruise M112 aboard the R/V METEOR from November 29 to December 10, 2014. The most recently extruded deposits at the summit were gray in color and showed a rough surface texture, in contrast to deposits from previous mud breccia outflows, which were yellowish and characterized by a smooth texture. Sedimentological interpretation of cores from both flow deposits identified the material as mud breccia without any noticeable hemipelagic cover, and coring confirmed that the spatial extent of the flows extended up to 1.6 km downslope (Loher et al., 2018a,c) . Areas of methane seepage were hydroacoustically detected in the water column just below the western summit and at several locations around the caldera rim ( Figure 1B) where the release of gas bubbles from the seafloor was visually confirmed (see initial descriptions by Loher et al., 2018b,c) . For this study we targeted sites located at the summit, where freshened mud breccia had most recently been extruded. Gravity cores and a series of ROV-guided push cores obtained along a downslope transect of the mud flow deposits were collected and compared with a gravity core (GeoB19236-1) from gas seep site 1 ( Figure 1B) . Seep site 1 is located in the MV periphery on the rim of the caldera, where methane discharge is evident from hydroacoustic data and chemosynthetic communities typical of cold seep sites have been described (Loher et al., 2018b) . This gravity core consists of mud breccia overlain by 2 cm of fine showing Eastern and Western summits, ring faults along the caldera rim, five sites of observed gas seepage (orange stars), and locations of cores at seep site 1 and at a non-seep reference site to the southeast. Data from Loher et al. (2018a) . (C) Zoomed-in view of the Venere MV western summit showing locations of gravity and push cores (circles and diamonds, respectively) collected for microbiological sampling. The extent of two recently extruded mud breccia flow deposits are shown with older deposits outlined in gray, underlying younger deposits delineated in white. Maps are modified with permission from Loher et al. (2018a) . sandy sediment. In addition, a reference minicore (GeoB19279-3) retrieved southeast of the MV area ( Figure 1B ) was used as a background control. This core consisted of fine sand and hemipelagic sediment, lacking mud breccia or sediments affected by fluid seepage. During this expedition, gravity core sediments were collected using a strategy developed to minimize the time between recovery and sampling of gas hydrate-rich sediments (Pape et al., 2010) . Instead of using the common PVC liners, the core barrel was lined with a flexible polyethylene bag (film thickness 0.2 mm, R. Losch, Germany). Upon core recovery, the bag containing the sediment was removed from the barrel. The clear plastic allows for rapid inspection of the material. In contrast to conventional thickwalled PVC liners, the sediment can be sampled immediately by cutting through the bag with a sterile knife. Porewater, gas, and microbiology samples were collected less than 20 min after cores arrived on deck. Minicores and push cores were transferred to the ship's laboratory and sampled in intervals of several centimeters by extruding the sediments from the plastic tube with a piston. Samples for DNA extractions and methane concentrations were collected from the same minicores and push cores, while parallel cores were sampled for porewater. Whole round core samples for DNA extraction were sliced using an ethanol-sanitized spatula and transferred to Whirl-Pak bags (VWR, Radnor, PA, United States) before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 • C. To determine porewater methane concentrations, 3 ml of bulk sediment was transferred to a 20 ml glass vial filled with 5 ml NaOH, leaving 12 ml headspace. Rhizons (Seeberg-Elverfeldt et al., 2005) were used to draw porewater samples into acid-washed syringes over a period of 10 h. Porewaters were collected at room temperature, because bottom waters measured 18 • C. Porewater samples for cation measurements were transferred to 1.5 ml acid-washed tubes and acidified with 20 µl ultrapure concentrated (65%) HNO 3 . Salinity was measured onboard with a salinometer (Krüss Optronic, Hamburg, Germany) with a ±0.1 PSU precision, and calibrated daily against dilution of IAPSO standards with salinities of 9.989, 29.968, 34.993, and 38.022 PSU. Alkalinity was determined onboard by diluting a 0.5 ml porewater sample with 9.5 ml distilled water and stirring constantly in an open beaker while titrating with aliquots of a 0.01 M HCl standard until pH decreased below 4, normally between 3.9 and 3.5. The pH electrode (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, United States) was calibrated with buffers of pH 4, 7, and 10. Alkalinity was calculated using the equation: where v HCl is the volume (in ml) of HCl added to final pH, c HCl is the molar concentration of HCl, pH start and pH final are the initial and final pH readings, v 0 is the initial sample volume in ml, and f H is the activity coefficient of H + in seawater, taken as 0.79 (Culberson and Pytkowicz, 1973) . Dissolved methane in bulk sediment was analyzed onboard using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) equipped with a capillary column connected with a flame ionization detector, following the same procedure as described in Pape et al. (2010) . Reported concentrations of dissolved methane are ex situ concentrations, uncorrected for sediment temperature (Bunsen coefficient) and porosity. The high spatial heterogeneity of methane supply in the marine subsurface prevents an accurate determination of in situ porewater methane concentration, unless cores are analyzed at pressure (Milkov et al., 2003; Pape et al., 2011) . Pressure cores from the Venere MV summit yielded average methane concentrations of 321 mmol/l, above the solubility of 120 mmol/l (Loher et al., 2018c) , and two orders of magnitude higher than ex situ values reported here. This agrees with previous observations where ∼1% of methane by volume was recovered from gravity cores (Paull and Ussler, 2001 ). These loss estimates are corroborated by strong degassing and observed ""moussy"" textures of mud breccia recovered from gravity cores at the summit flow and at seep site 1 (Bohrmann et al., 2015) . However, where our methane concentrations approach the solubility limit atmospheric pressure (∼1 mmol/l) we are not able to determine whether these measurements reflect in situ concentrations, or whether degassing occurred fully. Sulfate and chloride concentrations were measured by ion chromatography using a Metrohm 882 Compact IC plus (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) on a Metrosep A Supp 5 column. Analytical errors below 0.4% were reported for both ions. Linear interpolation was used to approximate chloride, sulfate, and alkalinity concentrations at depths where samples for microbiology were taken. Lithium and boron samples were diluted 1:50, and potassium diluted 1:100, with 1% quartz-distilled nitric acid and run on a Leeman Labs Prodigy ICP-OES ion chromatograph using a radial viewing mode. IAPSO seawater and in-house solution standards were run every 11 samples and used to evaluate instrumental accuracy and precision. Detection limits were determined according to EPA method 200.7 (Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, 1996) . The limit of detection for potassium was 0.42 mM, while the limit of quantitation was 0.61 mM. High standards for lithium and boron were 10.2 and 327 µM, respectively. DNA was extracted using a modified sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-based DNA extraction protocol (Zhou et al., 1996) . Other DNA extraction methods, such as Mobio PowerSoil kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), or those detailed in Lever et al. (2015) produced much lower yields of genomic DNA that amplified less consistently. DNA extraction buffer was prepared as described in Zhou et al. (1996) and filtered through a 0.2-µm syringe filter. In a clean laminar flow hood, 0.3 g sediment, 550 µl extraction buffer, and 50 µl 20% 0.2 µl filtered-SDS were placed into autoclaved 1.5 ml internally threaded cryogenic vials (VWR, Radnor, PA, United States). Upon thawing, vials were vortexed at high speed for 5 min using a vortex affixed with a bead-beading adaptor (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Vials were sonicated in a roomtemperature water bath sonicator at 40 kHz (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) in two pulses of 30 s each, separated by 90 s, and then incubated in a 65 • C water bath for 1 h, inverting to resuspend flocculated sediment every 15-20 min. Vials were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to pellet sediment. Supernatants were combined with equal volumes of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) in 2 ml heavy phase lock gel tubes (Quantabio, Beverly, MA, United States) and continuously inverted for 4 min. Tubes were spun down at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and aqueous layers carefully transferred to clean tubes with 2.5× the aqueous volume of ethanol and 1 µl glycoblue coprecipitant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). DNA was precipitated at −20 • C for 2 h, and then pelleted by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 • C. Supernatant was carefully removed by pipetting and residual liquid was left to evaporate for 10-15 min. A subsequent salt wash was performed by adding 500 µl cold 70% ethanol and then centrifuging and removing the supernatant as before. Tubes were then placed in a Savant vacuum concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) at 55 • C for up to 10 min to evaporate any remaining liquid. DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 µl nuclease-free water and stored at −20 • C. Two DNA extraction blanks were conducted: one without any added sediment, and another with sediment that had been baked in an oven at 175 • C for 2 h. DNA was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer and High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) after extraction. 16S amplicons were prepared following the Earth Microbiome Project Illumina protocol. V4 regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified in triplicate 25 µl reactions using universal 515-forward and 806-reverse primers (Caporaso et al., 2011) modified with dual-indexed Illumina sequencing adapters (Kozich et al., 2013) . The thermal cycling protocol of Caporaso et al. (2011) was followed without modifications. After confirming amplification with agarose gel electrophoresis, triplicate PCR products were pooled and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In addition to the DNA extraction blanks, a sample without any added template DNA was amplified and purified as a PCR negative control. Amplicon concentrations were quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) using the Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity assay kit and pooled in equimolar amounts. Illumina MiSeq V2 paired-end 250 bp sequencing was performed at the Oregon State University Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB). 16S amplicon sequences were processed with version 1.39.3 of mothur (Schloss et al., 2009 ) following an established pipeline (Kozich et al., 2013) . Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level and taxonomically classified using version 128 of the SILVA database (Quast et al., 2013) . Singleton OTUs and contaminant genera were removed (for details on potential contaminants, see the section ""Results""). Communities were rarefied to 356 reads, and relative abundances and metrics of alpha diversity (richness and Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) were then calculated. To compare beta diversity, a tree file containing the most abundant sequence from each of the 11,572 OTUs was constructed with Clearcut (Evans et al., 2006) . A dissimilarity matrix was then calculated using weighted Unifrac distances (Lozupone et al., 2007) . Principal coordinates (PCO) analysis was conducted in PRIMER7 (Clarke and Warwick, 2001 ) from the community dissimilarity matrix and a Euclideannormalized environmental data matrix containing porewater chloride, methane, and sulfate concentrations corresponding to all samples. Distance-based linear modeling was used to evaluate the influence of these variables on community structure. Differences in community structure among sites and cores were evaluated using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) (Clarke, 1993) . Metastats (White et al., 2009 ) was used to determine whether individual OTUs showed patterns of differential abundance between communities based on chloride, methane, or sulfate concentrations and summit mud flow ages. Metagenomic DNA from samples was extracted using the procedure described above, with modifications to account for the increased sediment volumes. 8.4 g from sample GeoB19242-15 at 2-3 cm, 4.8 g from sample GeoB19263-1 at 48-52 cm, and 31.2 g from sample GeoB19263-1 at 267-270 cm were used. Volumes of extraction reagents were scaled up according to sediment masses. Samples were placed in 15 or 50 ml conical tubes, and centrifuging steps were carried out at 4,500 × g for 10 min when pelleting sediment and 1,500 × g for 5 min when extracting with phenol-chloroformisoamyl alcohol. Samples were precipitated at 4 • C for 12 h with 0.6 volume isopropanol and 0.1 volume sodium acetate in 2 ml tubes. Pellets were pooled, desalted with ethanol as described previously, resuspended in nuclease-free water, and DNA was then purified with a Norgen CleanAll DNA/RNA cleanup and concentration kit (Norgen Biotek, Thorold, Ontario, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions for genomic DNA (>10,000 bp). Metagenomic library construction and sequencing was conducted at the Josephine Bay Paul Center Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, MA, United States, using an established protocol available online 1 . To add to the three samples described here, fastq files from seven additional metagenomes derived from recent mud flows of the Håkon Mosby MV (Ruff et al., 2018) were downloaded from NCBI and analyzed in parallel. The ends of low-quality fastq sequences were removed using version 1.0-r72-dirty of the seqtk trimfq tool 2 . Paired reads were assembled with Megahit v1.1.1-2-g02102e1 (Li et al., 2015) and annotated in ShotMAP v1.1 (Nayfach et al., 2015) against the clusters of orthologous group (COG) protein family database (Galperin et al., 2015) using a classification threshold score of 42.8 and a coverage-based abundance calculation strategy. This classification method was more accurate than other pre-2018 pipelines in quantifying gene family abundances using the COG database (Franzosa et al., 2018) . Alpha diversity statistics were obtained across all three Venere and seven Håkon Mosby MV metagenomes using the ShotMAP script compare_shotmap_samples.pl. Percent abundances of reads annotated to each COG functional category were summed across samples. Reads annotated to multiple COG categories were omitted and percent abundances re-normalized to allow for comparison against other publicly available metagenomes from subsurface ecosystems annotated using the COG database. This information was obtained from the MG-RAST and IMG/M metagenome databases (Markowitz et al., 2014; Keegan et al., 2016) . To investigate microbial community changes during the extrusion and downslope transport of recently exposed, chloride-depleted mud breccia originating from the marine subsurface and the influence of seawater entrainment in such sediments, we collected samples for geochemical and microbial analyses from Venere MV offshore Calabria, Italy ( Figure 1A) . In the following, we describe results of DNA extractions/quality controls, geochemical trends that characterize Venere MV summit flow deposits, and then integrated geochemical and microbial community observations. We finally compare gene content from Venere MV metagenomes with that of another marine MV and additional marine subsurface environments. Table 1 includes relevant information from all cores organized by their sampling locations. Yield and Controls for DNA and 16S Amplicon Sequence Analysis DNA extraction yields from summit mud breccia sediments ranged across several orders of magnitude, from <0.12 to 145 ng per g bulk sediment. Yields were lowest in samples taken from depths below 40 cm in the summit gravity core, and higher in surface samples <10 cm below seafloor (cmbsf) and throughout gravity core GeoB19263 taken near seep site 3 just below the western summit ( Figure 1C) . Genomic DNA yields from push cores of the newer summit flow deposit (GeoB19242) were mostly below 2 ng per g, and push cores from the older flow further downslope showed increasing yields with distance from the summit (Supplementary Figure S1) . Mud breccia samples with added Escherichia coli genomic DNA recovered only 8.3% of the DNA compared to extractions with gDNA and no mud breccia. Therefore, in addition to the evident low biomass within these samples, sorption of DNA to clayey materials also likely reduced recovery. Faint amplification was observed in one DNA extraction blank, but not in another with baked sediment added to it, which suggests the mud breccia may contain PCR inhibitors. In addition, several samples intended for 16S amplicon sequencing failed to amplify. The low amounts of extracted DNA recovered from Venere MV samples necessitated extra scrutiny in identifying and removing potential contaminant sequences. Nineteen bacterial genera present at higher abundances in the three blanks than in 68 samples (α = 0.05) were removed, as were four genera previously identified as common laboratory or reagent contaminants in low-biomass samples (Salter et al., 2014) . The removed genera (listed in Supplementary Table S1) comprised six bacterial phyla and 81% of the sequences identified in blanks, but only 2.7% of Venere MV communities overall. Bacterial and Archaeal genera that were plotted in figures include the 13 genera that comprised >1% of all sequences in the dataset, and an additional six genera that were each over 0.3% of all sequences and were over 10% of any single community. Altogether, these 19 genera made up 72.5% of all sequences in the dataset. Gravity and push cores (GeoB19245-1 and 19258-15, respectively) collected at the Venere MV summit and downslope flow deposits show elevated concentrations of lithium and boron, and a depletion in potassium at depths just centimeters below seafloor (Figure 2) . These contrast markedly with trends seen in the gravity core from seep site 1 (GeoB19236-1), where these constituents reflect concentrations found in bottom waters. In samples from Venere MV summit flow deposits where microbial community samples were collected, porewater chloride and sulfate concentrations show a positive linear relationship (Figure 3 ). Chloride decreases with depth at the summit ( Figure 4A ). Because chloride changes occur at depths where lithium, boron, and potassium also deviate from seawater values, we interpret the coinciding decreases in chloride as a distinct geochemical transition between deep-sourced and seawater-influenced end-members.  Results are organized according to sampling areas or depths. First we show geochemical and microbial community data from gravity cores of Venere MV summit mud flow deposits and methane seep site 1, an area uninfluenced by recent mud breccia extrusion. These cores reach over 1 mbsf. We then present comparable data from push cores from the summit flow deposits and a reference site (without evidence of mud breccia extrusion or fluid seepage) that detail depths up to 20 cmbsf. Porewaters freshen markedly in gravity cores from the Venere MV summit and in cores GeoB19263-1 and GeoB19276-1, collected 80 and 150 m downslope along the mud flow ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, the site 1 seep core (GeoB19236-1) shows no evidence of porewater freshening even though sediments are mainly comprised of mud breccia. The deepsourced fluids in summit gravity cores are highly alkaline (40-60 mM) and depleted in sulfate, as are fluids from the site 1 seep ( Figure 4B ). Low sulfate/chloride ratios in gravity core samples from mud flow deposits downslope of the summit suggest the occurrence of microbial sulfate reduction (Figure 3) . The accumulation of methane below the sulfate reduction zone at seep site 1 ( Figure 4C) shows a sulfate-methane transition zone that suggests the presence of AOM. Methane concentrations in summit gravity cores range from 2 to 4 mM, but do not decrease with depth as conspicuously. Microbial communities at all depths of the summit gravity core show consistent relative abundances of Atribacteria, ANME-1b, and Anaerolineaceae ( Figure 4D ). Other methanotrophs are present in two cores 80 and 150 m downslope of the summit: ANME-2a-2b in GeoB19263-1, and several genera of aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria at 24 cmbsf in GeoB19276-1. Clostridia and Desulfobacteraceae, potential sulfur cyclers, are also more abundant in communities from downslope gravity cores. In contrast, the seep site 1 microbial community shows high abundances of several ANME clades throughout the core. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) SEEP-SRB1, which often associate with ANME to mediate AOM (Knittel et al., 2003) , are also present in high abundances. ROV-guided push cores taken from Venere MV summit and downslope from the mud breccia extrusion site also show significant freshening in porewater with chloride values of 200 mM measured only a few centimeters below seafloor, whereas the reference minicore GeoB19279-3 does not ( Figure 5A ). All cores, with the exception of the reference, show decreasing sulfate and increasing alkalinity with depth ( Figure 5B ). Methane concentrations in mud flow deposit cores were higher closer to the summit, but still exceeded 1 mM at 150 m downslope and generally did not drop off with depth ( Figure 5C ). Methane in the reference core porewater was detected in nanomolar amounts. As in the gravity cores, push core communities contained high abundances of Atribacteria and ANME-1b, particularly in core GeoB19242-12 near the summit ( Figure 5D ). However, methylotrophic Gammaproteobacteria were the most dominant community members in cores from the older mudflow sequence downslope of the summit. The top four OTUs from this group matched most closely to the genus Methylomonas, which are obligately aerobic type 1 methanotrophs capable of fixing nitrogen (Lidstrom, 2006) . High abundances of an OTU belonging to Ammonifex and most similar to Thermodesulfitimonas autotrophica, an anaerobic chemolithoautotroph (Slobodkina et al., 2017) , were present at similar or slightly deeper depths. The most abundant OTU, a marine group 1 methanotroph, is most closely related to Methylomonas methanica (Boden et al., 2011) . Bacterial and archaeal genera present in high abundance in summit flow communities were not present in shallow sediments of the reference site, which instead contained high abundances of Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota ( Figure 5D ). However, these communities were characterized by much higher alpha diversity than those from all other cores, with Chao1 indices of 606-782 compared to 153 or lower in mud breccia communities. A PCO ordination analysis was used to examine patterns of beta diversity among Venere MV microbial communities and their relation to porewater geochemical parameters (Figure 6 ). Two PCOs captured 54.1% of the community variance. Communities from Venere MV summit deposits showed the highest betadiversity, though a high degree of similarity was observed in communities from the summit gravity core. ANOSIM tests indicated differences in community structure between samples from older and younger summit mud breccia deposits, and between most cores (34 of 55 pairwise comparisons). However, when summit gravity core communities were reclassified as a distinct group instead of as younger mud flows, this difference disappeared (Supplementary Table S2 ). For this reason, and because they showed high similarity, summit gravity core communities were colored separately on the ordination (Figure 6 ). It is noteworthy that communities from seep site 1 and from a reference core were distinct from those inhabiting mud breccia flow deposits at or near the summit (Supplementary Table S2 ). Communities from these deposits recently extruded from kilometer-scale depths may require time to adapt to physical and/or geochemical conditions of a shallower marine subsurface environment. Porewater sulfate, methane, and chloride concentrations were all significant drivers of community structure (p ≤ 0.006), and, respectively, accounted for 8.6, 7.6, and 6.4% of the difference in community structure (22.6% of the total). Methane and sulfate vectors point in opposite directions on the PCO (Figure 6) , reiterating contrasting observations of methane-rich, sulfate-depleted fluids in summit and seep site 1 gravity cores compared to surface mud breccia deposits which have begun to entrain sulfate-rich seawater (Figures 4, 5) . On the other hand, direct trends between porewater chloride and community composition are not conveyed in the ordination (Figure 6) , which is likely obscured by the high beta-diversity among summit flow communities. Several abundant OTUs in Venere MV summit flows are present in communities at different abundances based on mud flow age, and methane or chloride concentrations (Supplementary Figure S2) . One aerobic methanotroph belonging to Methyloccocales was more dominant in older summit flow communities. Another, classified to Marine Methylotrophic Group 1, constituted nearly a quarter of the communities where methane was below 0.5 mM, suggesting it was active in removing methane from pore fluids. Atribacteria dominated methane-rich sediments, and two OTUs belonging to Desulfobacteraceae were more abundant in older deposits where methane concentrations still exceeded 2 mM. ANME-1b was the only OTU showing a preference for deeply sourced fluids with low chlorinity (Supplementary Figure S2C) . This ANME was presumably dead, dormant, or outcompeted by other populations as mud breccia was extruded from the Venere MV summit and exposed to a more oxidizing environment. Metagenomes were analyzed from three samples at Venere MV, a surface mud flow deposit near the Venere MV summit, and 50 and 267 cmbsf from gravity core GeoB 19263-1, 80 m downslope. COG category abundances from Venere MV metagenomes were similar to those of seven others from Håkon Mosby MV, off Norway in the Barents Sea (Ruff et al., 2018) . The diversity of COGs among all MV metagenomes did not vary significantly. However, these two MVs together showed a distinctly different composition of COG categories than metagenomes belonging to hydrothermal vent, basaltic crust, or sediment ecosystems (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Supplementary Table S4 contains additional information for other metagenomes compared, which either displayed COG category information in-text or online in MG-RAST or IMG/M databases. In particular, MV metagenomes showed higher abundances of reads classified to defense mechanisms (to combat viral attack) than the other three environments (Supplementary Figure S3) . In addition, higher content in the categories of cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, translation, and posttranslational modification came at the expense of energy production/conversion and amino acid transport and metabolism. These broad-level differences may hint at specialized adaptations that allow life to persist in a distinct deep subsurface environment. Mud volcanoes emit large quantities of methane into the oceans, contain fluids generated at depths from clay dewatering and convergent margin activity, and host methane-oxidizing chemosynthetic communities (Corselli and Basso, 1996; Fitts and Brown, 1999; Kopf, 2002 Kopf, , 2003 Niemann et al., 2006) . In this study, we sought to investigate linkages between methane, deepsourced fluids, and microbial community structure and gene content at a subseafloor MV to an unprecedented extent by characterizing microbial communities in freshly exposed mud breccia deposits at Venere MV within a geochemical context as they were extruded onto the seafloor. First we consider the geochemical nature of the deep fluids, then follow with a discussion of microbial gene content and metabolic potential, and FIGURE 7 | Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of COG functional category percent abundances among publicly available metagenomes from diverse marine subsurface environments.

Where indicated, numbers at ends of labels represent depths below seafloor in meters. Additional information is supplied in Supplementary Table S4. finally place microbial community changes within the context of this transitional environment. As interpreted previously by Loher et al. (2018c) , the decrease in pore water chloride at Venere MV summit and mud flow deposits appears to be the result of the upward advection and transport of deep-sourced fluids, which appear to be generated not from gas hydrate decomposition but by smectite-illite clay mineral dehydration reactions (Loher et al., 2018c) , which occur at temperatures between 60 and 150 • C (Kastner et al., 2014) . The estimated regional heat flow gradient of 0.020 • C/m and the thermogenic hydrocarbon signature documented at the summit of Venere MV point to a fluid source at depths of 3-7.5 km below the seafloor (Loher et al., 2018c) . Boron enrichment in pore waters typically results from clay particle desorption during mineral dehydration reactions or leaching from basalts at high (>150 • C) temperatures (Seyfried et al., 1984; Kopf and Deyhle, 2002) , processes which have repeatedly been documented by fluid analyses along convergent margin subduction zones (You et al., 1993 (You et al., , 1995 . Lithium may also be released from sediments and basalts at temperatures ranging from 51 to 350 • C (You et al., 1995; James et al., 2003) , which may point to fluid sources located deeper than smectite-illite transition depths, as in MVs from the Nankai accretionary wedge (Nishio et al., 2015) . At the Venere MV summit, porewater boron concentrations of up to 13 mM rank among the highest ever documented at MVs, which typically range below 5 mM (Kopf and Deyhle, 2002) . Porewater lithium values of several hundred micromolars at Venere MV are comparable in magnitude to the MVs of the Barbados convergent margin (Martin et al., 1996) , and exceed those of the Kumano MVs of the Nankai wedge (Nishio et al., 2015) . Boron and lithium enrichments have also been noted to infer fluid mobilization depths of 4-6 km below seafloor in the active Carmen MV in the western Mediterranean (López-Rodríguez et al., 2019) . Potassium concentrations below 1 mM in Venere MV pore fluids are without precedent, though values as low as 2.4 mM in MVs of the Barbados margin have been interpreted as incorporation of K + into the clay mineral illite during smectite diagenesis (Martin et al., 1996) . This phenomenon has been noted at other sites including the Ulleung basin (Kim et al., 2016) and Canadian Shield sedimentary deposits (Bottomley and Clark, 2004) . Together, the magnitudes of chloride and potassium depletions at Venere MV point toward considerable fluid generation from clay dewatering during smectite-illite clay mineral transformations at depth. Below 1 m, porewater chloride ( Figure 4A) , potassium, boron, and lithium (Figure 2) in the Venere MV summit gravity core do not change appreciably. This suggests that below this horizon, there is no admixture with seawater but that active upward advection of deeply sourced (>3 km) fluids maintained their highly altered fluid composition to depths as shallow as 50 cmbsf. The nonlinear nature of these profiles (Figures 4A,B) evinces a system out of steady-state conditions, wherein seawater has only begun to diffuse downward into the mud breccia to depths of 50 cm or less. To compare microbial communities with the potential nature of the fluid regime, we use low chlorinity (<200 mM) in Venere MV summit and mud flow deposits as a proxy for deepsourced fluids. Despite the considerable geochemical transition from deep-sourced to seawater-influenced fluids in Venere MV flow deposits, chloride concentration only explained 6.4% of the difference among microbial communities. This would suggest that communities in recently extruded mud breccia are affected only minimally by these deep fluids, or have not yet had the time to shift as they begin to mix with seawater and electron acceptors therein. Only one OTU, an ANME-1b, changed noticeably with chloride concentration (Supplementary Figure S2C) ; it may thus be inactive or outcompeted by other taxa considering that doubling times for anaerobic methane oxidizers are over a month, and that years may be required before they become dominant within communities (Girguis et al., 2005; Ruff et al., 2018) . Despite the low influence of deep fluids on community structure, clear patterns are noted in mud flow deposits with increasing distance from the extrusion site. The increased percent abundances of methyl-and methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Ammonifex, and unclassified Desulfobacteraceae (Figures 4, 5) likely reflect new growth instead of a decline in actual numbers of competing taxa. Higher abundances of these taxa in downslope cores may reflect proliferation in response to changes in physical conditions (such as changes in temperature and pressure), geochemical conditions (presence and nature of electron acceptors), and time after mud flow expulsion from the center conduit, which may allow methane to diffuse upward through flow deposits and possibly into the water column. Microbial groups present in mud breccia extruded from the main conduit at the western cone of Venere MV presumably have adaptations to high temperature environments, or are able to persist in a dormant state under considerable energy limitation for extended timescales (Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013) . Cell generation times in sediments can increase at least two orders of magnitude below sulfate-methane transition zones (Starnawski et al., 2017) . The high degree of similarity between Venere MV communities throughout summit gravity core samples across the transition from deep-sourced to seawater-influenced fluids (Figures 4, 6) suggests that community changes do not occur instantly, and that the few taxa therein represent an end-member deep-sourced microbial community signature from within the MV conduit. Thermophilic ANME-1 clades have been described at hydrothermal vents and sediments impacted by hydrothermal fluids (Teske et al., 2002; Brazelton et al., 2006) , while Atribacteria are understood to disperse through mud volcanism (Hoshino et al., 2017) . The functional and genomic potential within the class Anaerolineae is still poorly understood, but some members are considered to be anaerobic fermenters that show evidence of cellulolytic activity (Xia et al., 2016) . Additional investigations are needed to determine whether community members present in deep-sourced mud breccia constitute live and potentially active populations. Currently, only members of the bacterial phylum Firmicutes are understood to form endospores (Fritze, 2004) , and Clostridia are the only class of these present in significant amounts at Venere MV communities. In particular, Thermoanaerobacteraceae and Ammonifex contain hyperthermophilic chemolithotrophic members isolated from hot springs that employ hydrogen or formate as electron donors and several sulfur compounds as acceptors (Miroshnichenko et al., 2008; Slobodkina et al., 2017) . These groups are most prevalent in shallow push core sediments where sulfate is present (Figure 5 ), yet the sulfate in these deposits is consistent with a mixing ratio with deep-sourced fluids and seawater as end members, suggesting an absence of ongoing sulfate reduction (Figure 3) . Microbial communities at MVs display high variability, though several keystone OTUs involved in methane and sulfur metabolism occur in these systems, particularly members of ANME, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria (Pachiadaki and Kormas, 2013) . Methanotrophic communities are restricted to surface sediments at the center of the active Håkon Mosby MV, which is characterized by a dynamic gas hydrate system (Pape et al., 2011) . ANMEs at Håkon Mosby MV are active in peripheral zones, where lower rates of deeply sourced fluid flow allow sulfate to permeate deeper into the sediment column (Niemann et al., 2006) . Studies of recent deposits at this location identified additional populations similar to those found at Venere MV, including Atribacteria and Chloroflexi associated with the subsurface conduit, and sulfate reducers and sulfur oxidizers in surface-exposed mud deposits (Ruff et al., 2018) . In addition, high abundances of Methylococcales (up to 20%) have been found to characterize communities of active MVs in the Mediterranean compared to inactive ones nearby (Coelho et al., 2016) . In contrast to active methanogens described at other MVs (Lazar et al., 2012) or deep biologically sourced methane described at other accretionary margins (Ijiri et al., 2018) , the low abundance of sequences belonging to canonical methanogens (0.7%) and thermogenic isotopic signatures of hydrocarbons at the summit of Venere MV suggests that microbial methane production is negligible. Based on preliminary comparisons with other marine subsurface ecosystems, the distinct gene content in MV metagenomes (Figure 7) likely reflects functional adaptations in community members that may not be endemic to MVs, but are nevertheless highly abundant therein. Elevated percentages of defense mechanism COGs in MV metagenomes are suggestive of diversified adaptations against viral attack (Makarova et al., 2013) , though viral diversity may select against certain defense elements (such as CRISPR-Cas systems) from the genome (Weinberger et al., 2012) . Viruses can outnumber bacterial and archaeal cells in subsurface environments by one to two orders of magnitude (Engelhardt et al., 2014; Nigro et al., 2017) , and as such, their influence on microbial community dynamics and evolution within MVs should be topics of future investigation. Compared to basalts and hydrothermal environments, the higher percentages of COGs related to translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis in MVs suggest smaller average genome sizes (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004) . The gain, loss, or modification of cell membrane genes in populations of Sulfurovum has been implicated to be adaptations to hydrothermal environments (Anderson et al., 2017) ; these forces could also explain high percent abundances of cell membrane COGs in MVs. With the exception of amino acids, the similar abundances of metabolic COG categories between MVs and other subsurface environments could imply that metabolic gene content across subsurface environments is somewhat homogenous at a broad level of classification. Further analyses of MV metagenomes should continue characterizing metabolisms involved in biogeochemical cycles, and pay particular attention to specific adaptations to temperature, pressure, or the unique geochemistry of deep-sourced fluids these microbial genomes could hold. Microbial community changes have been characterized across transitional subsurface environments in many settings. Increased diversity observed in aging basalt outcrops has been explained by geochemical changes, such as the accretion of organic matter and allochthonous minerals, that could support a wide variety of metabolisms (Lee et al., 2015) . In contrast (Woycheese et al., 2015) , observed a decrease in diversity in serpentinizing seep fluids after they were exposed to the atmosphere and a select few genera became dominant. It took around 2 years for alpha diversity to increase in freshly exposed muds at Håkon Mosby MV, despite available electron donors and acceptors (Ruff et al., 2018) . Patterns of alpha diversity in Venere MV mud flow deposits are not apparent, and thus may reflect a similar time dependency. The observation that Venere MV mud flow microbial community composition was influenced by methane and sulfate availability is suggestive of energy limitation, which has also been found to structure communities in deep sediments of the South China Sea (Graw et al., 2018) . Preliminary IODP data from Expedition 370 found that subsurface temperatures above 65 • C can drastically restrict cell numbers (Heuer et al., 2017) . Incomplete heat flow data from shallow Venere MV deposits prevented us from determining the influence of temperature on community composition. Decreasing pressure as fluidized muds are transported upward may represent another physical factor that potentially influences microbial community composition (Bartlett et al., 2007; Myka et al., 2017) . Differences observed between communities from the Venere MV summit gravity core and nearby downslope deposits may indicate additional geochemical or physical forces at play, though community assembly may be stochastic to some extent (Stegen et al., 2012) . Similar to microbial communities in extruded mud breccia flows of the Håkon Mosby MV (Ruff et al., 2018) , we observed increases in SRB (Desulfobacteraceae and SEEP-SRB1) with time and distance from the MV summit, mirroring trends in genomic DNA concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1) . These changes were particularly evident in cores with high porewater chloride but low sulfate, which points toward ongoing microbial sulfate reduction (Figure 3) . Populations of ANME did not change or increase in abundance, though ANME-2a-2b were one notable exception, present in downslope gravity cores and also at the more mature seep site 1 (Figure 4D) . We postulate that mud breccia deposits closest to the summit (<80 m) are too young for ANME populations to have developed. If community successional patterns align with those described by Ruff et al. (2018) , these flows were likely extruded less than 2 years ago, and push core communities dominated by aerobic methanotrophs may be even less than a year old. This is in line with findings by Loher et al. (2018a) who documented morphological changes near the western summit of Venere MV between 2014 and 2016 that support its active status. Nevertheless, the high abundances of aerobic methyl-and methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria in recently exposed MV surface sediments are somewhat unexpected. These groups dominate downslope push cores that are lower in methane than others closer to the summit ( Figure 5C ), but they are highly abundant >20 cmbsf into the low-chloride and presumably oxygen-free mud breccia fluids, inhabiting the same depths as obligate anaerobic genera such as Ammonifex. Although Gammaproteobacteria have been shown to dominate bioturbated sediments and maintain endosymbioses with Siboglinid polychaete worms (Thornhill et al., 2008) , no macrofauna were found in Venere MV summit flow deposits. One possible mechanism of delivering oxygen from bottom water into the mud breccia would be via advection through the plated and fractured surface structure of the most recently extruded mud breccia. Testing this hypothesis would require oxygen measurements, which are presently not available. AOM by bacteria is not without precedent: Methylomirabilis, of the NC10 phylum, uses nitrite to generate oxygen and oxidize methane using a particulate methane monooxygenase homologous to those found in aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Ettwig et al., 2010) . Although the typically clay-rich matrix composition of mud breccia would limit diffusion rates, the low biomass in Venere MV summit mud flow deposits may not consume oxygen very quickly. Bottom seawater penetration into recently extruded mud breccia could also explain the delivery of methylotrophic Gammaproteobacteria into shallow mud breccia depths, as these groups normally persist in bottom waters (Tavormina et al., 2010) or at the sediment-water interface, and were not detected in deep sediments from the summit GC. Additional constraints on mud flow dynamics, pore fluid movement, and geochemical interfaces are needed to better understand how microbial communities respond to a highly dynamic environment. The active Venere MV, located on the CAP offshore Italy, emits fluids and mud breccia sourced from kilometer-scale depths within sediments that are depleted in sulfate and chloride with respect to seawater. Microbial communities inhabiting summit mud flow deposits are distinct from those at reference and peripheral methane seepage sites. Downslope mud breccia communities contain several clades of aerobic methyl-and methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria, while ANMEs and SRB develop in older mud breccia deposits further from the summit. Spatiotemporal succession patterns of similar communities from another MV suggest that Venere MV flows may have been extruded less than 2 years ago. Microbial gene content from both of these MVs is distinct from that of other marine subsurface habitats, and likely reflects adaptations to a unique environment.

16888850,"Transcription, Signaling Receptor Activity, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Fatty Acid Metabolism Mediate the Presence of Closely Related Species in Distinct Intertidal and Cold-Seep Habitats","Bathyal cold seeps are isolated extreme deep-sea environments characterized by low species diversity while biomass can be high. The Håkon Mosby mud volcano (Barents Sea, 1,280 m) is a rather stable chemosynthetic driven habitat characterized by prominent surface bacterial mats with high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Here, the nematode Halomonhystera hermesi thrives in high abundances (11,000 individuals 10 cm(-2)). Halomonhystera hermesi is a member of the intertidal Halomonhystera disjuncta species complex that includes five cryptic species (GD1-5). GD1-5's common habitat is characterized by strong environmental fluctuations. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of H. hermesi and GD1, H. hermesi's closest relative. Genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are more strongly expressed in H. hermesi than in GD1, and many genes were only observed in H. hermesi while being completely absent in GD1. Both observations could in part be attributed to high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Additionally, fatty acid elongation was also prominent in H. hermesi confirming the importance of highly unsaturated fatty acids in this species. Significant higher amounts of transcription factors and genes involved in signaling receptor activity were observed in GD1 (many of which were completely absent in H. hermesi), allowing fast signaling and transcriptional reprogramming which can mediate survival in dynamic intertidal environments. GC content was approximately 8% higher in H. hermesi coding unigenes resulting in differential codon usage between both species and a higher proportion of amino acids with GC-rich codons in H. hermesi. In general our results showed that most pathways were active in both environments and that only three genes are under natural selection. This indicates that also plasticity should be taken in consideration in the evolutionary history of Halomonhystera species. Such plasticity, as well as possible preadaptation to low oxygen and high sulfide levels might have played an important role in the establishment of a cold-seep Halomonhystera population.","One of the most important goals in evolutionary biology is to comprehend how and why living organisms diversify (Pfennig et al. 2010) . Dispersal allows organisms to colonize new suitable habitats and found new populations. Speciation in the new habitat has its origin in the establishment of reproductive barriers between source and founder population (Coyne and Orr 2004) . While gene flow between populations is often considered as a homogenizing evolutionary force that can prevent conspecific populations from diverging (Walsh and Mena 2013) , ecological selection can also initiate speciation in the presence of gene flow (Seehausen et al. 2014) . Therefore, restriction of gene flow and ecological differentiation between habitats are two drivers which can mediate speciation, thereby, paving the way for adaptive evolution of newly founded populations (Mayr 1963) . Adaptive evolution is the process in which natural selection will select for advantageous alleles that provide a higher fitness to the organism thereby causing changes in allele frequencies in a population. Adaptive evolution is influenced by mutation rate, recombination, genetic drift, selection, etc. (reviewed in Olson-Manning et al. 2012 ) each of which cause genetic patterns that are traceable in sequence data. In addition, individuals will respond to changes in their environment by remodeling their transcriptome, allowing individuals to quickly respond to environmental conditions. This is referred to as phenotypic plasticity where one genotype can produce multiple phenotypes. While some studies define phenotypic plasticity as nonheritable (Ellner et al. 2011) , gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic modifications which are heritable (Surani et al. 1993; Cubas et al. 1999; Chong and Whitelaw 2004; Bird 2007; Goldberg et al. 2007 ). In the case of cryptic species, that is, morphologically identical but genetically distinct species, the degree of plasticity in morphological traits is limited, despite the fact that they can be found in quite distinct habitats (Vrijenhoek 2009 ). Understanding the biology of cryptic species in different environments requires information on genetic adaptive traits and the degree of plasticity in other traits than morphology (Gittenberger and Gittenberger 2011) . Cryptic diversity is common in marine environments, which may be attributed to the use of chemical cues for mate recognition (Stanhope et al. 1992; Palumbi 1994; Lonsdale et al. 1998) . The existence of cryptic species has been described in different orders of marine nematodes (Derycke et al. 2005 (Derycke et al. , 2007 (Derycke et al. , 2010 , usually the most abundant and diverse Metazoa in marine benthic communities Lambshead and Boucher 2003) . In this work, we focus on the genus Halomonhystera Andrá ssy (2006) belonging to the order of the Monhysterida which is currently situated outside the five clades (I-V) proposed by Blaxter (2011) and placed in clade 5c based on the numerical system of van Megen et al. (2009) . The genus has a widespread geographical distribution and has been identified from deep-sea environments (Van Gaever et al. 2006; Portnova et al. 2010 ) and intertidal regions (Trotter and Webster 1983; Vranken, Herman, et al. 1988; Mokievsky et al. 2005; Derycke et al. 2007 ). Nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data led to the discovery of five cryptic Halomonhystera disjuncta species (GD1-5) with only limited morphometric differences in the Western Scheldt estuary (Derycke et al. 2007; Fonseca et al. 2008) . Halomonhystera was also reported as the dominant nematode genus in the sulfide-rich bacterial mats of the Nyegga pockmark (Nordic Norwegian margin, 730 m) (Portnova et al. 2010 ) and the Hå kon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV, 1,280 m, Barent Sea slope) (Van Gaever et al. 2006 ). However, a recent study revealed subtle morphological and clear genetic differences between the HMMV and intertidal Halomonhystera species (Van Campenhout et al. 2013) : uncorrected p-distances between HMMV and GD1 ranged between 19.1% and 25.2% for the cytochrome oxidase c subunit I gene part, whereas uncorrected p-distances of the nuclear 18S gene ranged between 2.4% and 2.9% and the nuclear ITS-D2D3 concatenated genes showed a divergence of 9.5% (Van Campenhout et al. 2013) . The HMMV Halomonhystera has consequently been described as a new species, Halomonhystera hermesi (Tchesunov et al. 2015) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between H. hermesi and both GD1 and GD4 (Van Campenhout et al. 2013) . For Halomonhystera, a deep-sea invasion from intertidal regions has been hypothesized followed by adaptive evolution as a result of absence of gene flow between both environments (Van Campenhout et al. 2013 ) and strong selective forces in the deep-sea habitat. GD1 is hypothesized to share the most recent ancestor with H. hermesi as it appears to be more resistant to bathyal seep conditions compared with GD2-3 (Van Campenhout et al. 2014 ). In addition, previous studies have revealed a high tolerance of H. disjuncta to low food-and high heavy metal concentrations (Vranken et al. , 1989 Vranken, Tire, et al. 1988) . These studies clearly highlight that in addition to the genetic differences between GD1 and H. hermesi, the intertidal species also have the plasticity to survive deep-sea conditions. Halomonhystera hermesi thrives at the HMMV, a cold, stable chemosynthetically based deep-sea environment (Van Gaever et al. 2006) . The microbial mats, the habitat of H. hermesi, are characterized by limited oxygen penetration (~1 mm) and high sulfide concentrations (up to 4 mM) Van Gaever et al. 2006) . Even though episodic events such as extensive methane venting and mud flows occur, the upflow velocity in the bacterial mats is limited to 0.3-1.0 m yr-1 . In contrast, GD1 thrives on decaying algae in the Western Scheldt, an ephemeral habitat with daily fluctuations in temperature, light, salinity, and frequent inundation due to tidal activity. We, therefore, consider the HMMV habitat to be more stable compared with the intertidal habitat of GD1. The detailed knowledge on the biology and phylogenetic relationships of these two species, together with their occurrence in well characterized and distinct habitats render them an excellent system to study the molecular mechanisms allowing species to thrive in different habitats. To this end, we compared the transcriptome between the intertidal (GD1) and deep-sea nematode (H. hermesi) related species. Evaluation of gene expression will contribute to our understanding of which pathways are important in both species with respect to their environment. Additionally, pinpointing genes that are under natural selection will contribute to our understanding of adaptive evolution of both species. Moreover, its intertidal occurrence subjects GD1 to strong physical, chemical, and biological gradients indicating that it can rapidly adjust to environmental changes. Organisms in fluctuating environments must constantly sense and adapt to environmental changes and must be able to quickly respond to these changes. This may be achieved by transcriptional regulation (Kussell and Leibler 2005) . In contrast, stable environments generally favor specialist species adapted to that specific niche (Miner 2005) . In view of the clear differences in (a)biotic conditions in both habitats, we expected to find substantial differences in the molecular pathways activated in both habitats. More specifically, we expected to find one/more genes expressed and more active pathways in the intertidal than in the deep-sea habitat, and two/an overrepresentation of pathways involved in transcription and environmental information processing in the intertidal GD1 species.  Deep-sea sediment samples were collected, using a TV-guided multicorer, from the active methane seeping Hå kon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV; situated west of the Barents Sea (72.1 N 14.73 E) at an average water depth of 1,280 m) during the Maria S. Merian cruise 2010 (MSM 16/2). Core samples were immediately sliced from 0 to 10 cm (with a 1-cm interval), instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen on board and stored at À80 C. Intertidal monospecific GD1 nematodes reared in the lab were transferred to rehydrated (salinity of 25 practical salinity unit [psu]) defaunated macroalgae (Fucus vesiculosis) and allowed to grow for approximately 4 weeks in three litter bags (mesh size 200 mm) at 8 C and a salinity of 25 psu. Following this period, litter bags were positioned in the Paulina salt marsh (Western Scheldt, The Netherlands, at 51 20.9 0 N, 3 43.5 0 E) allowing nematodes to acclimatize to the environment for 72 h before retrieval. Macroalgae were washed over two stacked sieves (top sieve: 1 mm, bottom sieve: 32 mm) with sieved (32 mm) seawater and fauna was retained on the 32 mm sieve. Meiofauna from the sieve was then collected with sterile artificial seawater (25 psu) and replicate samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at À80 C. The frozen first deep-sea sediment slice (0-1 cm) of three locations (Station MSM16- 0.14 0 N 14 43.94 0 E) and all intertidal samples were washed separately over a 32 mm-mesh sieve. Halomonhystera nematodes were extracted by density gradient centrifugation at 4 C and 3,000 Â g, using Ludox (a colloidal silica polymer; specific gravity 1.18) as a flotation medium . b-mercaptoethanol, in a final concentration of 0.143 M, was added to avoid RNA breakdown. Nematodes were captured on a 32 mm sieve after centrifugation and washed again with a sterile formamideb-mercaptoethanol (0.143 M) solution and finally retained in the same solution. Replicate samples of both deep-sea and intertidal samples contained approximately 1,500-2,000 nematodes. To minimize the effect of different life stages, only adult H. hermesi and GD1 nematodes of each replicate were morphologically identified and randomly and manually picked out using a binocular microscope in a 4 C climate room. Samples from GD1 or H. hermesi were pooled, prior to RNA extraction, into 50 ml RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini kit, Qiagen Inc., Dü sseldorf, Germany) to which we added b-mercaptoethanol in a final concentration of 0.143 M. Each sample (deep sea and intertidal) contained approximately 5,000 nematodes and such pooling of replicates was a necessary practical consideration to obtain sufficient RNA. The cuticle and cell membranes of nematodes and cells were disrupted by vortexing with beads (1 min at 5,000 rpm). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Dü sseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was removed by on-column digest with DNase I. RNA was quantified by measuring the optical density (OD) at 260 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (2000 UV-Vis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). RNA purity was assessed at an absorbance ratio of OD 260/280 and OD 260/230 . RNA integrity was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. cDNA Library Construction, Illumina Sequencing, and Quality Filtering Samples were sent to Bio S&T Inc. (Canada) to perform cDNA synthesis and normalization allowing us to sequence low expressed genes. Briefly, the cDNA library was constructed with about 8 mg of total RNA using a modified Clonetech SMART cDNA Library Construction kit using oligo(dT) primers. Double stranded cDNAs were obtained by primer extension and purified. To increase the ability to sequence low expressed transcripts, cDNAs were normalized, reamplified, and purified (Bio S&T, Canada). Further library construction and sequencing were performed by Genomics Core, UZ Leuven, Belgium. Briefly, the cDNA was sheared using the Covaris M220 machine with a maximum fragment length of 800 bp and a fragment size peak around 450-500 bp. cDNA libraries were end repaired, and NEXTflex adaptors from BIOO Scientific were ligated using the SPRIworks robot (Beckman) followed by an AMPure bead purification to remove adaptor dimers. Libraries were amplified using a 12 cycle polymerase chain reaction step with NEXTflex primer mix. An additional AMPure bead purification was performed. The resulting cDNA libraries were pooled and paired-end sequenced on a single Illumina MiSeq 2*250 bp lane. Because of a low read diversity within deepsea reads (troubling for the nucleotide incorporation imaging software), this cDNA library was mixed in with other samples and sequenced on the same Illumina MiSeq 2*250 bp machine. Data from both runs were pooled. Low quality read ends (<Q20) were trimmed with FastX 0.0.13 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit, last accessed November 1, 2015). MiSeq adapters were trimmed only at the end (at least 10 bp overlap and 90% match) with cutadapt 1.0 (Martin 2011) . Using FastX 0.0.13 and ShortRead 1.14.4 (Morgan et al. 2009 ), short reads (length <50 bp), poly A-reads (more than 90% of the bases equal A), ambiguous reads (containing N), low quality reads (more than 50% of the bases <Q25), and artifact reads (all but three bases in the read equal one base type) were removed in succession. Using bowtie 2.0.0-beta5 (Langmead et al. 2009 ), reads that align to PhiX (an adapter-ligated library used as a control for Illumina sequencing runs) or human hg19 were identified and removed. Because of quality drop for all reverse reads after 150 bp, these reads were all cut after 150 bp. Finally, cDNA primers were removed using the CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0.3 trim sequences tool. The raw sequencing reads were deposited at the Short Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under bioproject SRP050898 containing biosamples SRS748702 (Run SRR1657929) and SRS748703 (Run SRR1657930). De novo assembly was conducted using the CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0.3 de novo assembly tool according to the manufacturer's preset features. Contigs shorter than 200 bp were removed. To remove redundant transcripts and retain a set of contigs each representing a putatively unique isoform (unigenes), the open-source program CD-HIT-EST (Li and Godzik 2006 ) was used to cluster contigs at a 95% sequence identity. The largest contig of each cluster was retained in the data set. The coding sequences (CDS) were predicted using the open reading frame (ORF)-predictor server (Min et al. 2005 ) with a 200 bp CDS cutoff. BLAST + (Camacho et al. 2009 ) was used to subject the remaining unigenes to a similarity search against NCBI's nonredundant (nr) database (standard genetic code) using the BLASTx algorithm (Altschul et al. 1990) , with a cutoff e-value of 10 À3 and a maximum of 20 BLAST hits. The top BLASTx hit was used to assign taxonomy to each unigene using a custom perl script (Get_classification.pl, Supplementary Material online). Unigenes classified as Nematoda were selected for further analysis. Prediction of pathways expressed in both data sets was done by using known metabolic and signaling pathways previously found in Eukaryotes and nematodes using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) automated Annotation Server (KAAS) (Moriya et al. 2007 ). Unigenes were submitted to KAAS with the preset Eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis briggsae, Brugia malayi, Loa loa, and Trichinella spiralis were added as additional sequence templates; the option ""basis of single-best hit"" was selected. KAAS annotates transcripts with KEGG orthology (KO) identifiers representing an orthologous group of genes linked to an object in the KEGG pathways and BRITE hierarchy (Mao et al. 2005; Moriya et al. 2007 ). Unigenes from both transcriptomes with the same KO identifier, that is, functional annotation, were considered to be shared between both species. The KO identifiers were mapped against KEGG pathways to reconstruct pathways (http://www.genome.jp/ kegg/mapper.html, last accessed April 30, 2015). KEGG pathways involved in human diseases were not taken into further consideration. KO identifiers were additionally mapped against BRITE hierarchical classifications of protein families. To extract pathways that are over-and underrepresented in the deep-sea and intertidal habitats, respectively, KEGG pathways and protein families of unique unigenes from each transcriptome were determined separately using the Cytoscape (Shannon et al. 2003) plugin BINGO (Maere et al. 2005) with both transcriptomes combined as a reference set. P values were false-discovery rate (FDR)-corrected. To retrieve Gene Ontology (GO) terms describing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components (Ashburner et al. 2000) , the publicly available BLAST2GO-platform (Conesa et al. 2005 ) was used. Annotations were conducted for unigenes with default parameters (e-value ! 10 À6 , Annotation cutoff !55, and a GO weight of 5). BLAST2GO was also used to retrieve InterPro (conserved patterns in sequences) annotations and merged with GO terms for a wide functional range cover in annotation. Because some unigenes without KO annotation displayed a GO annotation, the following step was taken to increase the amount of previously defined shared unigenes (based on KO identifier). Unigenes without KO identifier but with a GO annotation and a CDS of at least 200 bp from one transcriptome were aligned against both the shared unigenes and unigenes without KEGG annotation of the other transcriptome using the PROmer pipeline of the MUMmer 3.0 software (Kurtz et al. 2004 ) with default parameters. Unigenes with an inframe PROmer hit, minimum similarity of 75% and an alignment length of minimum 300 bp were additionally considered as shared. Determining overrepresented GO-terms in unique unigenes was performed as described before. Similarly, we used BINGO to determine whether each complete GO data set was enriched in level 2 GO terms compared with both data sets combined. Van Campenhout et al. Positive Selection, Amino Acid Composition, and Codon Usage Orthologs present in both transcriptomes were determined by selecting unigenes with a CDS of minimal 200 bp which were then aligned and compared using the PROmer pipeline with default parameters. We only retained in-frame PROmer hits (similarity ! 75% and an alignment length of 300 bp) that matched the same KO identifier. The full length CDS of filtered ortologous gene pairs were then aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994) , with default parameters, provided in the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 6.0 (MEGA6) software package (Tamura et al. 2013 ) and uncorrected p-distances were calculated. Positive selection was tested using the ratios of the rates of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous sites (Ka) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) using KaKs_Calculator 2.0 (Wang et al. 2010 ) with the g-MYN model. This model incorporates previously unaddressed dynamic features of evolving DNA sequences in transition/transversion rate, nucleotide frequency, and unequal transitional substitution. The model further accounts for DNA sequences unequal substitution rates among different sites (Wang et al. 2009 ). The alignment of orthologous gene pairs was also used to analyze GC content, amino acid (AA) composition, and codon usage. Amino acid frequencies were determined by summing the occurrence of each AA per translated CDS (tCDS) and dividing it through the total amount of AA present for each tCDS. Codon frequencies per AA were obtained by summing the occurrence of each single codon per tCDS and dividing it through the respective AA count of the tCDS. GC content, AA composition, and codon frequencies per gene were determined using a custom perl script (AA_counter.pl and Codon_counter.pl, Supplementary Material online) and averaged over all unigenes. To investigate whether significant differences were present between deep-sea and intertidal transcriptomes, mean values of both H. hermesi and GD1 corresponding orthologous unigenes were subtracted. The H. hermesi and GD1 data sets were then pooled and randomly permuted into two equal groups after which GC content, AAand codon frequencies were calculated and subtracted from each other. This was repeated 100,000 times with custom R-scripts (GC_permutation.R, AA_permutation.R and Codon_permutation.R, Supplementary Material online) in R version 3.0.2 (R Core Team 2013) and the obtained values were seen as a null distribution for the GC content, codon, and AA frequencies. The P value is then calculated as the fraction of how many times the permuted difference is equal or more extreme than the observed difference and was FDR-corrected. If the observed difference fell outside the range of the null distribution, no P values could be calculated and P values were considered to be <E À6 . Deep-sea and intertidal contigs with a nematode top-BLAST hit were selected and used to generate a single new assembly using the de novo assembly tool in CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0.3. The assembly was treated in the same manner as described above (CD-HIT-EST clustering, BLASTx and functional annotation). Cleaned deep-sea and intertidal reads were mapped against the full assembly using the RNA-seq tool in CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0.3. (minimum length fraction = 0.9 and minimum similarity fraction = 0.8). Values for relative expression were based on mean RPKM (Reads Per Kilo-base of exon model per Million mapped reads) values. A statistical analysis on proportions (Kal's test) was performed and P values were FDR-corrected. The RNA-seq analysis resulted in five data sets: 1) uniquely expressed genes in H. hermesi, 2) uniquely expressed genes in GD1, 3) shared unigenes similarly expressed in both species, 4) differentially overexpressed unigenes in H. hermesi, and 5) differentially overexpressed unigenes in GD1. Data set 1 and 2 were not analyzed further as this was already performed for the complete transcriptome. To increase the validity of the three other RNA-seq data sets, only unigenes with a KO identifier which was present in both original nematode transcriptomes and present in only one RNA-seq data set were retained. Over-and underrepresented KEGG pathways, protein families, and GO annotations of differentially expressed genes were determined as described above.  Illumina MiSeq 2*250 bp cDNA sequencing generated a total of 3.47 and 2.47 Gb for the deep-sea and intertidal samples respectively (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). After quality assessment and data filtering, 4,605,081 and 3,105,224 pair-end reads remained for deep-sea and intertidal samples, respectively, (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). De novo assembly yielded a lower amount of deep-sea contigs (57,636) than intertidal contigs (72,678). In terms of unigenes, 54,767 deep-sea and 68,537 intertidal unigenes with a respective N50 of 933 and 720 bp were found. The size of the deep-sea unigenes ranged from 200 to 149,303 bp with a mean length of 750 whereas the intertidal unigenes ranged from 200 to 8,783 bp with a mean length of 618 bp (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). It must be noted that the large unigenes within the deepsea assembly are most likely partially assembled prokaryotic chromosomes. ORF prediction (>200 bp CDS in length) was very similar for deep-sea (81.45%) and intertidal (83.47%) unigenes. BLASTx results showed that 33,079 (60.40%) deep-sea and 42,409 (61.89%) intertidal unigenes had at least one BLAST result with an e-value 10 . Surprisingly, a substantial portion of the unigenes did not give a nematode top-blast hit. Instead, most deep-sea unigenes classified as Bacteria (61.01%) whereas intertidal unigenes were mostly classified as Eukaryotes (92.52%) ( fig. 1A) . Of the intertidal unigenes that were classified as Eukaryota, only 49.51% could be assigned to the Metazoa (fig. 1B) . The remaining part (40.31%) mainly belonged to Viridiplantae. In contrast, the deep-sea eukaryote unigenes were nearly all assigned to the Metazoa (93%; fig. 1B ). Within the Metazoa, the composition of both data sets was highly similar: 67.99% deep-sea and 68.15% intertidal unigenes could be assigned to the Ecdysozoa, 16.02% deep-sea and 18.19% intertidal unigenes were assigned to the Chordata, and 8.95% deep-sea and 7.80% intertidal unigenes were designated as Lophotrochozoa ( fig. 1C ). The majority of the Ecdysozoa unigenes were classified as nematodes: 5,498 (79.95%) unigenes for the deep-sea and 8,588 (64.96%) for the intertidal data set ( fig. 1D) . Overall, 16.62% and 20.28% of the deep-sea and intertidal unigenes, respectively, were assigned to nematodes. Based on their nematode top-BLAST hit 5,498 deep-sea (H. hermesi) and 8,588 intertidal (GD1) unigenes were retained for further analysis. Halomonhysterahermesi unigenes had a maximum length of 7,235 bp and an average length of 943.07 bp. This was comparable to GD1 unigenes which had a maximum length of 8,783 bp and an average length of 837.39 bp (table 1). The amount of unigenes with a CDS longer than 200 bp was lower for H. hermesi (5,227) than for GD1 (8,102). GC content of the H. hermesi unigenes was higher than that of the GD1 unigenes (56.11% vs. 48.71%, respectively). Using the KAAS, 2,985 H. hermesi unigenes (54.29%) were assigned to 1,648 KO identifiers, whereas 4,548 GD1 unigenes (52.96%) were assigned to 2,166 KO identifiers. Both transcriptomes shared 1,246 KO identifiers corresponding to 2,499 H. hermesi-and 3,244 GD1 unigenes. In addition, 402 KO identifiers were uniquely found in H. hermesi (corresponding to 487 unigenes), and 920 KO identifiers were uniquely found in GD1 (corresponding to 1,304 unigenes). These genes are further addressed as uniquely expressed unigenes. The KO identifiers were mapped to 245 shared pathways, and to three and ten unique pathways for H. hermesi and GD1, respectively (full data set in supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). However, only 1-3 unigenes were mapped to these unique pathways. The same three pathways were most represented in deep-sea and intertidal nematodes: ""protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum,"" ""endocytosis,"" and ""spliceosome"" (table 2) . Of all shared pathways, 40 had a higher amount of unigenes mapped for H. hermesi than for GD1 (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). ""Oxidative phosphorylation"" was the pathway with the highest differences in mapped proteins, that is, eight additional H. hermesi unigenes were mapped against this pathway compared with GD1. A higher amount of GD1 unigenes were mapped to 156 pathways compared with H. hermesi. Unigenes that were uniquely found in H. hermesi or GD1 were considered to be characteristic of the deep-sea and intertidal environment, respectively, and were used to investigate pathways that were over/underrepresented in a particular habitat. Six KEGG pathways: ""oxidative phosphorylation,"" ""ubiquinone"" and ""other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis,"" ""benzoate degradation,"" ""terpenoid backbone biosynthesis,"" ""biosynthesis of ansamycins"" and ""fatty acid elongation"" were significantly overrepresented in H. hermesi unique unigenes (P values < 0.05), all belonging to the metabolism category ( fig. 2A) . The unique unigenes were most enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation (P = 2.92E ) belonging to the overrepresented energy metabolism class (P = 4.01E ; fig. 2A ). A closer inspection of our data revealed that the observed overrepresentation was due to NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha/beta subcomplex subunits, several F-andV-type ATPase subunits, and succinate dehydrogenase, involved in the electron transport chain at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Three KEGG pathways were significantly underrepresented: ""tight junction,"" ""circadian entrainment,"" and ""salivary secretion."" For GD1, overand underrepresented pathways in which unique unigenes were involved belonged to a wider spectrum of molecular pathways compared with the deep-sea transcriptome ( fig.  2B ). The most significant overrepresented pathway in GD1 uniquely annotated unigenes belonged to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway (p = 2.24E ; fig. 2B ) and was mostly the result of G-protein coupled receptors in the GD1 transcriptome which were not expressed in H. hermesi. Six other overrepresented pathways were ""tropane,"" ""piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis,"" ""signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, ribosome,"" ""sulfur relay system,"" ""ubiquitin mediated proteolysis,"" and ""mismatch repair."" Many more pathways were underrepresented in GD1 compared with underrepresented H. hermesi pathways (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). The top 3 were ""fatty acid metabolism"" (P = 1.07E À4 ), ""tight junctions"" (P = 3.54E À4 ), and ""fatty acid biosynthesis"" (P = 7.01E ). Only protein families involved in genetic information processing were significantly (P = 4.42E ) overrepresented in H. hermesi unique genes as a result of overrepresented unique unigenes involved in ""transcription factors,"" ""proteasome,"" ""t-RNA biogenesis,"" and ""ribosome biogenesis"" (fig. 3A) , whereas exosome involved proteins were underrepresented. The two most overrepresented protein families in GD1 unique unigenes were G-protein-coupled receptors (P = 5.26E ) and transcription factors (P = 3.32E ; fig. 3B ). Except for the overrepresentation of prenyltransferases, all other overrepresented protein families are involved in genetic information processing (P = 3.43E ). GO terms were assigned to 3,657 (72.94%) H. hermesi and 5,636 (72.05%) GD1 unigenes which could be classified into three categories: cellular component, molecular function, and biological process (fig. 4) . The BINGO analysis of each GO data sets separate compared with both data sets combined did not reveal any overrepresented level 2 GO-terms. As such, GO annotation were highly similar between intertidal and deepsea samples and reflected very well annotation patterns observed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (depicted from geneontology.org). GO-annotation yielded 6,108 H. hermesi-and 9,591 GD1 GO cellular component annotations, 5,086 H. hermesi and 7,417 GD1 molecular function annotations, and 15,981 H. hermesi and 23,692 GD1 GO annotations for biological process. Within the cellular component category 32.95% and 32.69% of GD1 and H. hermesi unigenes were assigned to ""Cell,"" followed by ""Organelle"" (22.48% and 21.45%), ""Membrane"" (19.78% and 20.95%) and ""Macromolecular Complex"" (13.43% and 12.45%) (fig. 4 ). GO term assignment of H. hermesi-and GD1 unigenes, respectively, within the molecular function category, was dominated by ""Binding"" (40.59% and 40.61%) and ""Catalytic activity"" (35.40% and 33.39%) (fig. 4) . ""Receptor activity"" and ""nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity"" were significantly overrepresented in GD1 unique unigenes (P values = 3.18E À5 and 1.80E À6 , respectively). Finally, within the biological process category 12 GO-terms captured more than 90% of the assignments of which ""Single-Organism Process,"" ""Cellular Process,"" and ""Metabolic Process"" were the three largest classes for both transcriptomes (fig. 4) . The addition of selected PROmer hits resulted into 2,492 H. hermesi-and 4,752 GD1 unique unigenes. Halomonhysterahermesi unique unigenes only showed overrepresented GO terms from the molecular function category (P values in table 3) related to ""enzyme inhibitor-and peptidase regulator activity"" (supplementary fig. S1 , Supplementary Material online). Much more overrepresented GO terms in GD1 unique unigenes were found (supplementary table S5 values in  table 3 ). Moreover, overrepresented GO terms dealing with signaling pathways, for example, receptor-and kinase activity were prominent in both the molecular function and biological process category for GD1. Positive Selection, Amino Acid Composition, and Codon Usage Filtering PROmer hits based on similarity (!75%) and alignment length (!300 bp) resulted into 1,053 hits with the same functional annotation in both data sets. GC content of H. hermesi unigenes (58.97%) was significantly Van Campenhout et al. À6 ) compared with corresponding GD1 sequences (50.96%). Genetic divergence (uncorrected p-distances) between orthologous pairs ranged from 8.3% to 40.1%. Mean values of Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks ratio ( fig. 5A) were 0.125, 3.266 and 0.0453, respectively. Of the orthologous pairs only three had a Ka/Ks ! 1 which were mapped to three different KEGG pathways: ""proteasome (20S proteasome subunit beta 3),"" ""Spliceosome (splicing factor U2AF 65 kDa subunit),"" and ""tight junctions (Myosin heavy chain)."" In both transcriptomes, GC rich codons were more frequently used, but this was especially true for the deep-sea transcriptome ( fig. 5B ). All codon differences were significant (supplementary table S6, Supplementary Material online). The relative frequency of amino acids (AAs) with GC-rich codons (Alanine, and Arginine) was significantly higher (both P values = 0.00105) in H. hermesi ( fig. 5B ). In contrast, GD1 had significantly higher relative frequency of AAs with AU-rich codons ( fig. 5C ) such as Isoleucine (P = 0.00105), Lysine (P = 0.00672), and Asparagine (P < E -6). In addition, GD1 had higher frequencies of Threonine (P = 0.01467), while relative frequencies of Valine (P = 0.00544), Histidine (P = 0.0117), and Leucine (P = 0.0129) were higher in H. hermesi. Summary statistics of the null distribution and P values can be found in supplementary table S7, Supplementary Material online. The de novo assembly, based on H. hermesi-and GD1 unigenes collectively, resulted in 3,345 unigenes with a CDS larger 200 bp. We identified 740 and 1,693 unigenes exclusive to H. hermesi and GD1, respectively, and 1,014 unigenes expressed in both species of which 845 were significantly differentially expressed (Kal's Z-test). After applying the KO filtering on the 1,014 unigenes, we retained 142 and 118 unigenes that were differentially overexpressed in H. hermesi and GD1, respectively, whereas 90 were equally expressed. We further focus on those genes that are involved in KEGG pathways and protein families that were shown to be over/ underrepresented, allowing us to now compare gene expression levels of shared genes in these categories. Seven shared unigenes that are involved in transcription had a significantly higher gene expression for GD1 compared with four H. hermesi overexpressed unigenes. Out of nine shared unigenes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, six revealed to have higher gene expression levels for H. hermesi ( fig. 6 ). We observed very high gene expression differences for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) between both species. Moreover, two subunits of the electron transport chain complex III, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase cytochrome c1 subunit (CYC1), and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core subunit 2 (QCR2) had significantly higher gene expression values in H. hermesi. Halomonhystera hermesi and GD1 have a very similar morphology but were considered different species based on their genetic differentiation at mitochondrial and nuclear loci (Van Campenhout et al. 2013 ). The phylogenetic position of H. hermesi amidst the intertidal species suggests that H. hermesi has originated from shallow water relatives followed by adaptive evolution in the deep sea. However, no typical coldseep adaptations such as ecto-and/or endosymbionts or sulfur crystal were observed (Van Gaever et al. 2006 , which suggests that adaptations are situated at the molecular level. Our results revealed that both species use the same molecular pathways to cope and survive in their distinct environment. Nevertheless, we found a higher amount of unigenes and active pathways in GD1, and most shared unigenes were differentially expressed between both species. Gene expression can be influenced by environmental factors (Lobo 2008 ) and our results revealed that different pathways were overrepresented in each environment suggesting that these pathways are of high importance to survive in the respective environment. The experimental procedure to collect specimens from either habitat may have added additional differences in gene expression between both habitats, and we may also have missed some very low expressed genes due to the normalization step. In addition, sex ratio differences between both populations might have influenced our results. Nevertheless, we believe that our approach is the most solid and feasible way for comparing the transcriptomes of both species in such different habitats. Our data disclosed a higher amount of unigenes, more overrepresented GO terms and a wider spectrum of molecular overrepresented pathways in GD1. Transcription factors were clearly more overrepresented in GD1: 71 transcription factors, based on BRITE protein families, and 20 basal transcription factors, based on KEGG pathways, were found in GD1 whereas 43 transcription factors (protein families) and 11 basal transcription factors were detected in H. hermesi. Moreover, of the shared genes most unigenes involved in transcription had higher gene expression values for GD1 compared with H. hermesi. This suggests that the activation and expression of transcription factors is much more prominent in species that inhabit fluctuating environments. Intertidal mudflats, the preferred habitat for GD1, are highly dynamic systems that are characterized by rapid changes in environmental variables (de Brouwer et al. 2006) . Organisms in fluctuating environments must constantly adapt their behavior to survive (Kussell and Leibler 2005) and can perform faster transcriptional reprogramming (New et al. 2014) . The ability to rapidly respond to changing environmental features further relies on sensing these changes (Lopez-Maury et al. 2008) . Other prominent overrepresented GO terms in GD1 nematodes were the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Moreover, more than three times more GPCRs were identified in GD1 compared with H. hermesi. The high amount of GPCRs further resulted in an enrichment of the neuroactive ligandreceptor interaction class (environmental information processing). GPCRs consist of chemosensory receptors which mediate most cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters and are able to detect extracellular chemical stimuli converting them to intracellular responses (Mombaerts 1999) . The enrichment in GPCRs is a clear indication of a heightened sensorial and neural activity of GD1 compared with H. hermesi. This, and the higher amount of transcription factors and higher gene expression values of shared genes in GD1 illustrate the importance of species to swiftly detect and respond environmental changes to be able to live in variable environments. Oxidative phosphorylation is the mitochondrial process in which the energy released by the transfer of electrons over electron transport carriers is used to establish a proton gradient which in turn is employed to produce energy under the form of ATP (Voet et al. 2006) . Our results show that this process is more strongly expressed in H. hermesi and 43 H. hermesi unigenes were mapped against the oxidative phosphorylation compared with 35 mapped GD1 unigenes. Interestingly, we have identified a number of overexpressed genes, part of complex III (electron transport chain) in H. hermesi. The HMMV, the habitat of H. hermesi, is a chemosynthetic environment characterized by high hydrogen sulfide concentrations (Van Gaever et al. 2006) . Hydrogen sulfide is a toxin that is capable of impairing biological processes in Metazoa. The toxicity of sulfide is mainly a result of inhibition of aerobic respiration by inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (NRC 1979) and thus interfering with cellular respiration (Somero et al. 1989; Vismann 1991) . Interestingly, the most overexpressed gene in H. hermesi involved in oxidative phosphorylation was cytochrome c oxidase c subunit I which might be a countermeasure to overcome sulfide poisoning. Sulfide can also be oxidized in the mitochondria and electrons can be incorporated into the electron transport chain by ubiquinone or ubiquinol-cytochrome-c oxidoreductase (complex III) (Powell and Somero 1986; Russell et al. 1989; Vö lkel and Grieshaber 1996) . A higher expression of specific complex III genes might, therefore, be an important adaptation to sulfidic environments. However, oxidative phosphorylation is also influenced by a variety of other abiotic factors such as temperature (Toffaletti et al. 2003) , pressure (Theron et al. 2000) , salinity (Li et al. 2014) , and oxygen levels (Mustroph et al. 2010) . Oxygen levels rapidly deplete beneath 1 mm sediment depth at the HMMV ) while H. hermesi was FIG. 6.-Expressed unigenes involved in oxidative phosphorylation for H. hermesi and GD1. Significant differences (P < 0.05) are indicated with an asterisk. SDHB, succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur subunit; CYC1, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase cytochrome c1 subunit; QCR2, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core subunit 2; ATPeV1C, V-type H+-transporting ATPase subunit C ; COX1, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1; NDUFA10, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10 ; ATPeF1A, F-type H+-transporting ATPase subunit alpha; ATPeV1H, V-type H+-transporting ATPase subunit H; NDUFV1, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 1; NDUFB10, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex subunit 10. identified up to 10 cm sediment depth. The effect of low oxygen levels include the induction of fermentation and glycolysis (Mustroph et al. 2010) , influence mitochondria fusion (Tondera et al. 2009 ), mitochondrial biogenesis (Qin et al. 2014) , and mitochondrial organelle number and volume (Gupta 2002) , which implies that mitochondria are key players in the adaptation to low oxygen concentrations. Furthermore, the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which is rapidly induced by low oxygen levels (Laderoute et al. 2006) was underrepresented in GD1 suggesting that oxygen levels are important. In summary, our results indicate that sulfideand oxygen concentrations are presumably the most important environmental features explaining overrepresentation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in H. hermesi unigenes. The deep-sea species further showed a clear response in fatty acid elongation compared with GD1. We observed an overrepresentation of the fatty acid elongation pathway whereas the fatty acid metabolism was underrepresented in GD1 both in KEGG and GO annotations. A recent study revealed that H. hermesi has higher proportions of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs, chain length ! 20 carbons and ! 3 double bond) due to increased proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-20:5o3) and the presence of docosahexanoic acid (DHA-22:6o3) which was absent in GD1 (Van Campenhout J and Vanreusel A submitted for publication). These HUFAs are believed to be essential in maintaining membrane fluidity under pressure (Yano et al. 1997 ) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-C22:6o3) was hypothesized to be the key to homeoviscous adaptations to depth and temperature changes in vertically migrating planktonic copepods (Pond et al. 2014) . Given the absence of these HUFAs in the food source of H. hermesi (Van Gaever et al. 2009 ), the nematode has most likely the ability to synthesize these HUFAs. EPA, and DHA can be assimilated into triglyceride forms and stored until they are required for incorporation in the membrane, betaoxidation, signalizing activity, etc. (Williams and Burdge 2006; Reisner 2012) . Our results at the molecular level now confirm that these HUFAs are indeed important to deep-sea adaptation. GC Content, Amino Acid Composition, and Codon Usage Differs between Deep-Sea and Intertidal Species Our results revealed that the genetic divergence (uncorrected p-distances) between orthologous pairs ranged from 8.3% to 40.1%. This observation further confirms the identity of both species and is influenced by the significant higher GC content in H. hermesi than in GD1 orthologous pairs. To date, many hypothesis such as directional mutation pressure (Sueoka 1988) , metabolism (Martin 1995) , CDS length (Oliver and Marin 1996) , nitrogen fixation, genome size (Musto et al. 2006) , DNA polymerase III subunit alpha (Zhao et al. 2007) , and environmental pressure (Foerstner et al. 2005) have been postulated to explain varying GC contents. The GC content of both Halomonhystera species is correlated with codon usage bias, especially at the third codon position and with amino acid content, a pattern that has been frequently observed (Bernardi 1985; Wilquet and Van de Casteele 1999; Basak et al. 2004; Foerstner et al. 2005) . Furthermore, nucleotide bias can have a dramatic effect on the amino acid composition of encoded proteins (Lobry 1997; Singer and Hickey 2000) and it is currently believed that amino acid composition is more correlated to GC-content of the genome than to environment (Moura et al. 2013 ). In addition, arginine and alanine have been postulated as the ""most piezophilic amino acids,"" playing a role in adaptation to the piezophilic lifestyle in organisms (Di Giulio 2005; Jun et al. 2011; Pradel et al. 2013) . One possible reason is the cost of ATP synthesis imposed on H. hermesi by low oxygen levels, low temperatures, and high sulfide concentrations. Whatever the driving force behind the GC content differences might be, it is clear that the different environments indirectly result in different codon usage with relatively small differences in amino acid abundances. Adaptation depends on the natural selection of individuals with higher fitness thereby increasing their chance to produce more viable offspring (Darwin 1859 ). We could detect three genes that are subjected to positive selection. The 20S proteasome subunit beta 3 is part of the large 20S proteasome (28 subunits) the barrel shaped cylindrical core of the 26S proteasome, which degrades ubiquitinated proteins in an ATPdependent process (Voet et al. 2006) . This subunit has no catalytic activity (Jung et al. 2009 ) and its exact role in deepsea adaptation remains unknown. The Splicing factor U2AF 65 kDA subunit is part of the U2 auxiliary factor important in mRNA splicing by recognizing the polypyrimidine tract at the 3 0 -end of introns (Wahl et al. 2009 ). U2AF65 preferentially binds on uridine-rich sites with frequent interruptions by cytidine residues but variation in the tract sequences and length affects the efficiency of splice site recognition (Singh et al. 1995) . Halomonhysterahermesi has a higher GC content which might constrain the presence of uridine rich tracts in mRNA impairing the U2AF65 binding efficiency. Positive selection on U2AF65 might, therefore, be an indirect result of environmental factors acting on GC content and can be essential to better recognize splice sites. In addition, mechanisms such as alternative splicing are known to be a response to external stimuli and play an important role in gene function diversification and regulation (Stamm 2002; Ramani et al. 2011 ) but knowledge on its true role in adaptation remains scant. The ""myosin heavy chain"" is involved in tight junctions and its amino acid composition can adaptively alter its pressure sensitivity (Morita 2008 (Morita , 2010 . Tight junctions, underrepresented in GD1, establish physiological barriers that regulate the movement of ions, small solutes, and fluid between tissue compartments (Gonzalez-Mariscal et al. 2003) . Both osmotic pressure and hydrostatic pressure are known to affect tight junctions (Tokuda et al. 2009; Gunzel and Yu 2013) , suggesting that pressure and salinity may be important drivers for the adaptive changes in both species. In contrast to the low number of genes detected to be under positive selection, we observed a high rate of synonymous substitutions for those genes that were identified in both species. This highlights that new mutations which give rise to amino acid changes are removed from the populations by purifying selection, and that these genes are under high functional constraint. However, the molecular basis of adaptation is not only restricted to CDS but also includes noncoding regulatory sequences, for example, promoters (Lopez-Maury et al. 2008) and enhancers (Kamachi et al. 2009 ). Functionally important nontranslated sequences have been hypothesized to also be subject to positive and purifying selection (Andolfatto 2005). We currently lack information on these regulatory sequences and further research is required. The low amount of genes under selection can be the result of several possibilities. First, increase in synonymous substitution rates may obscure detection of genes under positive selection (Erixon and Oxelman 2008) . Second, it has been suggested that also synonymous sites are subject of nonneutral evolution (Chamary et al. 2006 ), but our analysis did not accounted for this. Third, we lack any information on adaptive evolution of uniquely expressed genes which might be under selection. Fourth, under the hypothesis that H. hermesi has an intertidal ancestor, this ancestor might have been preadapted to certain deep-sea conditions. Intertidal sediments, as well as decaying macroalgae, show similar environmental characteristics as a cold-seep environment such as hypoxic/anoxic conditions and high sulfide concentration as well as low temperatures in the winter and temporary high salinity levels are not out of the ordinary. As such, several genes might have been preadapted allowing synonymous mutations to accumulate. Finally, many genes were uniquely expressed in both species. However, caution is required for the correct interpretation of our results as we here compared two species (without genomic data available) from two different environments and sampled only a single point in time. As such, it remains to be investigated whether the uniquely expressed genes are the result of adaptive evolution of, for example, regulatory sequences, or are in fact the result of environmental signals acting at the level of gene expression regulation at the time of sampling. Our results, combined with the tolerance of GD1 for bathyal cold-seep conditions (Van Campenhout et al. 2014) , do suggest that plasticity should be taken into account. It remains to be determined to what extent plasticity or preadaptation of intertidal nematodes played a role in adaptive evolution of cold-seep nematodes. In our study, the transcriptomes of two phylogenetically closely related marine nematode species from contrasting environments (deep sea and intertidal) have been compared. We revealed that most pathways are shared between both habitats, but several pathways and genes were differentially expressed in different habitats. Oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism/elongation appeared to be of higher importance in the deep sea. In addition, we observed a higher GC content in H. hermesi resulting in higher amino acid frequencies with GC-rich codons affecting codon usage between H. hermesi and GD1 orthologous. Meanwhile the dynamic feature of GD1's habitat was reflected in higher amounts of transcription factors, more strongly expressed signaling receptor activity, and a higher amount of active pathways and genes. Many genes were uniquely expressed in one species and only few genes show a signal that natural selection has been involved in their evolution. This indicates that Halomonhystera species might be preadapted to specific environmental conditions such as low oxygen levels and high sulfide concentrations.

20677516,Near-specular acoustic scattering from a buried submarine mud volcano.,"Submarine mud volcanoes are objects that form on the seafloor due to the emission of gas and fluidized sediment from the Earth’s interior. They vary widely in size, can be exposed or buried, and are of interest to the underwater acoustics community as potential sources of active sonar clutter. Coincident seismic reflection data and low frequency bistatic scattering data were gathered from one such buried mud volcano located in the Straits of Sicily. The bistatic data were generated using a pulsed piston source and a 64-element horizontal array, both towed over the top of the volcano. The purpose of this work was to appropriately model low frequency scattering from the volcano using the bistatic returns, seismic bathymetry, and knowledge of the general geoacoustic properties of the area’s seabed to guide understanding and model development. Ray theory, with some approximations, was used to model acoustic propagation through overlying layers. Due to the volcano’s size, scattering was modeled using geometric...",N/A,Anthony Gerig,2007,18247739,10.1121/1.2793703
14369402,The Microbiome and Occurrence of Methanotrophy in Carnivorous Sponges,"As shown by recent studies, filter-feeding sponges are known to host a wide variety of microorganisms. However, the microbial community of the non-filtering carnivorous sponges (Porifera, Cladorhizidae) has been the subject of less scrutiny. Here, we present the results from a comparative study of the methanotrophic carnivorous sponge Cladorhiza methanophila from a mud volcano-rich area at the Barbados Accretionary Prism (BAP), and five carnivorous species from the Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge. Results from 16S rRNA microbiome data indicate the presence of a diverse assemblage of associated microorganisms in carnivorous sponges mainly from the Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriaceae and Thaumarchaeota. While the abundance of particular groups varied throughout the dataset, we found interesting similarities to previous microbiome results from non-carnivorous deep sea sponges, suggesting that the carnivorous sponges share characteristics of a previously hypothesized putative deep-sea sponge microbial community. Chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis was confirmed for C. methanophila through a microbial community with a high abundance of Methylococcales and very light isotopic δ13C and δ15N ratios (-60 to -66‰/3.5 to 5.2‰) compared to the other cladorhizid species (-22 to -24‰/8.5-10.5‰). We provide evidence for the presence of putative sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria in the arctic cladorhizids; however, δ13C and δ15N signatures did not provide evidence for significant chemoautotrophic symbiosis in this case, and the slightly higher abundance of cladorhizids at the JMVF site compared to the nearby deep sea likely stem from an increased abundance of prey rather than a more direct vent association. The phylogenetic position of C. methanophila in relation to other carnivorous sponges was established using a three-gene phylogenetic analysis, and it was found to be closely related to other non-methanotrophic Cladorhiza species with a similar morphology included in the dataset, suggesting a recent origin for methanotrophy in this species. C. methanophila remains the only known carnivorous sponge with a strong, chemolithoautotrophic symbiont association, and methanotrophic symbiosis does not seem to be a widespread property within the Cladorhizidae.","As shown by recent studies, filter-feeding sponges are known to host a wide variety of microorganisms.

Sponges (Porifera) are among the earliest diverging animals and comprise one of the major animal phyla, with over 8,700 species currently described (van Soest et al., 2016) . They have been shown to often live in close association with abundant and highly diverse microbial communities, which can account for up to 35-40% of sponge biomass in some cases Hentschel et al., 2012) . Several studies, in recent years greatly facilitated by the use of next generation sequencing techniques, have identified an extraordinary diversity of microorganisms in sponges from all three domains of life. More than 30 bacterial phyla as well as archaeal and single-celled eukaryotes have been reported, including a candidate phylum, Poribacteria, which is known almost exclusively from sponges (Fieseler et al., 2004; Lafi et al., 2009; Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Within a single sponge, one may find hundreds to thousands of unique microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), some of which are common in marine environments, but many of which tend to be specific to a single host species or group of sponges (Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . The vast majority of sponges obtain nutrients by filtering water through an aquiferous system, and take up particles through choanocyte cells into the interior mesohyl of the sponge where digestion occurs. The mesohyl, an extracellular matrix making up the bulk of the sponge, is populated by motile sponge cells, and provides a habitat for the associated microbiome of the sponge (Bergquist, 1978; Taylor et al., 2007) . Microorganisms benefit from an increased access to nutrients, while in turn providing a variety of functions relating to the metabolism of the host sponge such as nitrogen cycling, carbon fixation, and the production of a vast array of secondary metabolites (e.g., Taylor et al., 2007; Hoffmann et al., 2009 ). Thus, a complete understanding of sponge function is incomplete without taking into account its microbial community, and a sponge could most accurately be considered as the sum of its host cells and associated microbiome. Carnivorous sponges, comprising family Cladorhizidae Dendy, 1922 (Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida) , are the only sponges known to have a partly or completely reduced aquiferous system. These sponges are instead able to capture and engulf prey such as small crustaceans and other planktonic organisms. Cladorhizids are usually erect, with a stalked, pennate, or branching morphology. Prey items become stuck to the adhesive surface and filamentous appendages of the sponge and motile cells migrate to and then envelop the prey, in effect creating a temporary digestive cavity around it (e.g., Kübler and Barthel, 1999; Vacelet and Duport, 2004; Vacelet, 2007) . Currently, around 150 species are recognized, belonging to the nine genera Abyssocladia Lévi, 1964 (around 20 spp.) , Asbestopluma Topsent, 1901 (around 30 spp.) , Cercicladia Ríos et al., 2011 (1 sp.) , Chondrocladia Thomson, 1873 (around 35 spp.) , Cladorhiza Sars, 1872 (around 35 spp.) , Euchelipluma Topsent, 1909 (around 5 spp.) , Koltunicladia Hestetun et al., 2016b (1 sp.) , Lollipocladia Vacelet, 2008 (1 sp.) , and Lycopodina Lundbeck, 1905 (around 25 spp.) (Hestetun et al., 2016b; van Soest et al., 2016) . A remnant aquiferous system is found in genus Chondrocladia, where it is used to inflate spherical swellings for use in prey capture and reproductive purposes rather than filter-feeding (Kübler and Barthel, 1999; Lee et al., 2012) , and other carnivorous sponges completely lack this structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicate at least three bacterial morphotypes in the species Cladorhiza methanophila Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002 from a mud volcano at the base of the Barbados Accretionary Prism (BAP) Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002) , and reported TEM observations from the Pacific species Lycopodina occidentalis (Lambe, 1893) show that bacteriocytes are abundant in the mesohyl, especially in the filaments, in species without known chemoautotrophic symbionts as well (Riesgo et al., 2007) . However, the only known microbiome data currently available for carnivorous sponges is from Dupont et al. (2013 Dupont et al. ( , 2014 , who characterized the microbial community of L. hypogea Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 1996 from a Mediterranean cave. Carnivorous sponges are also of special interest due to the fact that methanotrophic bacteria have been reported in C. methanophila Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002) . In contrast to more well-known chemoautotrophic symbioses in groups such as polychaetes, bivalves or crustaceans (e.g., Felbeck, 1981; Childress et al., 1986; Petersen and Dubilier, 2009) , this is one of only a handful known or suspected vent or seep related chemoautotrophic symbioses within Porifera (Arellano et al., 2013) . Here, we present the results of a comparative study of the microbiomes of 11 specimens representing five cladorhizid species from the Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge including the genera Asbestopluma, Cladorhiza, and Lycopodina, and four specimens representing the species C. methanophila from the BAP, which is known to harbor methanotrophic symbionts. Our aims were to (1) provide additional data on the microbiome composition of carnivorous sponges and compare this to previous sponge microbiome studies, and (2) to compare the microbiome of a known methanotrophic carnivorous sponge to that of other, related carnivorous species and explore the extent of methanotrophy in the sampled species. In order to reach these aims, microbial community structures within sponge specimens were analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons with the Ion Torrent sequencing technology, using primers universal for Bacteria and Archaea, with subsequent amplicon taxonomic assignment and ecological analysis. The ratio of heavy isotopes of e.g., carbon and nitrogen is a common tool for studying food sources and trophic interactions. Very light isotopic ratios indicate organisms with prokaryote symbiosis (Childress et al., 1986; Fry, 2007) , and the microbiome data was supplemented with δ 13 C and δ 15 N stable isotope signatures in order to further investigate methanotrophic or other chemoautotrophic symbiosis in the sample material. Finally, the systematic position of C. methanophila was determined relative to the other carnivorous species based on a phylogenetic analysis also including other available cladorhizid sequences from GenBank. (Pedersen et al., 2010; Schander et al., 2010 ) (all other cladorhizids) (Figure 1) . The mud volcano field at the base of the BAP features massive methane emission from diapiric structures with associated seep fauna mostly belonging to bivalves with chemosynthetic symbionts in additions to large bush-like aggregations of C. methanophila (Olu et al., 1997) . Samples from the JMVF were taken mainly from the Troll Wall site (∼71.25 • N), a part of the rift valley close to Jan Mayen, with an additional specimen from an area of ultradiffuse venting in the rift valley characterized by biofilms dominated by Mariprofundus ferrooxydans (Pedersen et al., 2010) (Figure 2) . Cladorhizids are common in the vicinity of venting sites at the JMVF, but despite the presence of free-living chemoautotrophic microorganisms at these sites (e.g., Lanzén et al., 2011 ) the lack of any large aggregations of biomass like those found at the BAP, could indicate that cladorhizids here benefit more indirectly from the increased prey availability at these sites (Vacelet, 2006) rather than directly deriving nutrition from chemoautotrophic symbionts.   Specimens used for microbiome sequencing were collected primarily using the Bathysaurus ROV during the University of Bergen Centre for Geobiology (CGB) R/V ""G.O. Sars"" 2011 Sars"" , 2012 Sars"" , and 2014 cruises to the JMVF, and with the Jason ROV during the 2012 R/V ""Atlantis"" 21-02 cruise to the base of the BAP. Isotope sampling included additional specimens from CGB ""G.O. Sars"" 2008 Sars"" -2014 cruises. The majority of specimens were either preserved by snap-freezing samples in liquid nitrogen (LN2), or in RNAlater. RNAlater specimens were as a rule kept at normal freezer temperatures (−20 • C) during storage. We were also interested in seeing if a couple of ethanol preserved samples were viable for microbiome sequencing, and for some specimens, we ran parallels from part of the specimen fixed in 96% ethanol, and for two specimens, we sequenced from ethanol preserved material only. A list of cladorhizid specimens used for microbiome sequencing and host phylogenetic analysis is given in Table 1 . Specimens used for isotope analysis are listed together with the results of the analysis in Table 2 . Stable isotope analyses (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) were conducted at the University of Bergen. Samples were dried at 80 • C for 24 h in glass vials and grounded to powder using a glass pestle. Lipids were removed by adding 7% methanol in dichloromethane for 2 h to the dried sample and then removed using a glass Pasteur pipette and again dried for 24 h at 80 • C. Inorganic carbon was removed by adding 0.5 M HCl to the samples. The time for the inorganic carbon to dissolve varied and the HCl was kept at minimum 5 min or until the reaction was finished. Acid waste was washed away by carefully adding and removing water to the sample until the pH reached 6-7. Finally the samples were dried and weighed in tin capsules and measured using a Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer connected to a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer (Thermo Scientific). Isotope ratios are expressed in delta notation as difference in 13 C/ 12 C and 15 N/ 14 N isotope ratios compared to Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) and air N2, respectively. Samples were calibrated to internationally acknowledged C and N isotope ratio standards. Specimen subsamples were examined and visible contaminants removed and rinsed several times using Milli-Q water in a sterile environment. Extraction of grinded tissue was done using either the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc DNA kit (Omega Biotek) or the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit. A water sample from the JMVF was filtered through a 0.22 µm cellulose filter that was cut into small pieces before extraction. Spicules were removed from the extract after lysis before adding ethanol. In order to establish the phylogenetic position of C. methanophila, partial ribosomal 28S rRNA, mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear gene asparagine-linked glycosylation protein 11 (ALG11) were sequenced to allow comparison with existing cladorhizid sequences in GenBank from Hestetun et al. (2016b) , which already includes other cladorhizids part of our study. A maximum likelihood analysis using RAxML 8.0.20 (Stamatakis, 2014) was performed on a concatenated dataset with the resulting ML most likely tree pictured with rapid bootstrap values (BS) indicated. Amplification procedure and analysis are identical to that of Hestetun et al. (2016b) , where they are described in further detail. For 16S rDNA sequencing, we targeted the V4-V5 regions using the universal prokaryote primers 519F (5 -CAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 ) (Øvreås et al., 1997) and 805R (5 -GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3 ) (Herlemann et al., 2011) . Ion Torrent libraries were constructed as described in detail in Jørgensen and Zhao (2016) . In short: all DNA extracts were PCR amplified in triplicates and subsequently pooled and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA was used in a second PCR in order to attach barcodes and adaptor sequence. Resulting amplicons were purified using AMPure XP bead Purification Kit (Agencourt), following the manufacturer's protocol, before all samples were pooled in equimolar concentrations (26 pmol). Prior to sequencing quantification was done using a Quantus Fluorometer. Amplicons were sequenced applying the Ion Torrent PGM Personal Genome Machine (PGM) platform technology (Life Technologies) with a 318 chip. The thermal PCR programs used were as follow: first round PCR: each reaction (20 µl) contained 10 µl 2x HotStarTaq R master mixture (Qiagen), 0.2 µl of each primer (100 µM stock), 2 µl template, and ddH 2 O. The PCR program was initiated with a hot start activation step for 15 min at 95 • C followed by 27 cycles of 95 • C for 30 s, 56 • C for 30 s, and 72 • C for 30 s. Second round PCR used same program but only seven cycles and contained in each reaction (25 µl) contained 12.5 µl 2x HotStarTaq R master mixture (Qiagen), 0.2 µl 806r-B-Key (100 µM stock), and 2 µl 519f MID primer (10 µM stock), with 5 µl of purified PCR products from first-round amplification as the template, according to the Ion Torrent protocol. Filtering (truncate length 200, max expected errors 0.5), chimera detection, removal of singletons, and OTU clustering (97% identity) were done using the UPARSE pipeline with USEARCH 8.1.1861 (Edgar, 2013) . Taxonomic assignment and phylogenetic tree construction was done with the Green Genes database v 13_8 using QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010) , and 16S rRNA amplicon data was submitted to the Sequence Read Archive as biosamples with accession numbers SAMN05722969 and SAMN05722971-SAMN05722981, under BioProject accession number PRJNA341449. Bray-Curtis pairwise dissimilarity index values, cluster and MDS analyses were calculated using R package vegan, and data were visualized using R packages ggplot2 and pheatmap. C. methanophila Sanger sequences for specimens J633-5 (Cmet1) and J636-3 (Cmet4) were uploaded to GenBank with accession numbers KX815331-KX815335.  Stable isotope analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N was done on 15 samples representing five cladorhizid species (Figure 3 ; Table 2 ). The results show that all JMVF cladorhizids had isotope ratios within a quite narrow range of around −22 to −24 for δ 13 C and 8.5 to 10.5 for δ 15 N. The BAP C. methanophila specimens were found to have very light δ 13 C and δ 15 N ratios of around −60 to −66 for δ 13 C and 3.5 to 5.2 for δ 15 N, clearly separating it from the other cladorhizid specimens (Mann-Whitney rank-sum p-value = 0.001465). The Cladorhizidae phylogenetic analysis recovered the two sequenced C. methanophila specimens as a close sister taxon to C. gelida with high support (BS = 100). C. gelida is a common Cladorhiza species with a wide biogeographical distribution and eurybathyal depth range, and is also included in the microbiome dataset here. Other North Atlantic arbuscular Cladorhiza species (C. abyssicola Sars, 1872, C. oxeata Lundbeck, 1905 , C. corticocancellata Carter, 1876 , and C. tenuisigma Lundbeck, 1905 were also recovered as close relatives within the genus (Figure 4) .  We obtained 16S rRNA sequences from 20 samples representing 11 specimens and one water sample. Filtering removed 36.6% of initial unfiltered reads, and the total number of filtered reads was 2,067,945, with individual run ID reads ranging between 25,987 Individual specimens are referred to by sample ID throughout the text. * These specimens were also used in the phylogenetic analysis in this study. Specimens were collected from the JMVF except C. methanophila specimens, which were collected at the base of the BAP. Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org and 207,572. Total number of unique reads was 349,835. Filtered reads were clustered into 2,005 OTUs using a 97% identity threshold ( Table 3) . Multiple replicates from the same specimen were pooled together in subsequent analyses. In order to mitigate biases from variable sequencing depth, pooled samples were subsampled to a standard depth of 45,000 reads for all subsequent analyses (smallest pooled sample was ∼49,000 reads). Checking for any systematic bias in taxonomic assignments due to extraction kit, we did not see any consistent difference between samples extracted with the Qiagen kit (Afur1 1-3, Afur2, Caby1, Ccor1, Cgel1, Cgel2 2-13, Cmet4 2-8) and the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc kit (Afur1 1-2; Cgel2 2-11 and 2-12; all Cmet1, Cmet2, and Cmet3; Cmet4 2-7; Lcup1; Wat1) ( Figure 5) . Looking at the viability of EtOH as fixative (in this particular case, with comparatively fresh specimens kept in cold storage) for samples Caby1, Ccor1, Cgel2 2-11, Cmet1 2-1, and Cmet2 2-4, we found no difference for the Cmet samples, but samples Caby1, Ccor1, and Cgel2 showed a comparatively large abundance of Thiohalorhabdales (Gammaproteobacteria) compared to other samples (and replicates in the case of Cgel2) (Figure 5) . While the variable abundance of Thiohalorhabdales is consistent with earlier results showing that prokaryote concentration is variable throughout the sponge (see section ""Comparison with Other Sponge Microbiomes""), and could thus be attributable to sampling location as the Thiohalorhabdales abundance is also variable for the two non-EtOH replicates of Cgel2, it is also possible that the EtOH fixative has influenced relative abundance for these three samples, which has been taken into account in the relevant discussion. At the phylum level, 97% OTUs were classified into 41 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla, with between 15 and 36 phyla for individual FIGURE 4 | A maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of the carnivorous sponge family Cladorhizidae based on a concatenated dataset of partial 28S rDNA, COI and ALG11 (2859 bp), showing the position of C. methanophila (bold).

The most common prokaryotes at class level are given in Figure 6 . The 10 most common groups at genus level are given in table form in Table 4 , and a heatmap showing overlap in identity between specimens at genus level is given in Figure 7 . Carnivorous sponge samples were dominated by a combination of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and Thaumarchaeota. The JMVF water sample also included smaller amounts of additional phyla including Verrucomicrobia, Tenericutes, SAR406, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Euryarchaeota. At the class level, Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class in Asbestopluma (Asbestopluma) furcata and C. methanophila. It also completely dominated the C. abyssicola and C. corticocancellata samples, while other Cladorhiza samples were more mixed. Alphaproteobacteria were also present in all samples, and had a large presence in some Cladorhiza samples and L. cupressiformis. Flavobacteriia were most abundant in L. cupressiformis, and were also present in other samples to varying degrees. Within the Gammaproteobacteria, an unknown genus and family of Thiohalorhabdales was present in all cladorhizid samples. The abundance varied greatly between samples: While the C. abyssicola and C. corticocancellata samples had over 90% reads from this group (but see caveat regarding sample fixation, section ""Run Statistics""), other samples averaged 30% (C. gelida specimen 2), ∼10-20% (A. furcata) or less than 10% for the rest of the samples. The order Oceanospirillales, was prominent in several samples, most significantly in the two A. furcata specimens (57.7 and 65.8%), and to a lesser degree in C. methanophila (∼15-25%) and L. cupressiformis (6.0%), but absent in other Cladorhiza samples. Most of the Oceanospirillales reads were associated with the SUP05 clade, but two other groups were present in smaller quantities as well. The obligate methanotrophic order Methylococcales (Bowman, 2005) was present in C. methanophila only, where it was one of the major groups in terms of abundance (16-25%). Another group found almost exclusively in C. methanophila was the order Thiotrichales (5-10%). The Alphaproteobacteria were mainly represented by Rhodobacterales, especially Octadecabacter, which was present in large quantities in C. gelida (20-40%), in lesser quantities in C. methanophila (3.9-6.0%) and L. cupressiformis (7.7%) and Multiple samples from the same specimen are indicated with specimen numbering and color. Run ID comprises run (1 or 2) and MID. Unique OTUs are with singletons and chimeras removed. Statistics for aggregated run lists unique reads, singletons and unique OTUs across the entire dataset. Samples from the same specimen were pooled together, and sequencing depth standardized to 45000 reads, for subsequent analyses. almost absent in A. furcata, C. abyssicola, and C. corticocancellata (0-1.2%). Another unknown Rhodobacteraceae was present in slightly lower overall quantities: 17.3% in L. cupressiformis, 5-10% in C. gelida and low amounts in other samples (0-1.5%). The main part of Flavobacteriia reads were identified as Polaribacter with 35.6% abundance in L. cupressiformis, over 20% abundance in C. methanophila and C. gelida, and lower values in the range of 2.6-7.4% for A. furcata, C. abyssicola,  Values 5% and above in bold. and C. corticocancellata. A second group of Flavobacteriaceae was also present in the case of L. cupressiformis (16.2%), making the total for Flavobacteriaceae over 50% in this specimen. The only archaeal group found in any significant amount was Nitrosopumilus from the Thaumarchaeota Marine Group 1, which was found in moderate amounts (16-22%) in C. gelida and low amounts (0-2.4%) in other samples. Bray-Curtis normalized distances were calculated between specimens on the subsampled microbiome abundance dataset in order to identify systematic differences in microbiome composition. The Bray-Curtis distances were used to perform a hierarchical average linking clustering and NMDS analyses at the 97% OTU level (Figure 8) . The cluster analysis recovered the water sample in a root position with one clade of C. methanophila, L. cupressiformis, and C. gelida and one clade of C. abyssicola, C. corticocancellata, and A. furcata. However, results show small Bray-Curtis distances (0.7-0.9) between these clades. The NMDS analysis recovered the water sample some distance away from the cladorhizid samples, which broadly cluster in one clade containing C. gelida and C. methanophila, and one clade containing C. abyssicola, C. corticocancellata, and A. furcata.  Our results represent the first comparative study of microbiome composition in carnivorous sponges, expanding on the results of the single-species carnivorous sponge study by Dupont et al. (2013) as well as providing a reference for comparison against larger studies of non-carnivorous sponges like Thomas et al. (2016) and deep-sea sponges such as Kennedy et al. (2014) . The class level microbiome community structures observed in this study are similar to previously published filter-feeding sponge microbiomes, with a dominance of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria (Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Other major groups in our study are Bacteroidetes and Thaumarchaeota, and Bacteroidetes was found to be the dominating group in L. cupressiformis (Figure 6) . Thaumarchaeota are often found as a secondary group in several studies Thomas et al., 2016) . Reports of Bacteroidetes are less common, but have been reported for deep-sea sponges (Kennedy et al., 2014) , including the previously sequenced microbiome of the carnivorous sponge L. hypogea (Dupont et al., 2013) . At higher taxonomic resolution (family and genus level), large variation in the different species microbiomes is evident (Figure 7) . This is consistent with previous surveys reporting on high degrees of host specificity among sponge microbiomes (Hentschel et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Moreover, some of the results from sequencing multiple replicates from the same specimen ( Figure 5) show considerable variation also within each sample, especially for Thiohalorhabdales. While it is possible that the fixative has partly influenced the results in this particular case here (see section ""Run Statistics""), the results are in accordance with an uneven distribution of microbial organisms within the host sponges, as previously reported through TEM observations by Riesgo et al. (2007) . Interestingly, an unknown Thiohalorhabdales, and Oceanospirillales, both from the SUP05 clade as well as others, were abundant across all species in the dataset (Figure 7 ; Table 4 ). The only described species of Thiohalorhabdales is Thiohalorhabdus denitrificans, an obligate chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium from hypersaline habitats (Sorokin et al., 2008) . Thiohalorhabdales have been reported in low concentrations from sea water with abundance correlated with nitrite concentration (Frank et al., 2016) . The Oceanospirillales SUP05 group is also associated with sulfur oxidation, partly at vent and seep sites (Anantharaman et al., 2013) . It has been reported both as free-living bacteria and as an endosymbiont (Marshall and Morris, 2013) . We found small to moderate amounts of Thaumarchaeota Marine Group 1 reads belonging to Nitrosopumilus in parts of our dataset (Figure 7; Table 4) , mainly in the case of C. gelida. This group was also found in moderate quantities in the JMVF water sample. Members of Nitrosopumilus are common in seawater and grow by oxidizing ammonium to nitrite (Könneke et al., 2005) . Interestingly, sponge symbiont archaeal nitrification has been reported from several studies (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; Radax et al., 2012) , and Nitrosopumilus was also found to be the dominating archaeon in part of the specimens in the deep-sea sponges in Kennedy et al. (2014) , implying a possible role for this group within carnivorous sponges. Sulfur-and ammonia-oxidizing symbionts seem to be common in non-carnivorous deep-sea sponges (Nishijima et al., 2010; Arellano et al., 2013) , implying that chemolithoautotrophy could be a widespread supplementary source of nutrition for deep-sea sponges in general (Kennedy et al., 2014) . Though the taxonomic affinity of the major putative sulfur-oxidizing groups in our dataset (Thiohalorhabdales, Oceanospirillales) were partly different than that of Kennedy et al. (2014) (chiefly Chromatiales, but also some Oceanospirillales and others), this raises the possibility that partial nutrient acquisition from sulfur oxidation could be common in carnivorous sponges as well, though as evidenced by the isotope signatures from our study (Figure 3 ) such activity would be a supplement to carnivory rather than the major mode of nutrition. Other significant groups present in the dataset were identified as associated with several marine bacterial taxa: For the Alphaproteobacteria, the two major OTUs were somewhat evenly split between an unknown Rhodobacteraceae and the marine genus Octadecabacter. The Bacteroidetes were, excepting an unknown Flavobacteriaceae in L. cupressiformis, almost exclusively Polaribacter, a genus containing several gas vacuolated, marine bacterial species (Gosink et al., 1998) (Figure 7 ; Table 4 ). (For Methylococcales, see section ""Trophic Considerations and Extent of Methanotrophy in Carnivorous Sponges""). The habit of C. methanophila is arbuscular, with a great number of filaments extending in all directions from the branches. Together with the types and sizes of its skeletal spicules, the morphology is similar to and suggests a close affinity to a group of Cladorhiza species from the North Atlantic. This group includes the three species C. abyssicola (type species of the genus), C. corticocancellata and C. gelida, also examined here, as well as C. iniquidentata Lundbeck (1905) , C. oxeata, and C. tenuisigma (Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002; Hestetun et al., in press ). The phylogenetic relationships and systematic classification of the carnivorous sponges were investigated in a recent study (Hestetun et al., 2016b) , which included most of the North Atlantic cladorhizid species, and sequences from that study were used here with the addition of C. methanophila in order to recover its phylogenetic position. In view of the morphological similarities, the recovery of C. methanophila as a close sister taxon to the other arbuscular North Atlantic Cladorhiza species in the dataset (Figure 4) is not very surprising. C. methanophila has also been reported from the 15 • 20 N fracture zone segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hestetun et al., 2015) , and has a known depth range of 2600-4900 m. Most other arbuscular Cladorhiza species have a somewhat shallower distribution (mainly 200-2000 m), but the closest sister taxon, C. gelida, has a eurybathyal range, reported from 500 to 3500 m (Hestetun et al., in press) . Given the lack of any evidence of methanotrophic symbiosis in other closely related cladorhizids in the dataset here, a likely hypothesis is that methanotrophy in C. methanophila is a rather recent event, possibly occurring as an adaptation to a vent or seep locality either at the BAP or the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As deep-sea sponges, cladorhizids are often found in greater concentrations in the enrichment zones surrounding vent and seep systems, where prey is comparatively abundant. However, the large size and great abundance of the shrub-like aggregations of C. methanophila at the BAP greatly exceeds normal concentrations of carnivorous sponges, even at other vent sites. Though captured prey items show that C. methanophila still retains the ability to acquire nutrients through prey capture (Vacelet and Boury-Esnault, 2002) , this suggests that this sponge is able to derive a large amount of nutrients from its chemoautotrophic association Olu et al., 1997 ) (compare Figure 2 for a visual impression) . Results showed that an undescribed Methylococcales OTU was recovered in large abundance from C. methanophila specimens, supporting earlier findings describing symbiosis between this species and methanotrophic symbionts. The isotope results, in particular the very light δ 13 C ratios of −60.5 to −66.0 , are very strong indicators of a symbiotic origin for organic carbon in the host sponge, and consistent with δ 13 C ratios reported in other symbioses from e.g., Gulf of Mexico vent (−51 to −57 ) (Childress et al., 1986) and seep (−74 ) (Cavanaugh et al., 1987) (−45.4 to −39.6 and −68.4 to −78.8 ) (MacAvoy et al., 2002) mussels. Surprisingly, they are also lighter than ratios reported for C. methanophila from the BAP by (−48.4 to −48.8 ), which could be related to changes in source carbon signature or precise sampling location. The high sponge concentrations at the BAP, previous TEM and isotope values (e.g., , and microbiome and isotope results from our study (Figure 3; Table 2 ), clearly show that this species obtains a majority of nutrients from its symbiont relationship rather than through prey capture. The only other sponge where methanotrophic symbiosis has been reported is Myxilla (Ectyomyxilla) methanophila Maldonado and Young (1998) . However, here the dominating methanotroph is Methylohalomonas (Chromatiales, Ectothiorhodospiraceae) (Arellano et al., 2013) . In contrast to C. methanophila, close relatives including C. abyssicola, C. corticocancellata, and C. gelida, did not have isotopic ratios suggesting a large contribution from chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis (Figure 3 ) (see Sweetman et al., 2013 for other JMVF biota). Gammaproteobacteria in groups related to known sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were prominent in the microbiome across different cladorhizids in this study. Hydrogen sulfide is present in high concentrations in the high-temperature fluids venting from white smokers at the Troll Wall site at the JMVF (Baumberger, 2011; Dahle et al., 2015) . However, sulfur oxidation, which seems to be a common feature in deepsea sponges, may, if indeed it signifies chemolithoautotrophy, account for a smaller portion of the nutrient uptake than the methanotrophic symbiosis in C. methanophila. Thus, chemolithoautotrophic symbiosis as a dominant form of nutrient acquisition within carnivorous sponges seems to be an isolated case rather than a more widespread phenomenon in currently reported species. Taken together, the microbiome structures seen in our dataset show a similar dominance of Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria as that reported for filter-feeding sponges, with some deviation in less dominant groups such as Bacteroidetes and Thaumarchaeota. However, more interestingly, they display marked functional similarities to the results of the filter-feeding (i.e., noncarnivorous) deep-sea sponge species examined by Kennedy et al. (2014) at a higher resolution, sharing ammonia-oxidizing taxa (Nitrosopumilus) and both having significant abundances of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Thus, it seems that carnivorous sponges overlap with other deep-sea filter-feeding sponges in the functional properties of major groups of their microbiome, though the lack of other comparative data makes it difficult to ascertain whether these taxonomic differences represent a carnivorous sponge-specific microbiome. The phylogenetic analysis shows that C. methanophila is a close relative of other North-Atlantic Cladorhiza species. While it is difficult to assess the importance of sulfur and ammonia oxidation in the metabolism of carnivorous sponges in general from the data presented here, the large quantities of methanotrophic symbiont bacteria and low isotopic signature of C. methanophila are clear indications that this species relies to a large degree on its chemoautotrophic symbionts, an association that seems to have evolved in this species as a special case rather than in a larger number of related carnivorous sponges.

The volcano is daily emitting ash and pyroclastic materials since September 2013 to the present, damaging agroecosystems and costing for management restoration. The objective of the study was to assess properties and impacts of pristine volcanic material depositions on soil properties and to provide management options for restoring the affected agroecosytem. Land satellite imagery was used for field studies to observe the distribution, thickness and properties of ashfall deposition. The pristine ashfall deposits and the underlying soils were sampled for mineralogical, soluble salt, chemical, physical and toxic compound analyses. Results showed that uneven distribution of rainfall at the time of violent eruption caused the areas receiving mud ashfall developed surface encrustation, which was not occur in areas receiving dry ashfall. Ashfall damaged the agroecosytem by burning vegetation, forming surface crusts, and creating soil acidity and toxicity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses of encrustated layer indicated the presence of gypsum and jarosite minerals. Gypsum likely acted as a cementing agent in the formation of the encrustation layer with extremely low pH (2.9) and extremely high concentrations of Al, Ca and S. Encrustation is responsible for limited water infiltration and root penetration, while the extremely high concentration of Al is responsible for crop toxicity. Mud ashfall and dry ashfall deposits also greatly changed the underlying soil properties by decreasing soil pH and cation exchange capacity and by increasing exchangeable Ca, Al, and S availability. Despite damaging vegetation in the short-term, the volcanic ashfall enriched the soil in the longer term by adding nutrients like Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, Si and S. Suggested management practices to help restore the agroecosystem after volcanic eruptions include: (i) the application of lime to increase soil pH, increase cation exchange capacity and decrease Al and S toxicities, (ii) the selection of crops which are tolerant to low pH and high concentrations of soluble Al and S, (iii) physically disrupting the hard surface crusts that form on some soils (if <2 cm thick) to allow water infiltration and root penetration, (iv) application of N and K fertilizers, and (v) incorporation of dry ashfall into the soil (if <5 cm thick) to exploit the newly deposited nutrients.",N/A,Markus Anda,2016,26599148,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.157

31297440,"Endosymbioses between bacteria and deep-sea siboglinid tubeworms from an Arctic Cold Seep (Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano, Barents Sea)","Siboglinid tubeworms do not have a mouth or gut and live in obligate associations with bacterial endosymbionts. Little is currently known about the phylogeny of frenulate and moniliferan siboglinids and their symbionts. In this study, we investigated the symbioses of two co-occurring siboglinid species from a methane emitting mud volcano in the Arctic Ocean (Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano, HMMV): Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis (Frenulata) and Sclerolinum contortum (Monilifera). Comparative sequence analysis of the host-specific 18S and the symbiont-specific 16S rRNA genes of S. contortum showed that the close phylogenetic relationship of this host to vestimentiferan siboglinids was mirrored in the close relationship of its symbionts to the sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacterial symbionts of vestimentiferans. A similar congruence between host and symbiont phylogeny was observed in O. haakonmosbiensis: both this host and its symbionts were most closely related to the frenulate siboglinid O. mashikoi and its gammaproteobacterial symbiont. The symbiont sequences from O. haakonmosbiensis and O. mashikoi formed a clade unaffiliated with known methane- or sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that the dominant bacterial phylotypes originated from endosymbionts residing inside the host trophosome. In both S. contortum and O. haakonmosbiensis, characteristic genes for autotrophy (cbbLM) and sulfur oxidation (aprA) were present, while genes diagnostic for methanotrophy were not detected. The molecular data suggest that both HMMV tubeworm species harbour chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing symbionts. In S. contortum, average stable carbon isotope values of fatty acids and cholesterol of -43 per thousand were highly negative for a sulfur oxidizing symbiosis, but can be explained by a (13)C-depleted CO(2) source at HMMV. In O. haakonmosbiensis, stable carbon isotope values of fatty acids and cholesterol of -70 per thousand are difficult to reconcile with our current knowledge of isotope signatures for chemoautotrophic processes.",N/A,Tina Lösekann,2008,18707616,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01712.x
20646286,Characterization of methanogenic and prokaryotic assemblages based onmcrAand 16S rRNA gene diversity in sediments of the Kazan mud volcano (Mediterranean Sea),"The diversity of the methyl-coenzyme reductase A (mcrA) and 16S rRNA genes was investigated in gas hydrate containing sediment from the Kazan mud volcano, eastern Mediterranean Sea. mcrA was detected only at 15 and 20 cm below seafloor (cmbsf) from a 40-cm long push core, while based on chemical profiles of methane, sulfate, and sulfide, possible anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) depth was inferred at 12-15 cmbsf. The phylogenetic relationships of the obtained mcrA, archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA genes, showed that all the found sequences were found in both depths and at similar relative abundances. mcrA diversity was low. All sequences were related to the Methanosarcinales, with the most dominant (77.2%) sequences falling in group mcrA-e. The 16S rRNA-based archaeal diversity also revealed low diversity and clear dominance (72.8% of all archaeal phylotypes) of the Methanosarcinales and, in particular, ANME-2c. Bacteria showed higher diversity but 83.2% of the retrieved phylotypes from both sediment layers belonged to the delta-Proteobacteria. These phylotypes fell in the SEEP-SRB1 putative AOM group. In addition, the rest of the less abundant phylotypes were related to yet-uncultivated representatives of the Actinobacteria, Spirochaetales, and candidate divisions OP11 and WS3 from gas hydrate-bearing habitats. These phylotype patterns indicate that AOM is occurring in the 15 and 20 cmbsf sediment layers.",N/A,K. A. KORMAS,2008,19076636,10.1111/j.1472-4669.2008.00172.x
25614269,Prokaryotic diversity and metabolically active microbial populations in sediments from an active mud volcano in the Gulf of Mexico.,"In this study, ribosomes and genomic DNA were extracted from three sediment depths (0-2, 6-8 and 10-12 cm) to determine the vertical changes in the microbial community composition and identify metabolically active microbial populations in sediments obtained from an active seafloor mud volcano site in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Domain-specific Bacteria and Archaea 16S polymerase chain reaction primers were used to amplify 16S rDNA gene sequences from extracted DNA. Complementary 16S ribosomal DNA (crDNA) was obtained from rRNA extracted from each sediment depth that had been subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification. Twelve different 16S clone libraries, representing the three sediment depths, were constructed and a total of 154 rDNA (DNA-derived) and 142 crDNA (RNA-derived) Bacteria clones and 134 rDNA and 146 crDNA Archaea clones obtained. Analyses of the 576 clones revealed distinct differences in the composition and patterns of metabolically active microbial phylotypes relative to sediment depth. For example, epsilon-Proteobacteria rDNA clones dominated the 0-2 cm clone library whereas gamma-Proteobacteria dominated the 0-2 cm crDNA library suggesting gamma to be among the most active in situ populations detected at 0-2 cm. Some microbial lineages, although detected at a frequency as high as 9% or greater in the total DNA library (i.e. Actinobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria), were markedly absent from the RNA-derived libraries suggesting a lack of in situ activity at any depth in the mud volcano sediments. This study is one of the first to report the composition of the microbial assemblages and physiologically active members of archaeal and bacterial populations extant in a Gulf of Mexico submarine mud volcano.",N/A,Robert Martinez,2006,16958759,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01063.x
4773405,Subduction zone forearc serpentinites as incubators for deep microbial life,"Serpentinization-fueled systems in the cool, hydrated forearc mantle of subduction zones may provide an environment that supports deep chemolithoautotrophic life. Here, we examine serpentinite clasts expelled from mud volcanoes above the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction zone forearc (Pacific Ocean) that contain complex organic matter and nanosized Ni-Fe alloys. Using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy, we determined that the organic matter consists of a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic compounds and functional groups such as amides. Although an abiotic or subduction slab-derived fluid origin cannot be excluded, the similarities between the molecular signatures identified in the clasts and those of bacteria-derived biopolymers from other serpentinizing systems hint at the possibility of deep microbial life within the forearc. To test this hypothesis, we coupled the currently known temperature limit for life, 122 °C, with a heat conduction model that predicts a potential depth limit for life within the forearc at ∼10,000 m below the seafloor. This is deeper than the 122 °C isotherm in known oceanic serpentinizing regions and an order of magnitude deeper than the downhole temperature at the serpentinized Atlantis Massif oceanic core complex, Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We suggest that the organic-rich serpentinites may be indicators for microbial life deep within or below the mud volcano. Thus, the hydrated forearc mantle may represent one of Earth's largest hidden microbial ecosystems. These types of protected ecosystems may have allowed the deep biosphere to thrive, despite violent phases during Earth's history such as the late heavy bombardment and global mass extinctions.","Serpentinization-fueled systems in the cool, hydrated forearc mantle of subduction zones may provide an environment that supports deep chemolithoautotrophic life.

For example, redox-coupled reactions during serpentinization, the formation of serpentine [(Mg,Fe) 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 ] through mantle olivine [(Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 ] hydration, generate substantial amounts of H 2 (2) . Although serpentinization leads to extreme pH conditions and limited nutrient and electron acceptor availability (1) , microgenomic studies of serpentinization-fueled hydrothermal deep-sea vents and continental fluid seeps show evidence for microbial H 2 and CH 4 utilization (1, (3) (4) (5) . Furthermore, micrometer-sized organic matter has been detected in dredged seafloor serpentinites (6) and in subseafloor mixing zones between seawater and serpentinization-derived fluid (7) . The former study suggests that serpentinization-fueled microbial communities may use solid electron acceptors, particularly ferric iron from magnetite (Fe 2 (Fig. 1) can potentially provide just such a window into the deep biosphere. The mud volcanoes source their serpentine from >20-km depth via deep-reaching forearc faults, where serpentinite gouges mix with slab-derived fluids before buoyantly rising toward the seafloor (10). The IBM subduction zone is a convergent plate margin ranging over ∼2,800 km from near Tokyo (Japan) to south of Guam (Mariana Islands; Fig. 1 ). The IBM is located along the eastern margin of the Philippine Sea Plate in the Western Pacific Ocean and formed due to the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Philippine Sea Plate (11) . The southern boundary is marked by the intersection of the IBM trench with the Palau-Kyushu Ridge at 11°N. The northern boundary is at 35°20′N close to southern Honshu, Japan (12) . The eastern boundary extends along a deep-sea trench and ranges in depth from 3 km at the Ogasawara Plateau (trench entrance) to ∼11-km depth within the Challenger Deep-the deepest site in the world. The Mariana forearc is pervasively faulted by tectonic activity and only minor sediment accretion occurs along the margin (9, 13). As the Pacific Plate descends, oceanic upper mantle, oceanic crust, overlaying sediment, and water are transported into the forearc mantle. Some of this material is transferred from the subducting slab into the overlying mantle and oceanic plate, where large quantities of fluids rise through faults and fractures, carrying dissolved We document organic matter encapsulated in rock clasts from a oceanic serpentinite mud volcano above the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction zone (Pacific Ocean). Although we cannot pinpoint the exact origin of the organic matter, chemical analysis of the constituents resembles molecular signatures that could be produced by microbial life deep within or below the mud volcano. Considering the known temperature limit for life, 122°C, and the subduction zone forearc geotherm where such mud volcanoes are located, we estimate that life could exist as deep as ∼10,000 m below the seafloor. This is considerably deeper than other active serpentinizing regions such as midocean ridges and could have provided sheltered ecosystems for life to survive the more violent phases of Earth's history.

These fluids can either vent as cold springs onto the seafloor (14) or hydrate and serpentinize the mantle wedge. The latter is supported by deep-sea drilling and geophysical measurements showing that at least part of the Mariana forearc mantle wedge is hydrated (15, 16) . Within the deep-reaching forearc faults, serpentinite fault gouges mix with the rising slabderived fluids. This mud-rock mixture buoyantly rises in conduits along fault planes until it extrudes onto the seafloor to form various kilometer-scale seamounts, that is, mud volcanoes, predominantly composed of serpentinite, situated on the outer forearc of the Mariana margin (e.g., ref. 17) (Fig. 1B) . The mud volcanoes are located in a trench-parallel zone ∼30-100 km arcward of the trench axis and reach up to 50 km in diameter and over 2 km in height (17, 18) . Unconsolidated flows of clay-to silt-sized serpentinite mud enclose up to boulder-sized rock clasts of variably serpentinized mantle peridotite and subordinately blueschist-facies fragments (18) . The samples studied here are recovered from drill cores taken from the South Chamorro serpentine mud volcano (13°47′N, 146°00′E; Fig. 1B ) drilled during ODP Leg 195 (19) . The seamount is a partly collapsed, roughly conical structure ∼2-km high and ∼20-km wide with active serpentine/blueschist mud volcanism. The subducting slab beneath the serpentinite mud volcano is at ∼20-km depth (14, 18) . We studied 46 clasts recovered at depths of 14.80 (1200E-004-02WR-130-140), 28.70 (1200E-007H-02WR-130-140), and 110.07 m below seafloor (mbsf) (1200A-013R-02W-40877). All clasts show a serpentinite mesh texture, where lizardite veins assemble as a mesh framework encompassing central mesh cores (Fig. 2 A and B) . Mesh cores are typically composed of chrysotile, or occasionally a mixture of lizardite and chrysotile. In some instances, lizardite fully overgrows the mesh core region (SI Raman Spectroscopy). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) detected aliphatic ion species and ionic units within the mesh cores from a clast retrieved from 14.80 mbsf ( Fig. 2 C-E). These ion clusters have previously been used as indicators for the presence of the amino acids methionine, C 5 H 11 NO 2 S, and threonine, C 4 H 9 NO 3 (20) , but could arise from other organic molecules with a similar mass. Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy corroborates the ToF-SIMS findings showing the presence of amide functional groups within the organic material as well as aliphatic and aromatic functional groups (Fig. 2F) . Hyperspectral Raman imaging (Methods and SI Raman Spectroscopy) reveals the almost exclusive accumulation of such structural components of organic compounds within the mesh cores ( Fig. 2G ), in agreement with the ToF-SIMS results ( Fig. 2 C-E). Clasts retrieved from greater depth within the ODP Leg 195 core (110.07 mbsf) display nearly identical Raman spectra indicative of organic material (Fig. 2F) . However, the additional N(C-C) stretching mode is absent, likely reflecting varying degrees of maturity. Brucite and magnetite associated with lizardite within the clasts constrains the serpentinization temperature to below 300°C (21) . We also identified nanosized (50-350 nm) awaruite (Ni 2-3 Fe) grains embedded within and in the vicinity of the mesh cores ( shown in Fig. 4A , the visible median pore size is ∼25 nm. However, considerably larger pore structures, exceeding several micrometers, can be found in other mesh cores (Fig. 3A) . Pore formation is likely the result of several factors such as imperfect packing of randomly orientated serpentine grains as typically observed in serpentinite mesh cores (22) , chrysotile nanopores (22, 23) , prolonged exposure to upwelling subduction zone fluids inducing mineral dissolution, and/or decompression cracking during upward migration along faults or within the mud volcano conduit. Mesh rims are typically characterized by fewer, micrometer-sized pores (Fig. 4 B and C) as well as mesopores (i.e., 2-50 nm) in the vicinity of mesh cores and around awaruite grain clusters (Fig.  3C) . The anisotropic pore alignment (Fig. 4A ) and complex pore contrast (Fig. 4B) indicate that the mesh cores contain a partially connected pore network. The intricate relationship between the serpentine and organic matter (Fig. 2) , however, suggests that the detected pore sizes are substantially underestimated as the organic material within the pores obscures the true pore size that is likely orders of magnitude larger. Although we cannot unambiguously assign the source of the organic matter, several steps can be taken toward better constraining its potential origin. Upon contact with seawater, the high pH (∼12.6) pore fluids with high alkalinity (100 mmol/kg) within the muds found at the South Chamorro mud volcano should trigger immediate carbonate precipitation (24) . The absence of any carbonate within the clast-bearing mud layers from 28.70 and 110.07 mbsf thus suggests that, although the clasts were erupted onto the seafloor, they were never exposed to seawater and thus seawater-derived organic matter. Additionally, organic matter was only identified in the internal regions of the serpentinite clasts after cross-sectional opening of the clasts (Fig. 2A) . Therefore, it seems unlikely that the organic matter was introduced during shipboard sampling, storage, or sample preparation (Methods). Other potential sources would be organic matter derived from subducted pelagic sediments or in situ production within the forearc system via abiotic or biological processes. Isotope studies suggest influx of fluids derived from a mixture of subducted pelagic sediments and altered oceanic crust into the forearc mantle facilitating serpentinization (25) . However, their sources remain controversial (26) (27) (28) , and the nature of the organic material that is potentially carried with these fluids is largely unknown. Abiotic routes have been demonstrated to produce hydrocarbons and amino acids under hydrothermal conditions akin to serpentinization (29) , but it is unclear whether these processes can produce the organic complexity observed in the serpentinite clasts. Intriguingly, similar Raman spectra to those reported here have been documented in other serpentinites and correlate with spectra taken from bacteria (6) and the presence of bacterial lipid biomarkers (7) . Moreover, the acquired Raman spectra (Fig. 2F) show bands in similar positions to those attributed to functional modes typically found in bacteria-derived biopolymers, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (30, 31) , indicating that the organics may have a biological source. To test whether microbial life is a feasible source of the organic matter observed, we need to establish an estimate for the depth limit for life within the Mariana forearc. As microbial organisms can survive temperatures as high as 122°C (32) and pressures into the gigapascal range (33), we estimated the potential depth limit for microbial life in this region using a one-dimensional steadystate heat conduction model (34) (SI Estimation of the Maximum Depth for the Current Temperature Limit for Life). In this calculation, heat is transferred in one direction without consideration of minor advective heat flow through the ascending mud or heat generated through the exothermic serpentinization reaction. Both of these processes are expected to only play a minor role. Particularly heat through serpentinization has been shown to be nearly negligible (35) . Assuming no variations in temperature or heat flow, the basic equation of conductive heat transfer theory is a statement of conservation of energy and can be written as follows: where T and T 0 are the temperature at depth and at the ocean floor, y is the depth in meters below seafloor, q 0 is the surface heat flow (0.03 W·m −2 ), k is the thermal rock conductivity (2.9 W·m , ρ is the density (2,900 kg·m −3 , partially serpentinized peridotite), and H is the current mean mantle heat generation rate due to radioactive decay (7.42 × 10 −12 W·kg −1 ) (34). At relatively shallow forearc depths, H will only play a minor role. Rearranging the equation above to solve for y at a given temperature (i.e., the known temperature limit for life at 122°C) results in the following: where y + is a nonphysical solution and thus disregarded.  −1 is used. Using these values, the maximum depth for the 122°C isotherm varies between ∼8,000 and 15,000 mbsf (Fig. 5C ). These depth estimates are based on surface heat flow values of 0.03-0.04 W·m −2 that agree with the observed depression of isotherms in most forearc mantle wedges, even those of relatively hot origin such as the Cascadia subduction zone (38, 39) . Moreover, our thermal calculations are in agreement with more complex geodynamic models (40, 41) , confirming that the 122°C isotherm is reached at ∼10,000 mbsf in forearcs. Hence, current serpentinization-fueled microbial life within subduction zone forearcs could be supported down to these depths and corresponding pressure (∼0.34 GPa; Fig. 5 ). In contrast, habitable zones in the vicinity of oceanic spreading centers are limited to the first hundred meters to few kilometers below the seafloor. The exact location of the 122°C isotherm will likely vary in depth at and around the spreading center as a result of the ridge architecture, heat flux, and hydrothermal circulation (42, 43) . The downhole temperature within the International Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Hole U1309D at Atlantis Massif oceanic core complex (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) places the 122°C upper temperature limit for microbial life at ∼1,000 mbsf (44) . This is one order of magnitude less than compared with our estimated limit of life in the Mariana subduction zone forearc. As the serpentinite mud originates directly from the forearc mantle wedge (>20-km depth), the model indicates the potential for a biosphere deep within the forearc. This makes the Mariana serpentinite clasts a natural laboratory of prime interest when searching for habitable zones of life deep within the lithosphere. To sustain deep microbial life within a solid rock framework requires energy resources that can either migrate or be produced close to areas suitable for colonization. There is little to no chemical benefit for microbes to interact directly with serpentine minerals; thus, other life-supporting energy-generating pathways need to be present. Microgenomic studies show evidence for microbial H 2 and CH 4 utilization in serpentinizing systems with known microbial colonization. Indeed, several studies (e.g., ref. Archaea found up to 20 mbsf within the South Chamorro mud volcano are fueled by deeply derived CH 4 -enriched fluids. Experiments suggest that H 2 produced during low-temperature serpentinization (<200°C) (45) could react with a carbon source to form CH 4 on catalytic mineral surfaces. Investigations of naturally occurring abiogenic CH 4 indicate that abiotic hydrocarbon synthesis can potentially take place at temperatures as low as ∼120°C (46). However, there are contrasting experimental results concerning the formation and synthesis kinetics of CH 4 production at (very) low temperatures (47) (48) (49) . In hydrothermal experiments, awaruite has been identified as a possible CH 4 production catalyst (50) . The awaruite grains observed here are nanosized (Fig. 3C ) and, therefore, have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which should enhance their catalytic activity (51) . Thus, nanosized alloys could have facilitated CH 4 production over geologically relevant timescales below the upper temperature limit for life (122°C). In near-surface serpentinizing systems, hydrothermal fluids can mix with, for example, seawater, resulting in disequilibria that may provide the energy and substrates needed to support chemolithoautotrophic life (7) . In contrast, a slowly ascending serpentinite mud along deep-reaching forearc faults may allow the system to remain much closer to equilibrium, regulating the activities of H 2 , CH 4 , CO 2 , and the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio in the solids and fluids limiting energy sources. Nielsen et al. (25) , however, documented the occurrence of rodingite within the Mariana serpentinite mud volcanoes derived from in situ alteration within the forearc mantle. These rocks suggest hydrothermal interactions between . Conceptual model of a deep biosphere environment within the IBM subduction zone forearc with limit for serpentinization-fueled microbial life estimated at 10,000 mbsf based on the known upper temperature limit for life (122°C) (34) and our heat conduction model. A shows a cross-sectional sketch of the IBM forearc. Fluid release from the subducting plate results in partial forearc mantle serpentinization. Tectonic activity causes mud-rock mixture to rise buoyantly in conduits along fault planes until it protrudes onto the seafloor to form massive serpentinite mud volcanoes (up to 50-km diameter and >2 km above the surrounding seafloor). The sketch in B displays a conceptual serpentinization evolution model and the depth range for possible subsurface microbial colonization. C and D show results of the one-dimensional heat conduction model (SI Estimation of the Maximum Depth for the Current Temperature Limit for Life), where C shows the maximum depth as a function of surface heat flow at constant thermal conductivity (partially serpentinized peridotite) below which microbial life is theoretically possible. D displays the influence of surface heat flow and thermal conductivity, at an average depth of 12,000 mbsf, on the upper temperature limit for life. mafic and ultramafic units and together with simultaneous serpentinization may be the source of fluids that can produce disequilibrium environments. An additional source of externally derived fluids could come directly from the subducting slab and would thus be in disequilibrium with the overriding forearc wedge. These fluids are most likely different in composition compared with serpentinizing systems at midocean ridges or passive margins. Kelemen and Manning (52) recently reevaluated the global carbon flux through subduction zones and estimated that several million tons of carbon per year could be released from subducting slabs into the overriding forearc wedge. Therefore, these fluids could provide the carbon source needed for abiotic hydrocarbon synthesis or even directly contribute organic molecules to the forearc and thus the serpentinite clasts. If the organic matter reported here was sourced from the subduction slab alone, we would expect the same level of maturation and thus evidence for the same functional groups. However, we observe the absence of specific Raman bands [N(C-C)] in clasts from different depths (Fig. 2F) . Various studies have shown that subduction zone dehydration reactions across a range of temperatures (200-600°C) and pressures release nitrogen that is able to enter the overriding forearc directly or travel with the expelled fluids upward through the subduction zone channel (53) (54) (55) . Moreover, recent thermodynamic calculations of the nitrogen speciation in aqueous fluids under upper mantle conditions suggest that the oxidized mantle wedge of subduction zones favors nitrogen over ammonium (NH 4 + ), promoting outgassing rather than mineral trapping of nitrogen (56) . Thus, the actions of mud volcanoes as conduits for slab-derived fluids may provide missing resources that would otherwise be limiting factors for life in the forearc mantle or contribute nitrogen to the abiogenic synthesis of more complex organic compounds. To rigorously evaluate the energy sources for microbial life within the subduction zone forearc, better constraints are needed for the fluid influxes from the subduction zone and how these slabderived fluids interact with the forearc. Increasing sophisticated fluid speciation models coupled to fluid-rock interaction simulations and experiments at high pressures and temperatures (56, 57) will provide critical insights into this problem. Although the origin of the organic matter cannot be unequivocally identified, we suggest, based on the similarities with molecular signatures of bacteria-derived biopolymers, that the organic matter may represent remnants of microbial life within or even below the mud volcanoes. Our simple model supports this hypothesis, showing that the temperature window for life could extend deep into the forearc. Hence, the identification of complex organic matter recovered from depths of up to 110.07 mbsf may be evidence for life in an oceanic serpentinite-hosted rock formation from depths likely far exceeding the drill core depth, where serpentinite-supported life has not yet been documented. Thus far, evidence for microbial communities within the Mariana mud volcanoes has only been indirectly detected in fluid samples no deeper than 20 mbsf (5, 24). There are a variety of examples indicating that microbial life can colonize shallow serpentinizationfueled environments and use abiogenically produced H 2 and CH 4 (1, (3) (4) (5) , but microbial life within the deep subsurface, for example, deep within the Mariana forearc, with no connection to the Earth's surface, may have little resemblance with presently known serpentinization-fueled ecosystems. In any case, if life is present in the subduction zone forearc, it has far-reaching implications as recent studies suggest that environments resembling those both within and below the Mariana serpentinite mud volcanoes were already present on the early Earth (58, 59) . Thus, even if modern-type subduction was not fully established in the Hadean and Archean, Mariana forearclike deep subsurface environments may have allowed early forms of life to thrive, despite violent phases such as the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of intensive meteorite bombardment around 3.9 Ga (60). Even if only a small amount of the global forearc mantle hosts microbial life, fluctuations in the total subduction zone length (61) could have significant consequences for the deep carbon budget. During these fluctuations, fluid flow through subduction zone forearc regions, visible in the form of serpentinite mud volcanism, are a crucial connection between the deep biosphere and surface world, influencing geochemical fluxes throughout Earth's history. Only if we keep exploring the windows into the deep subsurface, such as the serpentinite clasts presented here, will we be able to establish a full budget of Earth's deep carbon and the potential for a subsurface biosphere. Sample Preparation. Drilling during ODP Leg 195 was executed with the support of inorganic drilling mud (mainly sepiolite) and seawater. Immediately after the core was recovered, a 6-in. length of whole-round core was cut and refrigerated. Samples (diameter, 4.25 cm) were removed from the whole-round core using a piston core sampler. These subcores were loaded into a Manheim squeezer for the analysis of physical properties (62) . The applied axial pressure (6.3 MPa) under drained conditions is insufficient to cause pore collapse within individual clasts. From the ""squeeze cakes,"" 1/4 rounds were extracted for further onshore analysis and stored in a nonsterile fashion. Serpentinite clasts, hundreds of micrometers to a few millimeters in size, were extracted from these mud-pellets rounds by dissolution in distilled water and hand picking under a binocular microscope. Clasts were mounted in 1-in. round sections using epoxy resin and polished to expose the internal structures. The samples were not subjected to a vacuum impregnation step to avoid the penetration of epoxy into open spaces. For Raman spectroscopic details of the epoxy, see SI Raman Spectroscopy. To avoid laboratory contamination before microstructural and microchemical investigations, the samples were treated with 5% sodium hypochlorite and repolished using a diamond paste and concentrated ethanol to expose fresh sample surfaces. Subsequently, samples were again treated with 5% sodium hypochlorite. ToF-SIMS. Element distribution maps were obtained using an ION-TOF ToF-SIMS IV instrument at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC). The 25-kV 69Ga + primary ion column was operated in a low-current bunched mode with a cycle time of 45 μs, allowing for a mass resolution (full width half-maximum) of 4,600 at nominal mass 61 u (C 2 H 5 S) + . To remove surface contamination, an area four times larger than the analytical field of view was sputter-cleaned with a 3-keV Ar + ion beam before the actual measurement. FIB-SEM and Transmission Electron Microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations on Pt-coated specimens were carried out in a JEOL JCM-6000. A FEI Nova Nanolab FIB-SEM was used to acquire nanotomography volumes (voxel size, 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 nm) and to extract electron transparent foils for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FIB-SEM nanotomography was carried out at an acceleration voltage of 2 kV and a beam current of 0.21 nA. The nanotomography volumes were visualized and analyzed using Avizo 9. TEM investigations were executed in a FEI Tecnai 20F operated at 200 kV equipped with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector and an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy system. Raman Spectroscopy. Raman spectra of organic matter were collected using a near-infrared (784/785 nm) laser of a Horiba Scientific LabRam HR800 and a Kaiser HoloLab Series 5000. Hyperspectral Raman mapping of the organic matter distribution was executed with a lateral resolution of ∼1 μm and a spectral resolution of 2.3 cm −1 . Analysis of the ""fingerprinting"" serpentine OH bands was performed using a 532-nm laser of a WITec alpha 300R. Further information about instrument settings and Raman spectra analysis is found in SI Raman Spectroscopy.",Oliver Plümper,2017,28396389,10.1073/pnas.1612147114

206723511,Archaeal Populations in Hypersaline Sediments Underlying Orange Microbial Mats in the Napoli Mud Volcano,"Microbial mats in marine cold seeps are known to be associated with ascending sulfide- and methane-rich fluids. Hence, they could be visible indicators of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and methane cycling processes in underlying sediments. The Napoli mud volcano is situated in the Olimpi Area that lies on saline deposits; from there, brine fluids migrate upward to the seafloor. Sediments associated with a brine pool and microbial orange mats of the Napoli mud volcano were recovered during the Medeco cruise. Based on analysis of RNA-derived sequences, the ""active"" archaeal community was composed of many uncultured lineages, such as rice cluster V or marine benthic group D. Function methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) genes were affiliated with the anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea (ANME) of the ANME-1, ANME-2a, and ANME-2c groups, suggesting that AOM occurred in these sediment layers. Enrichment cultures showed the presence of viable marine methylotrophic Methanococcoides in shallow sediment layers. Thus, the archaeal community diversity seems to show that active methane cycling took place in the hypersaline microbial mat-associated sediments of the Napoli mud volcano.","Over 200 mud volcanoes have been found along the northern flank of the Mediterranean Ridge in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (13). The formation of the Mediterranean Ridge is linked to the collisional tectonics between the African and Eurasian plates, resulting in intensive faulting (19) . Within the Mediterranean Ridge, the Olimpi area, situated south of Crete, is a dynamic environment containing active seepage of mud, fluid, and brines.

A 194 denaturing gradient gel consists of [100% denaturant equals 7M urea and 40% (v/v) 195 formamide]. Gels were poured with the aid of a 30 mL volume Gradient Mixer (Hoefer 196 SG30, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and prepared with 1 X TAE buffer (MP 197 Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). Electrophoresis was carried out at 60°C, 200 V for 5 198 hours (with an initial electrophoresis for 10 min at 80 V) in 1 X TAE buffer. 199 Polyacrylamide gels were stained with SYBRGold nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen, 200 San Diega, CA) for 30 min, and viewed using the Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode 201 Imager (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The reverse transcription reaction mix was incubated at 42°C for 2 min. A 200-unit 213 aliquot of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase was added prior to a 80 min incubation at 214 42°C for the reverse transcription of the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA). The 215 reaction was then stopped by heating at 70°C for 15 minutes. The cDNA end product 216 was used as a template for archaeal 16S rRNA gene based PCR using the primerset 340F/915R. The PCR amplification involved 20 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 71°C to 218 61°C (touchdown -1°C per cycle) for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were 219 purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) The mcrA genes were amplified using the ME1 (5'-GCMATGCARATHGGWATGTC-230 3') and ME2 (5'-TCATKGCRTAGTTDGGRTAGT-3') primers (20). The PCR 231 conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 40 s, annealing at 50°C for 1'30 232 min, and extension at 72°C for 3 min, for 30 cycles.

The chloride porewater profile showed an 286 increase in concentration with depth ( Fig. 2) , reaching 1200 mM at 10 cmbsf, which 287 is more than 2 times higher than normal seawater concentrations (600 mM, (13)). 288 The sodium concentrations showed a similar increase with depth (Supplementary 289 material. SM1), reaching 1224 mM at 10 cmbsf, which is also more than 2 times 290 higher than normal seawater concentrations (492 mM, (13) by the orange-pigmented mat bacteria showed chloride concentrations of 700 mM, 295 and could be influenced by the brine pools contiguous to the filamentous bacteria on 296 the seafloor. Moreover, bacterial mats are a common feature found in habitats 297 influenced by hypersaline brine fluid intrusions (43, 48) . 298 The sulfate porewater concentrations showed a slight decrease with depth ( Fig. 2) , 299 which could suggest sulfate reduction. Sediments associated with orange-and white-300 pigmented Beggiatoa mats have been shown to host high rates of sulfate reduction, 301 probably a combination of increased substrate availability in the seep fluids, and of 302 rapid sulfate recycling within the sulfur-oxidizing bacterial mat (43, 48 The DGGE fingerprints (Fig. 3A ) generated from DNA samples extracted from 314 sediment layers associated with orange-pigmented microbial mats of the Napoli mud 315 volcano displayed a complex and diverse distribution of the archaeal communities. 316 The resulting dendrogram (Fig. 3B ) of the DGGE pattern highlighted clear changes in 317 populations with depth in two separate clusters. The first cluster grouped depths 0 to 318 4 cmbsf, and the second the 4 to 10 cmbsf sediment layers, suggesting a change in 319 archaeal populations at 4 cmbsf, with increasing depth and salinity. This shift could 320 be linked to the presence of the bacterial filaments in these sediments. Indeed these 321 filaments belonging to what is commonly called ""Big Bacteria"" could have locally 322 modified the geochemical conditions in the surrounding sediments (56), therefore 323 affecting the microbial community diversity in the upper 4 cm. Salt concentrations 324 might also have affected the depth distribution of the microbial communities, as 325 reported elsewhere (28) . 326 According to the statistical analysis of the DGGE pattern indicating a shift in the 327 archaeal community at 4 cmbsf, we constructed two RNA-derived 16S rRNA gene 328 libraries for depths 0-4, and 6-10 cmbsf. A total of 55 archaeal RNA-derived 16S 329 rRNA gene sequences were analysed for the 0-4 cmbsf section, and 72 for the 6-10 330 cmbsf section. Rarefaction curves generated for the RNA-derived 16S rRNA genes 331 indicated saturation (Supplementary material. SM2), while percent coverage was 332 determined to be 40% and 72.2% for the 0-4 and 6-10 cmbsf sections respectively. 333 Hence coverage analysis suggests that the full diversity of archaeal 16S rRNA 334 sequences was not exhausted and that a greater diversity remains to be detected 335 within these sediments. Simpson's diversity indices (57) were calculated for each 336 section, and indicated a decrease in archaeal diversity with depth (D=0.9554 for the 337 0-4 cmbsf section, and 0.9109 for the 6-10 cmbsf section). 338 The phylogenetic trees of the RNA-derived 16S rRNA gene libraries showed high 339 archaeal diversity and a majority of sequences most closely related to environmental 340 clones from mud volcano sediments of the Mediterranean Sea (i.e. Milano, Kazan, 341 Chefren), marine sediments and subseafloor sediments (i.e. Peru margin). Thirtyeight OTUs belonging to archaeal uncultured groups were dected in the 0-4 cmbsf 343 sediment layer 16S gene library, belonging to two major groups (Fig. 4 and 5) : 344 Marine Benthic Group D (MBG-D, 40.5%) and Rice Cluster V (RC-V, 40.5%). The 345 other minor groups that were detected also belong to uncultured archaeal lineages 346 (Fig. 4 and 5 to uncultured archaeal groups were detected as well (Fig. 4 and 5) , i.e. TMEG, 356 Marine Benthic Group E (MBG-E), and MBG-B. Two clones were affiliated with the 357 methanogenic order Methanosarcinales, one with the anaerobic methanotrophic 358 group ANME-3, one with the Rice Cluster II, which are surmised to be involved in 359 methane production (18), and finally one clone (NapMat-6_10-rtH01) was affiliated 360 with an extreme halophilic Archaea of the Halobacteria (47). Most of the sequences 361 only detected in the 6-10 cmbsf section (i.e. MBG-B, MCG, and TMEG) were closely 362 related with sequences retrived from subsurface sediments of the Peru margin (7, 363 60) . 364 Intriguingly, RC-V members were presumably active in the 0-4 cmbsf sediments 365 underlying orange-pigmented mats. The RC-V were first discovered in an anoxic 366 flooded rice paddy soil (18), detected in many freshwater sediments (12, 17, 67, 68) ,and were recently shown to be active in tubeworm populated sediments of the 368 Storegga Slide (34). The intralineage levels of rDNA similarity of the RC-V 369 sequences were low highlighting that this group seems to be phylogenetically very 370 diverse. This could suggest diverse metabolic activities and physiologies. RC-V were 371 also previously observed in cold coastal waters of the Mackenzie River in 372 northwestern Canada, rich in suspended particles (16). The authors suggested that 373 RC-V were linked to detrital decomposition. The Napoli sediments in which the RC-V 374 were detected had a high organic matter content (data not shown), which could 375 support the hypothesis of an organotrophic metabolism. This study is the first to 376 report occurrence of probable active members of the RC-V in hypersaline sediments. 377 Also, sequences affiliated with the RC-V were not detected in the 6-10 cmbsf 378 sediment layers where salinity reached 1300 mM, suggesting that members of the 379 RC-V probably do not tolerate high salt concentrations. mcrA group a/b (ANME-1 as defined by Hallam et al, (22) ), mcrA group c/d (ANME-402 2c) and mcrA group e (ANME-2a). The majority of the mcrA clones were related to 403 the ANME-2a at 2-4 cmbsf (58.3%), followed by the ANME-1. The ANME-2c 404 sequences represented only a small portion of the ANME in the gene library. At the 405 8-10 cmbsf section, the ANME-1 became the dominant group (65.6%), followed by 406 the ANME-2c, and the ANME-2a represented only a small proportion of the ANME in 407 the gene library. 408 Sediments underlying bacterial mats seem to constitute hot spots for AOM (43) (52), and in sediments covered with 414 white-pigmented mats of the Gulf of Mexico (43). It has been suggested that ANME-2 415 may be more active at low temperatures compared to ANME-1 (44). Temperature 416 gradient measurements of the active center of the Napoli mud volcano showed littleincrease of temperature with depth down to 160 cmbsf, with an average temperature 418 of 14°C (Lazar et al., unpublished data) . It has also been suggested that ANME-2 419 dominate sediment layers with high sulfate concentrations whereas ANME-1 seem to 420 be found in sediment layers with low sulfate concentrations (31). Therefore, the 421 distribution of the ANME-2 in the Napoli mud volcano sediments could support these 422 assessments (Fig. 7) . 423 ANME-1 Archaea have been detected in various environments. In hypersaline 424 sediments of the Gulf of Mexico, the community of ANME was found to be limited to 425 the ANME-1b, which were probably active (36). The authors suggested that the 426 ANME-1b preponderance could be explained by the high salinity of the site (chloride 427 concentration was 2200 mM), and that ANME-1b could be a high salinity adapted 428 subpopulation.

9590844,"Geochemistry of high arsenic groundwater in Chia-Nan plain, Southwestern Taiwan: Possible sources and reactive transport of arsenic","Abstract Major ion, trace element, and stable isotope analyses were performed on groundwater samples collected during November 2005 and 2006 in Chia-Nan plain of southwestern Taiwan to examine As mobilization in aquifers. The high concentrations of As, Fe and Mn in the groundwater is consistent with low Eh values (under moderately reduced state). Moreover, the observed Na/Cl and SO 4 /Cl molar ratios in groundwater demonstrate the influence of seawater intrusion. Seawater intrusion could provide required electron acceptors (i.e., SO 4 ) for bacterial sulfate reduction and promote reducing conditions that are favorable for As mobilization. The concurrent increases in the concentrations of Fe and Mn from 2005 to 2006 may be caused by bacterial Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction. Geochemical modeling demonstrate that As(III) is the dominant As species and the presence of Fe-bearing carbonates, sulfides, and oxide phases may locally act as potential sinks for As. Mud volcano fluids were also collected and analyzed to assess the possible source of As in the Chia-Nan plain groundwater. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic signatures indicate that the As-rich mud volcano fluids may have been modified by chemical exchange with 18 O-rich crustal rocks and possibly originated from mixing of deep brines with circulating meteoric water. Thus As in the Chia-Nan plain groundwater may have been evolved from deep crustal fluids or rock sources. The hydrogeochemistry and widespread As enrichment in groundwater of Chia-Nan plain result from multiple processes, e.g., de-watering of deep crustal fluids, seawater intrusion, and biogeochemical cycling of Fe, As, and S in alluvial sediments.",N/A,Bibhash Nath,2008,18572272,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.04.005
6153701,Viral infections stimulate the metabolism and shape prokaryotic assemblages in submarine mud volcanoes,"Mud volcanoes are geological structures in the oceans that have key roles in the functioning of the global ecosystem. Information on the dynamics of benthic viruses and their interactions with prokaryotes in mud volcano ecosystems is still completely lacking. We investigated the impact of viral infection on the mortality and assemblage structure of benthic prokaryotes of five mud volcanoes in the Mediterranean Sea. Mud volcano sediments promote high rates of viral production (1.65-7.89 × 10(9) viruses g(-1) d(-1)), viral-induced prokaryotic mortality (VIPM) (33% cells killed per day) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production (3.0-8.3 μgC g(-1) d(-1)) when compared with sediments outside the mud volcano area. The viral shunt (that is, the microbial biomass converted into dissolved organic matter as a result of viral infection, and thus diverted away from higher trophic levels) provides 49 mgC m(-2) d(-1), thus fuelling the metabolism of uninfected prokaryotes and contributing to the total C budget. Bacteria are the dominant components of prokaryotic assemblages in surface sediments of mud volcanoes, whereas archaea dominate the subsurface sediment layers. Multivariate multiple regression analyses show that prokaryotic assemblage composition is not only dependant on the geochemical features and processes of mud volcano ecosystems but also on synergistic interactions between bottom-up (that is, trophic resources) and top-down (that is, VIPM) controlling factors. Overall, these findings highlight the significant role of the viral shunt in sustaining the metabolism of prokaryotes and shaping their assemblage structure in mud volcano sediments, and they provide new clues for our understanding of the functioning of cold-seep ecosystems.","Submarine mud volcanoes are geological structures that are formed by the eruption of mud, fluids and gases (typically methane) from deep-subsurface sediment reservoirs (Milkov, 2000) . Global estimates suggest that 10 3 -10 5 mud volcanoes are distributed worldwide, mostly concentrated on the continental margins and abyssal plains (Dimitrov, 2002) . Mud volcanoes are expected to have key roles in the carbon budget, biogeochemical cycles, climate regulation, biomass production and maintenance of biodiversity, thus providing essential 'goods and services' for global ecosystems (Niemann et al., 2006; Jørgensen and Boetius, 2007) . The emission of methane and other hydrocarbons, the presence of gas hydrates, and the release of high concentrations of sulphides sustain an enormous microbial biomass (Pimenov et al., 1997; Boetius and Suess, 2004; Joye et al., 2004) . At present, we know that microbial assemblages in cold-seep ecosystems are typically dominated by sulphatereducing bacteria and methanotrophic archaea, which mediate anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulphate (Jørgensen and Boetius, 2007) . This process represents one of the major global sinks for methane (Michaelis et al., 2002; Niemann et al., 2006; Pachiadaki et al., 2010) . Although viruses dominate all of the ecosystems on the Earth numerically (outnumbering prokaryotes by about 10-fold; Suttle, 2005; Danovaro et al., 2008a ) and they are a major cause of mortality for a wide range of marine organisms (Fuhrman, 1999; Suttle, 2005) , their role in ecosystems characterised by seepage is still unclear. Information available from both shallow-water hydrothermal vents (Mediterranean Sea and Pacific Oceans; Manini et al., 2008) and cold seeps (Sagamy Bay, Japan, and Gulf of Mexico; Middelboe et al., 2006; Kellogg, 2010; respectively) suggests that these environments can be either 'hot-spots' or 'cold-spots' of viral activity (that is, enhanced or reduced viral activity at seep sites, as compared with surrounding sediments). However, information on the dynamics of benthic viruses and their interactions with prokaryotes in mud volcano ecosystems is still completely lacking. Recent studies carried out in marine sediments worldwide have indicated that the viral shunt, which was originally described for pelagic systems (Wilhelm and Suttle, 1999) , is also an essential source of organic detritus in benthic ecosystems. Here, viral lysis of the infected microbes transforms the cell contents and biomass into organic detritus, which contribute greatly to the metabolism of noninfected prokaryotes (Danovaro et al., 2008b) . Here, we report the results of the first investigation conducted on viral production and decay, viral impact on prokaryotic mortality, and the contribution of the viral shunt to C cycling in five mud volcanoes of the Mediterranean Sea. We also explore the role of viral infection in controlling prokaryotic assemblage structure in these ecosystems. Study site and sampling strategy Sediment samples were collected in the Sicily Channel (Western Mediterranean; Figure 1 ) from February to July, 2007. The region under investigation has about 175 mud volcanoes and a venting area of about 0.1 km 2 (Holland et al., 2003) . The sampling strategy included a set of seven sampling areas, five of which were located in mud volcanoes (MV02, MV03, MV04, MV05 and MV06), with two areas located along the slope at similar depths and without gas emissions (hereafter defined as the controls: CTRL1 and CTRL2; Figure 1 ). The geophysical survey led to the defining of two main geomorphological structures: (i) terrace-like carbonate structures (hereafter referred to as ridges), which consist of large tabular sub-elongated structures that are elevated up to 5 m to 10 m from the sea floor, and which have flat tops that are surmounted by several carbonate structures; and (ii) domeshaped structures that are isolated or in clusters and are 50 m to 200 m wide and up to 5 m high. A detailed description of mud volcano areas was reported by Savini et al. (2009) . Seawater samples were collected within 5 m of the seabed at the MV04, MV05 and MV06 stations, using Niskin bottles. The gas (methane) dissolved in these samples was analysed by gas chromatography (Carle AGC 100-400 TCD-FID GC) at Isotech Labs Inc. (Champaign, IL, USA). At each site, three undisturbed sediment cores were collected using a NIOZ-type box-corer, which allows collection of samples that can be hermetically closed. Immediately after sampling, sediment sub-aliquots were collected for analysis of the biochemical composition of the organic matter and for microbiological parameters. For analyses of the biochemical composition of the organic matter in the sediments (in terms of protein, carbohydrate, lipid and total phytopigment), the samples were stored at À20 1C. To provide accurate estimates of viral abundance, production and decay, the surface (0-1 cm) and subsurface (10-15 cm) layers from each sediment core were immediately processed onboard, without the addition of any preservative (Danovaro et al., 2001; Dell'Anno et al., 2009) . This was because it is widely recognised that the use of formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde for sample storage can result in a rapid loss of viruses in sediment samples (Helton et al., 2006; Dell'Anno et al., 2009) . For the prokaryotic counts, samples from these surface (0-1 cm) and sub-surface (10-15 cm) layers of each sediment core were fixed with buffered 2% formalin and stored at 4 1C until processed (within two weeks; Danovaro et al., 2002) . For analysis of prokaryotic heterotrophic C production, additional subsamples from the top first 1 cm were processed immediately after retrieval, as described below. For analysis of the prokaryotic assemblage structure by catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (CARD-FISH), the surface (top 1 cm) and subsurface (10-15 cm layer) sediment aliquots of each core were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (polymerised formaldehyde, dry chemical), washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4, pH 7.6), and then stored in phosphate-buffered saline solution: 96% ethanol (1:1) at À20 1C until further processing . The concentrations of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids in the sediment were determined spectrophotometrically, according to Danovaro (2010) , and expressed as bovine serum albumin, glucose and tripalmitine equivalents, respectively. The sum of the carbohydrate, protein and lipid concentrations converted into carbon equivalents (using the conversion factors of 0.40, 0.49 and 0.75 mg C mg À1 , respectively) was defined as the biopolymeric organic carbon ). Chlorophyll-a and phaeopigment concentrations were determined fluorometrically, according to Danovaro (2010) . Total phytopigments were defined as the sum of chlorophyll-a and phaeopigments, and their concentrations are reported as mg g À1 . Details of the analyses of the biochemical composition of the organic matter are reported in the Supplementary Materials. Viral counting was carried out as described by Danovaro et al. (2001) . Sediment sub-samples (0.5 cm 3 of wet sediment) were diluted in an equal volume of virus-free seawater (filtered at 0.02 mm pore size using disposable syringe filters; Anotop 25, Whatman; dilution 1:1, v:v), and treated with pyrophosphate (final concentration, 5 mM) and ultrasound (three times, for 1 min each; Branson 2200 sonicator, 60 W) to increase the extraction yields. The samples were then diluted 100-500-fold in virus-free water and filtered onto 0.02 mm pore size filters (Anodisc Al 2 O 3 ; 25 mm diameter, Whatman). Then the filters were stained using SYBR Green I (10 000 Â in anhydrous dimethyl sulphoxide; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA), incubated in the dark for 20 min, and then mounted on glass slides with a drop of 50% phosphate buffer (6.7 mM, pH 7.8) and 50% glycerol containing 0.5% ascorbic acid (Noble and Fuhrman, 1998) . Viral counting was performed under epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2; magnification, Â 1000; filter set #9, excitation BP 450-490, beam splitter FT 515, emission LP 520), by examining at least 10 fields per slide, and counting at least 400 viral particles per filter. The viral abundance was expressed as viruses per g dry sediment (after desiccation at 60 1C for 24 h). For prokaryotic counting, ca. 1 cm 3 of sediment from the top 1 cm and from the 10-15 cm layer of each sediment core were analysed as previously described by Danovaro et al. (2002) . Three replicate sediment sub-samples were each suspended in tetrasodium pyrophosphate (final concentration, 5 mM) and sonicated three times (Branson Sonifier 2200; 60 W for 1 min). The samples were then diluted with sterile seawater that was pre-filtered through 0.2-mm-pore-size filters (25 mm diameter disposable syringe filters; Whatman). Following filtering onto 0.2 mm pore size filters (Anodisc Al 2 O 3 , 25 mm diameter; Whatman), the samples were stained using SYBR Green I (10 000 Â concentrate in anhydrous dimethyl sulphoxide; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen), and the filters were incubated in the dark for 20 min and mounted on microscope slides with 20 ml 50% phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and 50% glycerol containing 0.5% ascorbic acid. Total prokaryotic counts were obtained under epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2, magnification Â 1000, filter set #9, excitation BP 450-490, beam splitter FT 515, emission LP 520) by examining at least 10 fields per slide, to count at least 200 cells per filter. The data were normalised to sediment dry weight after desiccation (60 1C, 24 h). Viral production and decay Viral production in the sediments was determined as described by Dell'Anno et al. (2009) . Three replicate sediment samples of about 25 ml were transferred into sterile tubes and mixed with 25 ml Viral infections in submarine mud volcanoes C Corinaldesi et al virus-free seawater. Subsamples (0.5 ml) were collected for viral counts at 0, 1.5, 3, 6 and 12 h. As the increases in viral abundance were not linear over the first 12 h of incubation, in all of the samples, the net viral production was determined as the maximum increment of viral abundance per g dry sediment per h. Viral decay was defined as the rate of disappearance of free viruses (Danovaro et al., 2008a) , and this was determined following the same procedure used for the analysis of viral production, by monitoring the decrease of viruses over time according to Corinaldesi et al. (2010) . Sediment subsamples (1:1, sediment:virus-free seawater) were collected at 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. The measurements of viral decay were started only when a significant decrease in the viral abundance was evident, that is, generally 6-12 h after the beginning of the experiment. Viral decay rates were estimated as the maximum rate of decrease of the viral abundance during the timecourse experiments. The viral decay rate was expressed as the number of viruses per g dry sediment per h. Gross viral production was estimated as the sum of the net viral production and decay rates. Prokaryotic heterotrophic production Prokaryotic heterotrophic production was measured using [ 3 H]-leucine incorporation, following the procedure previously described by Danovaro et al. (2002) . Sediment sub-samples (200 ml) were supplemented with an aqueous solution of [ 3 H]-leucine (0.2 nmol final concentration, specific activity, 72 Ci mmol À1 ), and incubated for 1 h in the dark at the in situ temperature. Three sediment blanks were run in parallel, adding ethanol immediately before the [ 3 H]-leucine addition. After the incubation, the samples were supplemented with ethanol (80%) and stored at 4 1C until they were processed in the laboratory. Briefly, the sediments were washed two times with ethanol (80%) by mixing, centrifuging at 14 000 g for 5 min, and discarding the supernatant. The sediment was then re-suspended in 80% ethanol and transferred onto a polycarbonate membrane filter (0.2 mm pore size, Nucleopore, 25 mm diameter) using a filtration apparatus and a vaccum pump (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, o100 mm Hg). Subsequently, each filter was washed four times with 2 ml 5% trichloroacetic acid, and then each filter was transferred into a pyrex test-tube containing 2 ml 2 M NaOH and heated to 100 1C for 2 h. After centrifugation at 800 g to separate the sediment residue, 1 ml supernatant was transferred to scintillation vials containing an appropriate scintillation fluid. The incorporated radioactivity (as disintegration per minute) in the sediment samples was measured by determining the counts per minute in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 300). The data were normalised to sediment dry weight after desiccation (60 1C, 24 h). Prokaryotic burst size (the number of viruses released by cell lysis due to viral infection) was calculated as the ratio of viral production to cells killed (Danovaro et al., 2008b) . The number of prokaryotes killed by the viruses was estimated by time-course experiments on the basis of the expected number of prokaryotes produced (calculated as prokaryotic turnover multiplied by prokaryotic abundance) and the number of prokaryotes actually counted over the same time interval (Corinaldesi et al., 2007) . VIPM was calculated as follows: where: KP is the number of prokaryotes killed by the viruses per g sediment per h, and TP is the total prokaryotic abundance per g sediment. Catalysed reporter deposition-fluorescence in-situ hybridisation The analysis of the benthic prokaryotic assemblage structure at the domain level (Bacteria vs Archaea) as performed by CARD-FISH, as previously described (Teira et al., 2004; Schippers et al., 2005; Danovaro et al., 2009) . Methodological details are reported in the Supplementary Materials. To test for differences in all of the variables investigated between the sampling sites, one-way analysis of variance was applied using the GMAV 5.0. software (University of Sidney, Australia), after testing for the homogeneity of variances using the Cochran test. When significant differences were encountered, Tukey's post-hoc comparison tests (at a ¼ 0.05) were also carried out, to determine in which station(s) the parameters investigated were significantly different. Multivariate multiple regression analysis was also used for investigation of the biotic and abiotic factors that influence viral distribution and prokaryotic assemblage composition. All of the analyses were carried out with routine distance-based multivariate analysis for a linear model forward (Anderson, 2004) . The P-values were obtained using 4999 permutations of residuals under the reduced model (Anderson, 2001) . Methane concentrations and biochemical composition of organic matter The methane, biopolymeric C, and phytopigment concentrations are reported in Table 1 . Both the domes and ridges are influenced by methane seeps, with the highest concentrations of methane dissolved in the seawater at the MV05 station. Biopolymeric C concentrations (used as a proxy for the available trophic resources; Pusceddu et al., 2009) in the surface sediments ranged from 0.27 ± 0.04 to 3.25 ± 1.15 mgC g À1 (at stations MV06 and CTRL2, respectively), while the total phytopigment concentrations varied from 3.8±0.8 mg g À1 to 33.4 ± 10.5 mg g À1 (at stations CTRL2 and MV02, respectively). Viral abundance in the surface sediments (0-1 cm layer) ranged from 5.42 ± 1.53Â10 8 to 31.87 ± 1.24Â10 8 viruses g À1 (at stations CTRL1 and MV05, respectively; Figure 2a ), and it was significantly higher in the mud volcanoes than in the control stations (analysis of variance, Po0.01). At all of the stations, the viral abundance decreased significantly in the subsurface sediment layers (range, 3.63±0.61 Â 10 8 to 9.85± 1.28 Â 10 8 viruses g , at the 10-15 cm sediment depth at stations MV06 and MV02, respectively, Po0.05, Figure 2a ). Prokaryotic abundance in the surface sediments (0-1 cm layer; Figure 2b ) ranged from 1.89 ± 0.30 Â 10 8 cells g À1 to 11.31±2.01 Â 10 8 cells g À1 (at stations CTRL1 and MV02, respectively), and on average, it was significantly higher for the mud volcanoes than for the control stations (7.37 Â 10 8 vs 3.02 Â 10 8 cells g À1 , Po0.01). In the subsurface sediments (10-15 cm layer), the prokaryotic abundance (range, 0.60 ± 0.14-5.22 ± 0.65 Â 10 8 cell g À1 at stations MV06 and MV02, respectively) was significantly lower than in the surface sediments (Po0.05). The virus to prokaryote abundance ratio ranged from 1.6 to 7.9 in the surface sediments (at stations MV02 and MV05, respectively), and from 1.9 to 10.6 in the subsurface sediments (at stations MV02 and MV05, respectively; Figure 2c ). The net viral production in the surface sediments ranged from 0.25±0.02 Â 10 8 to 3.29±0.43 Â 10 8 virus g À1 h À1 (at stations CTRL1 and MV03, respectively). Significant differences were observed among the stations, with viral production higher in the mud volcano sediments than in the control sediments (Po0.05; Figure 3a) . Viral decay ranged from 0.37 ± 0.09 Â 10 7 to 8.83 ± 2.91 Â 10 7 viruses g À1 h À1 (at stations CTRL1 and MV04, respectively; Figure 3b ). The mud volcano sediments were characterised by viral decay rates (on average, 5.25 Â 10 7 viruses g À1 h À1 ) that were significantly higher than in the control sediments (on average, 0.87 Â 10 7 viruses g À1 h À1 ; Po0.01). Viral decay accounted for 22% of the gross production in the mud volcano sediments, and 25% in the control sediments. VIPM in the mud volcano stations, except for MV02, was significantly higher than in the control stations (Po0.01; on average, 33% vs 23% killed prokaryotes per day in mud volcano and control sediments, respectively; Figure 3c ). Prokaryotic heterotrophic C production in surface sediments ranged from 43.0±12.4 to 346.6± 54.9 ngC g À1 h À1 (at stations CTRL1 and MV03, respectively) and was ca. 6-fold higher in the mud volcano sediments than in the control sediments (Figure 4a ). The prokaryotic biomass in the surface sediments ranged from 4.5 ± 0.7 to 33.5 ± 8.6 mgC g À1 (at stations CTRL1 and MV02, respectively), and on average, for the mud volcanoes it was ca. three-fold higher than in the control sediments (21.6 vs 6.5 mgC g  The number of benthic prokaryotes detected using CARD-FISH (that is, the total bacterial abundance plus the total archaeal abundance) accounted for, on average, 73% of the total prokaryotic abundance as determined using SYBR Green I.  The abundance of bacteria and archaea was significantly higher in the surface sediments of the mud volcanoes than in the control sediments (on average, 4.65 Â 10 8 vs 1.16 Â 10 8 cells g À1 for bacteria, and 1.13 Â 10 8 vs 0.54 Â 10 8 cells g À1 for archaea; Po0.01; Figure 5a ). The abundance of Archaea increased with the depth of the sediment, and was ca. double the abundance of bacteria (on average, 6.37 Â 10 7 vs 3.38 Â 10 7 cells g À1 , respectively; Figure 5b ). Within the archaeal domain, the contributions of crenarchaea and euryarchaea were similar in surface sediments of mud volcanoes (on average, ca. 10% of the total cell counts by CARD-FISH; see Supplementary Figure S2a) . Conversely, the abundance of crenarchaea was ca. three-fold higher than that of euryarchaea in the control sediments (on average, 23.3% vs 8.3%). Crenarchaea accounted for a significantly lower fraction than for euryarchaea in the subsurface sediments of the mud volcanoes (on average, 3.3% vs 32.1%; Figure S2b ). The impact of viruses on prokaryotic activity Viral abundance in mud volcano sediments was significantly higher than that determined in the control sediments, with values similar to that previously reported in cold seeps of the Gulf of Mexico (Kellogg, 2010) , although much higher than that observed in a cold seep of Sagami Bay (Japan, Middelboe et al., 2006) . The determination of viral and prokaryotic abundance alone does not provide information on the dynamics of benthic viruses and their effects on prokaryotic assemblages (Danovaro et al., 2008b) . We thus also investigated viral production, decay and impact on prokaryotes. Viral production in the mud volcano sediments was high and comparable to values reported for highly productive benthic coastal ecosystems (Danovaro et al., 2008a) . In addition, viral production in the mud volcanoes investigated was significantly higher (up to one order of magnitude) than that of the control sediments. Recent studies have indicated that lysogenic infection can prevail on the lytic strategy both in shallow and deep hydrothermal vent ecosystems (Williamson et al., 2008; Maugeri et al., 2010) . However, our results suggest that the environmental conditions of mud volcanoes promote high rates of viral replication through lytic infection, which indicates that these ecosystems represent hot spots of viral activity. Viral production co-varied with the metabolic activity of the prokaryotes (prokaryotic C production: n ¼ 15, r ¼ 0.89, Po0.01), which was, on average, ca. six-fold higher in the mud volcano sediments than in the control sediments. The high heterotrophic prokaryotic C production in mud volcano sediments was associated with high concentrations of organic C derived from primary production processes (that is, the phytopigment content was ca. six-fold higher than in the control sediments). The viral impact on prokaryotes in the mud volcano sediments was, on average, higher than in the control sediments (33% and 23% of prokaryotes killed per day, respectively), and was even higher when compared with prokaryotic mortality previously reported for marine sediments at similar depths worldwide (Danovaro et al., 2008b) . This suggests that viral infection has crucial implications in the functioning of mud volcano ecosystems. We also found that viral and prokaryotic abundance in subsurface sediments (the 10-15 cm layer) was significantly lower than in the surface sediments (the 0-1 cm layer). However, viral abundance decreased with depth in the sediment to a lesser extent than prokaryotic abundance. Consequently, the virus-to-prokaryote abundance ratios in the subsurface sediments were up to 3-fold higher than in surface sediments. This pattern allows us to hypothesise that the viral impact on their hosts in these subsurface sediments is even greater than in the surface sediments (Corinaldesi et al., 2010) . Overall, these findings suggest that the environmental conditions in mud volcanoes sustain high prokaryotic heterotrophic metabolism, and promote highly dynamic virus-prokaryote interactions. Factors influencing the viral shunt in mud volcano sediments Viral abundance in marine sediments is generally related to viral production (Danovaro et al., 2008a) , Figure 5 Abundances of bacteria and archaea in surface (a) and subsurface sediments (b). nd, not determined. C Corinaldesi et al although this was not the case for the present study, as the patterns of viral abundance in the mud volcano sediments were opposite to those of the viral production. In particular, the highest viral abundance and the lowest viral production rates were observed in the mud volcano sediments that were characterised by the highest gas emission (MV05, viral abundance one third of that in the other mud volcano stations). The uncoupled patterns between viral abundance and production can be dependant upon viral decay rates (Corinaldesi et al., 2010) . Indeed, at the MV05 station, we found the lowest viral decay rate and contribution to the gross viral production (12%). Statistical multivariate analyses reveal also that ca. 95% of the total variance of the viral abundance was explained by the biopolymeric carbon and methane concentrations, which can influence the viral distribution by stimulation of the metabolism of their host and/or by supplying mud volcano sediments with viruses not produced in situ. We conclude here that the main factors driving the highly dynamic viral assemblages in mud volcanoes are different and more complex than those in sediments without seepage. The viral shunt fuels the metabolism of benthic prokaryotes and influences their assemblage structure Viral lysis of prokaryotic cells results in the release of cellular detritus, which can be an important organic source for prokaryotic metabolism (Corinaldesi et al., 2007; Suttle, 2007; Danovaro et al., 2008a, b) . In mud volcano sediments, we estimated that the C released by viral lysis was, on average, 47 mg C m À2 d À1 . This is ca. four-fold higher than that released in the control sediments, which in turn is similar to values reported for other benthic systems at similar depths worldwide (Danovaro et al., 2008a, b) . If we also include the organic C released by viral decay in the C flux derived from viral-shunt processes, the amount of C derived by viral lysis in the mud volcano sediments was, on average, 49 mg C m À2 d À1 . Assuming a conservative value of C conversion efficiency in prokaryotic biomass of 20% (del Giorgio and Cole, 1998), the amount of C released by viral lysis accounts for ca. 21% of the prokaryotic C demand in the mud volcano sediments. Such values are comparable to those previously reported in different marine pelagic systems (5-30% of the prokaryotic carbon demand; Wilhelm and Suttle, 1999; Bonilla-Findji et al., 2008) . Recent studies have suggested that viral lysis of microorganisms is also a source of recalcitrantdissolved organic carbon, and as this is resistant to microbial degradation, it can persist in the ocean interior for thousands of years (Jiao et al., 2010) . Overall, these findings suggest that the total C released by viral lysis in mud volcano sediments can sustain prokaryotic assemblages through stimulation of the metabolism of non-infected prokaryotes, and it can represent a carbon source that fuels the dissolved organic carbon pool of the overlying water column. Information on the impact of viral infection on prokaryotic biodiversity and community structure in benthic ecosystems is still largely lacking (Hewson and Fuhrman, 2007) . In the present study, we found that bacteria are the dominant component of prokaryotic assemblages both in surface sediments of mud volcanoes and in the controls. Conversely, in the subsurface sediments of mud volcanoes, archaea account for ca. 60% of prokaryotic abundance, on average. The increase in the relative importance of archaea with increasing depth in sediments has already been reported for continental margins (Biddle et al., 2006; Lipp et al., 2008) and other mud volcano ecosystems (Lö sekann et al., 2007) , which suggests that this component is more adapted than bacteria to live and grow under the environmental conditions occurring in the mud volcano subsurface. Previous studies have suggested that crenarchaea typically dominate over euryarchaea in oxygenated deep waters (De Long et al., 1999; Karner et al., 2001 ) and surface sediments (Vetriani et al., 1999; Danovaro et al., 2009) . We found the same pattern in the control sediments, whereas euryarchaea were dominant in the surface and subsurface sediments of the mud volcanoes. The dominance of euryarchaea over crenarchaea has been previously reported for gas-hydrate-bearing and methane-bearing sediments, and this was related to the exploitation of the methane released by the seeps (Inagaki et al., 2006; Parkes et al., 2007; Pachiadaki et al., 2010) . To determine which factors mainly influence the composition of prokaryotic assemblages in mud volcano sediments, we carried out multivariate multiple regression analysis. We found that in all of the systems, 480% of the total variance of the prokaryotic assemblage composition (as ratios between bacteria and archaea and crenarchaea and euryarchaea) was explained by the availability of trophic resources (in term of phytopigments, biopolymeric C and C released by the viral shunt) and by the 'viral predatory pressure' (that is, VIPM). These findings suggest that the structure of the prokaryotic assemblages that inhabit these mud volcanoes is not only dependant on the geochemical features and processes of mud volcano ecosystems but also on synergic interactions with both bottomup (that is, available trophic resources for prokaryotic assemblages, including phytopigments) and top-down (that is, viral-mediated prokaryotic mortality) controlling factors. Overall, our results highlight the significant roles of viral infection in mud volcano sediments for sustaining the metabolism of prokaryotes and for the shaping of their assemblage structure, and they provide new clues towards an understanding of cold-seep ecosystem functioning.",Cinzia Corinaldesi,2012,22170423,10.1038/ismej.2011.185
52131258,Steep redox gradient and biogeochemical cycling driven by deeply sourced fluids and gases in a terrestrial mud volcano,"Mud volcanoes provide an accessible channel through which deep subsurface environments can be observed. The manner in which deeply sourced materials shape biogeochemical processes and microbial communities in such geological features remains largely unknown. This study characterized redox transitions, biogeochemical fluxes and microbial communities for samples collected from a methane-rich mud volcano in southwestern Taiwan. Our results indicated that oxygen penetration was confined within the upper 4 mm of fluids/muds and counteracted by the oxidation of pyrite, dissolved sulfide, methane and organic matter at various degrees. Beneath the oxic zone, anaerobic sulfur oxidation, sulfate reduction, anaerobic methanotrophy and methanogenesis were compartmentalized into different depths in the pool periphery, forming a metabolic network that efficiently cycles methane and sulfur. Community members affiliated with various Proteobacteria capable of aerobic oxidation of sulfur, methane and methyl compounds were more abundant in the anoxic zone with diminished sulfate and high methane. These findings suggest either the requirement of alternative electron acceptors or a persistent population that once flourished in the oxic zone. Overall, this study demonstrates the distribution pattern for a suite of oxidative and reductive metabolic reactions along a steep redox gradient imposed by deep fluids in a mud volcano ecosystem.","Deep subsurface environments have been estimated to harbor up to 5 × 10 30 cells, probably with equal contributions from the terrestrial and marine realms (Onstott et al. 1998; Whitman, Coleman and Wiebe 1998; Lipp et al. 2008; Kallmeyer et al. 2012; McMahon and Parnell 2014) . Such a huge quantity of biomass constitutes the largest microbial reservoir on Earth, and can profoundly affect the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur between the crust, hydrosphere, and atmosphere on contemporary and geological time scales (Whitman, Coleman and Wiebe 1998) . However, uncovering the distribution, diversity, composition and function of microbial communities inhabiting deep subsurface environments is challenging, owing to rare and costly access to representative samples. Mud volcanoes (MVs) are cone shaped, circular manifestations on land or the seafloor, and represent the expression of a fracture network that often extends to a depth of several kilometers (Mazzini and Etiope 2017) . As advection dominates over diffusion for fluid transport in a fracture network, relatively rapid migration can occur with minimal alterations of the fluid and gas emanating from a mud cone or pool (Dimitrov 2002) . Therefore, MVs provide a direct, effective means to recover deep microbial communities and fluid characteristics, and constrain the connectivity of a deep source to shallow groundwater. In addition, deeply seated communities could have been impacted by a number of environmental factors since their initial deposition on the seafloor . The manner in which microbial communities respond to such changes over the course of various geological processes (e.g. compaction, pressure-temperature change and fault displacement) remains largely unknown. Despite the continuous delivery of deeply sourced materials into surface environments, the physical and chemical contexts of MVs are greatly controlled by the dynamic interplay between biotic and abiotic processes (Mazzini and Etiope 2017) . Among these processes, the most striking appears to be the penetration of atmospheric oxygen, through which the reducing power associated with the upward transport fluids is counteracted (Boetius and Wenzhöfer 2013) . The oxidant-reductant interaction produces a redox gradient that leads to the proliferation and coexistence of microorganisms with a spectrum of oxygen affinity and metabolic capability (Nisbet and Sleep 2001) , and facilitates the regeneration of electron acceptors, and energy and material exchange at the oxic-anoxic boundary (Thomson et al. 1993) . Previous studies using a static chamber or microelectrode have shown that a significant fraction of total/diffusive oxygen fluxes or oxygen uptake rates in marine seeps or MVs (mostly >50%) are accounted for by aerobic methane oxidation near the seafloor (Boetius and Wenzhöfer 2013; Khripounoff et al. 2015) . Thiotrophic and organotrophic oxygen consumption plays a relatively minor role, even though sulfate is abundant. Whether the pattern and magnitude of oxygen penetration and dominant metabolism responsible for oxygen consumption in marine settings could be directly extrapolated to terrestrial counterparts with an infinitely large oxygen reservoir and scarce sulfate is not well established. This study aims to determine the biogeochemical processes and element cycling imposed by the discharge of deeply sourced, reducing materials in the Shin-Yan-Ny-Hu (SYNH) MV of southwestern Taiwan. Vertical concentration profiles of dissolved oxygen and sulfide at millimeter resolution, and of sulfate, methane and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at centimeter resolution were obtained for samples distributed in different compartments of the MV. These data were integrated with the abundance of specific taxonomic groups based on the 16S rRNA gene, alpha subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase gene (pmoA), and beta subunit of dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene (dsrB) to constrain the material fluxes, and determine the origins of microbial communities, and niche and metabolic compartmentalization along the redox transition in the methane-rich MV ecosystem. Furthermore, the sequence data were compared with those for sediments in the South China Sea to address the dispersal of microbial seedbanks undergoing long-term geological perturbation.  The SYNHMV is one of the MVs distributed along the NE-SW trending Chishan fault zone in southwestern Taiwan. This fault is part of a series of west-propagating thrust systems formed by the subduction of the Eurasian Plate underneath the Philippine Sea Plate, and is responsible for the exhumation of sediments that had once been deposited in the continental margin and South China Sea (Teng and Lin 2004) . The field site is characterized by two circular structures (a cone-shaped mud pie (SYNH01) and a mud pool (SYNH02)). Additional site background is provided in the supplementary methods. The SYNH02 was selected as our primary field site because vigorous bubbling and fluid discharge created a strong redox gradient and deposited a layer of soft mud in the pool periphery. Before sample collection, several parameters (including temperature, conductivity, pH, redox potential and salinity) of fluids near the main bubbling feature were measured on site using portable probes (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, USA). Sampling was performed at stations categorized into three types: (i) bubbling fluids in the pool (names starting with BF), (ii) fluidized muds near the pool margin (names starting with PM) and (iii) muds in the pool periphery (names starting with PP) (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). Field campaigns were conducted in November 2016, June 2017 and August 2017. In brief, bubbling fluids were scooped using a sterilized cup. Fluid and sediment columns in all categories of stations were collected using sterilized core liners. The lengths of the fluid and mud columns were 20 cm and between 10 and 52 cm, respectively. Simultaneous profiling of dissolved oxygen, pH and hydrogen sulfide was carried out using microelectrodes controlled by a field motor connected to a multimeter (Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark). The tips of the microelectrodes were aligned perpendicular to the surface of fluids/muds. Measurements were carried out at 1-mm resolution until 10-12 cm was reached. Calibrations of microelectrodes for O 2 (OX-100, Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S-100, Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark) and pH (pH-100, Unisense, Aarhus, Denmark) were performed either on site or one day before profiling, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. Detailed calibrations for microelectrode measurements are described in the supplementary methods. Detailed sample processing and preservation procedures are described in the supplementary methods. Concentrations of CH 4 and DIC were analyzed using a 6890N gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a Porapak Q packed column (3 m), a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector. Carbon isotope compositions of CH 4 and DIC were measured using a MAT253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) connected with a GC Isolink (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Detailed methods for GC ramping and sample acidification could be referred to . Delta notation (δ 13 C = (R sample /R standard − 1) × 1000 , where R is the ratio of 13 C to 12 C, and the standard is Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) was used in reporting the data. The uncertainty for individual measurements was less than 0.2 . Two anions in the filtrates, Cl − and SO 4 2− , were analyzed using an ICS-3000 ion chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The analysis was carried out in duplicate with an uncertainty of <2%. The CRS (chromium reducible sulfur; operationally defined to be equivalent to pyrite) and AVS (acid volatile sulfur; operationally defined to be equivalent to monosulfide minerals) concentrations were measured using the methods described by Canfield et al. (1986) . The analysis was carried out in duplicate with an uncertainty of <2%. Diffusive flux was calculated using the following equation: Porosity was first calculated from the water content, assuming that the average density of minerals constituting muds was 2.5 g cm −3 . The porosities obtained within the target depth interval were averaged. The diffusivity of a specific ion or molecule at 25 • C and 6 ppt salinity was adopted from Tse and Sandall (1979) , Krom and Berner (1980) , Iversen and Jørgensen (1993) and Tamimi et al. (1994) . Maximum fluxes of dissolved oxygen at the air-fluid/mud interface were calculated for all stations. Averaged fluxes of sulfide near the air-fluid/mud interface and/or at depths below the sulfate-depletion zone in the pool periphery were calculated. Averaged fluxes of sulfate were also calculated for stations near the pool margin and in the pool periphery, where downward-decreasing sulfate concentrations were clear. Additional calculations were performed for the air-mud interface considering a concentration gradient between the bubbling fluid and the top pore water, and for the upper few centimeters at stations PP4, PP8 and PP9, where downward-increasing sulfate concentrations were observed. Averaged fluxes of methane were calculated only for stations in the pool periphery. The DNA was extracted from 2 to 5 g of samples from the bubbling fluids (BF2016 and BF16-2.5 cm), and all samples from stations PP4 and PP11 using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA extracts were stored at −80 • C for subsequent analyzes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was applied to the DNA extracts obtained from 11 depths at station PP4, all depths at station PP11 and two bubbling fluids using the primers F515 (5 -GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-3 ) and R806 (5 -CCC GTC AAT TCM TTT RAG T-3 ) for the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes. Although these primers have been reported to be less efficient in generating archaeal amplicons (Parada et al. 2016) , they were used to facilitate the comparison with other studies. The schemes and reagents for PCR and downstream processing of amplicons were the same as those described in Tu et al. (2017) . Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to analyze the copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes for bacteria, archaea and ANME-1, and of dsrB genes for sulfate reducers and pmoA genes for types I and II aerobic methanotrophs in all DNA extracts using a MyiQ Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Standard preparations, primers for 16S rRNA genes and PCR conditions were the same as those described in Wang et al. (2014) and Tu et al. (2017) . Primer combinations of DSRp2060F/DSR4R (Geets et al. 2006 ) and A189F/mb661r (Costello and Lidstrom 1999) were used to quantify the abundance of dsrB and pmoA genes, respectively. The copy numbers of genes were calculated with the length of amplicon, assuming 650 g mol −1 of one base pair of DNA. Sequences of 16S rRNA gene amplicons were analyzed using the Mothur 1.35 following the standard protocols described by Schloss et al. (2009) . Unique reads were aligned to the Silva SSU dataset of the NR 128 release (www.silva.org). Reads not aligned in the same region were removed. Sequence regions beyond the primers were truncated. Potential chimeric sequences were detected and removed using the UCHIME program (Edgar et al. 2011) . The obtained sequences were deposited in the Gen-Bank with the accession number SRP133776. The number of sequences in each sample after quality filtering is shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Taxonomy of each unique sequence was assigned using the Silva SSU dataset of the NR 128 release as the reference. Taxonomy assignments with bootstrap values greater than 80% were considered valid. Sequences sharing more than 97% identity were further clustered into individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the nearest neighbor algorithm (Schloss and Westcott 2011) . Based on the rarefied dataset (n = 26,927), alpha diversity indices, such as the numbers of observed OTUs, Chao1 and inverse Simpson indices (Hill 1973; Chao, Sederoff and Levings 1984; Faith 1992) , were computed. The dissimilarity matrix between samples was computed using the Bray-Curtis method (Bray and Curtis 1957) and visualized through the ordination of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS).  Fluid temperatures, pH and redox potentials in the main bubbling feature (near station BF16) varied from 42 • C to 46 • C, 7.75 to 8.29 and −108 to −97 mV, respectively, during three field trips. The temperature decreased rapidly to the ambient level as the distance from the bubbling feature increased ( Fig. S1 , Supporting Information). Samples retrieved from near the bubbling features in the pool (stations BF15 to BF19) were characterized by high water content (>50 wt% with most values around 60 wt%; Fig. S2 , Supporting Information) and relatively low and uniform chloride (93 to 102 mM) and sulfate (most less than 40 μM) concentrations ( Fig. 1 ). Methane concentrations ranged between 0.8 and 3.3 mM with most δ 13 C values being around −34 ± 1 . One exception occurred at station BF15, where δ 13 C values ranged between −42 and −35 , with the top one being most depleted in 13 C. The DIC concentrations ranged between 16 and 24 mM, and generally increased with increasing depth, with most δ 13 C values being around -0.7 ± 0.2 . Dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased sharply from a concentration near the atmospheric equilibrium to one below the detection limit in the upper 4.0 mm ( Fig. 1 ). Sulfide concentrations generally increased with increasing depth. The depth ranges for the abrupt increase from low to high sulfide concentrations (up to ∼180 μM) varied among sites. Samples retrieved from near the pool margin (stations PM10, PM13 and PM14) were characterized by decreasing water content (50−55 wt% at the top) with increasing depth (Fig. S2 , Supporting Information). Chloride and sulfate concentrations ranged mostly between 86 and 119 mM and between 30 and 170 μM, respectively, with small magnitudes of variations along depths (Fig. 2 ). Methane concentrations ranged between 0.01 and 2.6 mM and increased with increasing depth. In contrast, δ 13 C values of methane decreased with increasing depth. The DIC concentrations ranged between 13 and 22 mM, whereas its δ 13 C values varied between −0.3 and 2.9 . Dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased sharply with increasing depth, and varied in a pattern similar to that observed for the pool fluids. Sulfide concentrations at stations PM10 and PM13 increased from below the detection limit to 120-386 μM at 2 cm, followed by small variations between 2 and 4 cm, and a decreasing trend with increasing depth thereafter. Samples retrieved from the pool periphery (stations PP4, PP8, PP9, PP11 and PP12) were characterized by 23-52 wt% water content. At stations PP4, PP8 and PP9, water content decreased sharply below 5-10 cm ( Fig. S2 , Supporting Information). Chloride concentrations (up to 238.7 mM) generally decreased with increasing depth (Fig. 3 ). Variations in sulfate concentration could have been categorized into two patterns. The first type (stations PP4, PP8 and PP9) was characterized by an increase of up to 1.7 mM in the upper 10-20 cm, followed by a sharp decline to below the detection limit further down. The other type of pattern was characterized by a decreasing trend with increasing depth. Whereas methane concentrations increased from tens of micromolar to up to 4.0 mM with increasing depth, its δ 13 C values decreased from around -35 to as low as -53 with increasing depth. The DIC concentrations and isotopic compositions exhibited various depth-dependent patterns. Dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased sharply to below the detection limit in the upper 2 mm. Sulfide concentrations increased to up to 630 μM with increasing depth at stations PP11 and PP12. Pyrite concentrations ranged between 0.7 and 1.0 mg-S g −1 with relatively high values (0.90 ± 0.02 mg-S g −1 ) corresponding to the upper sulfate-depletion zone (Fig. S3 , Supporting Information) and low values (0.81 ± 0.06 mg-S g −1 ) at greater depths. The AVS concentrations were below the detection limit for all samples. Downward fluxes of dissolved oxygen near the air-fluid/mud interface ranged between 1.82 × 10 −2 and 3.06 × 10 −2 mol m −2 d −1 , whereas upward fluxes of sulfide in the upper 1.6 cm ranged between 6.50 × 10 −4 and 9.37 × 10 −3 mol m −2 d −1 (Table 1) . Upward sulfide fluxes in the anoxic zone ranged between 1.72 × 10 −4 and 1.41 × 10 −3 mol m −2 d −1 . Downward fluxes of sulfate ranged between 1.02 × 10 −4 and 6.94 × 10 −3 mol m −2 d −1 , with values in the pool periphery being greater than those near the pool margin. Upward sulfate fluxes ranged between 0 and 1.74 × 10 −2 mol m −2 d −1 in the upper 1 cm and between 2.90 × 10 −4 and 1.21 × 10 −3 mol m −2 d −1 at depths above the sulfate maximum. Upward fluxes of methane ranged between 2.73 × 10 −4 and 3.40 × 10 −3 mol m −2 d −1 . Analyzes of 16S rRNA genes yielded 1 397 132 sequences. The numbers of observed OTUs were highest at 32.3 cm at station PP4 and 19.0 cm at station PP11, and decreased toward both the top and bottom of the cores (Table S1, Supporting Information). The trends of the Chao1 and inverse Simpson indices resembled the pattern of observed OTUs. At station PP4, community components shifted from the second quadrant for BF2016 to the third quadrants for the depths with greater δ 13 C values of methane and high sulfate, to the second quadrant for the depths with depleted sulfate and finally to the first quadrant for the depths with high methane (Fig. S4 , Supporting Information). At station PP11, community components shifted from the second quadrant for BF16-2.5 cm to around the negative NMDS2 axis for the depths with depleted sulfate and to around the positive NMDS1 axis for the depths with high methane. Such changes of community compositions were correlated with depth (R 2 = 0.60, P < 0.01), sulfate (R 2 = 0.55, P < 0.01), chloride (R 2 = 0.48, P < 0.01), methane (R 2 = 0.52, P < 0.01) and δ 13 C values of methane (R 2 = 0.47, P < 0.01). A total of 25 482 bacterial and 1167 archaeal OTUs, representing 217 classes (184 bacterial and 33 archaeal) within 82 phyla, were recovered. The dominant bacterial and archaeal phyla (and subdivisions of Proteobacteria; >5% of the total reads) included Atribacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria and Euryarchaeota (Fig. 4) . Proportions of individual phyla varied among individual samples and between stations ( Fig. 4 ; Table S2 , Supporting Information). For bubbling fluids, the dominant community members (>0.5%) were related to uncultured microorganisms, and to the families/genera Peptococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Syntrophorhabdus, Thermodesulfovibrio, Desulfonatronum, Methanosaeta, Smithella, Marinospirillum and Thioalkalispira (Table  S2 , Supporting Information). These community members either diminished or declined with increasing depth in cored muds. For cored muds, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was high (>50%) in the upper 5-10 cm and decreased with increasing depth. In contrast, the abundance of Atribacteria, Chloroflexi, Deltaproteobacteria, Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes either increased with increasing depth or reached high values at middle depths ( Fig. S4  qPCR analysis indicated that bubbling fluids contained low gene copy numbers of all investigated taxonomic groups (Fig. 5) . In cored muds, archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers ranged from the limit of detection to 5.3 × 10 5 copies g −1 at station PP4 and 1.2 × 10 6 copies g −1 at station PP11. Their abundance generally increased with increasing depth, showing high values in the high methane zone. The ANME-1 16S rRNA gene copy numbers ranged from the limit of detection to up to 6.3 × 10 3 copies g −1 . Their abundance peaked in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) and declined rapidly toward both shallower and deeper levels. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were up to two orders of magnitude more abundant than archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers. Although their abundance generally increased with increasing depth, relatively high values deviating from the increasing trend were also observed. The abundance of dsrB genes ranged from the limit of detection to 3.6 × 10 4 copies g −1 at station PP4 and 3.0 × 10 5 copies g −1 at station PP11. The abundance of pmoA genes ranged from the limit of detection to 3.8 × 10 4 copies g −1 at station PP4 and 5.1 × 10 5 copies g −1 at station PP11. The high values of both genes occurred in the SMTZ and high methane zones.  Fluids and gases emanating from the bubbling features of MVs are generally considered to represent materials resembling characteristics of a deep source. A recent study based on the abundance of doubly substituted isotopologues ( 13 CDH 3 and 12 CD 2 H 2 ) indicated that methane discharged from this MV was generated by thermal maturation of organic matter at ∼150 • C (Rumble et al. 2018) . Such a temperature estimate could be translated into a depth of ∼6.3 km, assuming an average surface temperature of 24 • C and a geothermal gradient of 20 • C km −1 (Wu et al. 2013) . This temperature or depth range for methane formation, however, exceeds the highest temperature (122 • C) ever reported for microbial growth under laboratory conditions (Takai et al. 2008) . This finding suggests that the gas/fluid source is sterilized by a local geothermal gradient and decoupled from the microbial source. Mixing of deeply sourced, sterilized fluids with shallow, cellcontaining groundwater appears to be the most plausible mechanism to explain the origin of the observed microbial communities. In this study, a total of 5.4-11.4% of the community members in two individual bubbling fluids were closely related to Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii, Methanosaeta thermophila and Thermococcus mexicalis (Fig. S5 ; Table S3 , Supporting Information). Sequence analyzes further revealed that these sequences were nearly identical (≤2 bp difference) to the near full-length sequences affiliated (≥96% identity) with thermophiles and hyperthermophiles within these lineages obtained in a previous study . If these community members are truly thermophilic or hyperthermophilic, as inferred from sequence identity, they represent the deeply sourced components that contribute to the overall community assemblages. In addition, culture experiments have shown that these strains can grow at temperatures ranging between 30 and 105 • C, with optimum growth temperatures between 55 and 100 • C ( Kamagata et al. 1992; Henry et al. 1994; Imachi et al. 2002; Lepage et al. 2004 ). If these potential thermophiles or hyperthermophiles proliferate at the corresponding optimum temperatures, they could have been introduced into the fracture network that is open to the input of groundwater from multiple depths between 1.5 and 3.8 km. Alternatively, temperatures ranging between 60 calculated for the deeper intervals below the sulfate-depletion zone in the pool peripheral. 3 Fluxes of sulfate were calculated for stations near the pool margin and in the pool peripheral where downward decreasing sulfate gradients in the upper portion of cored mud were clear and mud content was greater. Additional calculations were performed for the top few centimeters at stations PP4, PP8 and PP9 where downward increasing sulfate gradients were observed. 4 Fluxes of methane were calculated only for stations in the pool peripheral because methane is highly mobile and the gradient could be easily disturbed by the bubbling agitation. 5 Diffisivities for different ions or molecules are adapted from Tse and Sandall (1979) , Krom and Berner (1980) , Iversen and Jørgensen (1993) and Tamimi et al. (1994) . and 70 • C could enable the proliferation of the potential thermophiles. The microbial communities could have originated from a source at depths equivalent to this temperature range (1.8-2.3 km deep). Overall, these deeply sourced, cell-free fluids mixed with groundwater inherited with thermophilic and mesophilic communities ascend to land surface, thereby providing an abundant supply of electron donors, reducing power and microbial seeds to shape redox transitions and biogeochemical processes near the surface of the MV ecosystem. Our results indicated that chloride concentrations of the top fluids increased from 93-102 mM near the bubbling features to 92-118 mM near the pool margin and 116-239 mM in the pool periphery. Such a progressive increase of chloride concentration suggests a decreasing frequency of the submergence of mud beneath fluids and an increasing frequency of exposure to the atmosphere as the distance from the bubbling feature increases. Since chloride is inert to biological and most abiotic reactions, the variation pattern combined with the negative correlation between chloride and water content (Fig. S6 , Supporting Information) further suggests that evaporation plays a role in increasing solute concentration. Similar variations were observed for sulfate, with low concentrations (≤110 μM) occurring near the bubbling feature and high concentrations (up to 3.59 mM) in the pool periphery. Like chloride, sulfate concentrations were also negatively correlated with water content (Fig. S6, Supporting Information) . The pattern of solute enhancement is, however, not exactly the same between chloride and sulfate. If the chloride concentration of the bubbling fluids is considered the source characteristic, evaporation could lead to chloride enrichment in the pool periphery by a factor of 1.3-2.6 (with the exception of station PP9). For comparison, the enrichment factor of sulfate ranged from 7.7 to 89.8 (with the exception of station PP9). The differential enrichment of solutes suggests that an additional source of sulfate is required. The concentrations of top dissolved sulfide in the pool PP11 (B) . Data points at zero depth represent gene copy numbers for samples collected from the bubbling features. Analyzed genes and taxonomic groups include 16S rRNA genes for bacterial, archaeal and ANME-1 members, dsrB genes and pmoA genes. Open circles and dashed line represent the copy number below the limit of detection (either 50 or 100 copies g −1 ). The uncertainty of analysis represents one standard deviation of quadruple replicates. periphery were comparable to those in the pool or near the pool margin and far less than those of top sulfate (Figs 1-3) . Pyrite was detected throughout the cored muds. In this regard, instead of dissolved sulfide, the oxidation of pyrite with the production of sulfuric acid is perhaps the best explanation for such large increases in sulfate levels at the air-mud interface. Although abiotic oxidation of pyrite under atmospheric conditions is generally considered to be slow (Balci et al. 2007) , whether abiotic or microbial oxidation accounts for the observed accumulation of sulfate remains uncertain. Furthermore, the oxidation of pyrite could have proceeded with the consumption of oxygen, thereby contributing to oxygen depletion, as was observed in the present study (Figs 1-3 and Discussion section). Overall, pyrite oxidation is needed to charge the surface sediments with millimolar sulfate and convert sediments to anoxic conditions, both of which provide environmental contexts that are favorable for the development of anaerobic metabolism. The profiles of dissolved oxygen were all similar regardless of the site category or geochemical characteristics. In addition, oxygen supersaturation was not observed near the air-fluid/mud interface, suggesting that photosynthetic production of oxygen was limited, probably because of substantial light attenuation caused by suspended muds and oily patches. The diffusive fluxes of dissolved oxygen were calculated to span from 18.2 to 30.6 mmol m −2 d −1 (Table 1 ). Since gas bubbling agitated pool fluids vigorously and the measurements were carried out in the static mode off site, the derived flux represents the minimum value for the bubbling feature, but would more closely mimic the true value for the station near the pool margin or in the pool periphery. This range was comparable with most values (10-200 mmol m −2 d −1 ) reported for deep marine cold seeps and MVs (Boetius and Wenzhöfer 2013) , and suggests that the reducing power was strong enough to confine the oxygen penetration within the upper few millimeters. Dissolved sulfide might serve as a reductant for oxygen depletion. Among all stations, upward sulfide fluxes near the air-fluid/mud interface at five stations (BF16, BF17, BF19, PM10 and PM13) ranged between 0.65 and 9.37 mmol m −2 d −1 (Table 1) . Given that the stoichiometric ratio of sulfide to oxygen is 0.5 for sulfide oxidation: The upward reducing power of sulfide within the upper 1 cm of fluids/muds constitutes 6.3-90.1% of the downward oxygen fluxes. Since the upward sulfide gradient occurred at depths where dissolved oxygen was still present, microbial and abiotic oxidation of dissolved sulfide contributed both to the consumption of dissolved oxygen and production of sulfate. Certainly, other reductants, such as methane expelled into the pool or produced in situ, and pyrite and organic matters associated with emanated muds also play a role in the consumption of oxygen. For example, upward fluxes of methane in the upper sediments at the pool periphery stations ranged between 0.27 and 2.53 mmol m −2 d −1 . If the downward fluxes of dissolved oxygen at these stations were similar to those at other stations in the pool periphery, the upward methane fluxes contributed 2.2-16.6% of equivalent reducing power. Similarly, upward sulfate fluxes near the air-mud interface of stations PP4, PP8, PP11 and PP12 ranged between 4.97 and 17.4 mmol m −2 d −1 . As discussed earlier, these fluxes or concentration gradients were generated by pyrite oxidation. Using the stoichiometric ratio of O 2 to sulfate (15/8), pyrite oxidation contributed 38.2−179.2% of equivalent reducing power. To further address potential metabolic reactions across redox gradients, the geochemical characteristics susceptible to microbial processes and 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with specific lineages (orders/families/genera) were integrated. In addition to using geochemical characteristics, potential metabolic reactions of specific community members were also inferred on the basis of high sequence identity to known strains and common metabolisms shared among most or all members within specific lineages. We note that sequence analyzes do not necessarily recover the thorough diversity and predict functional capacity and activity of the microbial community. Our combined data indicated that some aerobic metabolisms were active in the pool and contributed to the production of CO 2 . For example, δ 13 C values of methane and DIC from a depth of 7.5 cm at station BF19 were −30 and −1.2 , respectively. These values were distinct from those of methane (greater) and DIC (less) from the bubbling fluid, suggesting the presence of active methanotrophy. Whether such spotty methanotrophic activities were aerobic or anaerobic remains uncertain, as the relative abundance of methanotrophs affiliated with Methylomicrobium and the ANME-1 lineage were only around 0.1 and 0.5%, respectively ( Fig. 4; Table S2 , Supporting Information). Furthermore, a high proportion of community members (21-57%) were affiliated with heterotrophs that were taxonomically assigned to the Gamma-and Delta-subdivisions of Proteobacteria (including Alcanivoracaceae, Alteromonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Smithella spp. and Syntrophorhabdaceae) (Yakimov et al. 1998; López-Pérez and Rodriguez-Valera 2014; Tan, Nesb and Foght 2014; Jayamani and Cupples 2015) . Although the exact organic entities degraded by these microorganisms were not clear, the abundance of these heterotrophs was high in the bubbling fluid (57% for BF2016 and 20% for BF16-2.5 cm) and the top mud (53% for station PP4 and 59% for station PP11), and decreased with increasing depth (Fig. 4) . This distribution pattern suggests their physiological preference for habitats where oxygen is accessible. Despite aerobic respiratory metabolism, anaerobic processes also play a role in community functions in the mud pool. In particular, the lowest δ 13 C values of methane were around −42 , a value that is 7 more negative than those of the bubbling fluid and suggests the role of in situ methanogenesis. For comparison, a total of 0.1-4.0% of sequences related to Methanosaetaceae, Methanobacteriaceae and Methanoregulaceae were detected. Previous incubation experiments also indicated that methanogens exploiting acetate, methyl compounds and CO 2 were all viable in this MV . These results suggest that transient in situ methanogenesis could have generated methane at quantities that were sufficient to create a patchy distribution of distinct isotopic compositions of methane. The geochemical results suggest a transitional pattern from one end component (the pool) that was highly impacted by the advection supply of deeply sourced fluids and gases, to the other end component (the pool periphery) modulated by surface evaporation and oxidation processes and subsurface microbial processes. Therefore, only the biogeochemical processes in the pool periphery comprise the focus of further discussion. The geochemical pattern of mud columns in the pool periphery marked a SMTZ, indicating stratified distribution of sulfate reduction, anaerobic oxidation of methane and methanogenesis (Iversen and Jørgensen 1985; Parkes et al. 2007; Leloup et al. 2009 ). Whereas such a geochemical pattern is analogous to marine counterparts, there is one major difference such that the maximum sulfate concentrations were not always observed at the top in the terrestrial MV. In marine seeps or MVs, seawater sulfate acts as an infinitely large reservoir to fuel subsurface sulfate reducers through downward diffusion. In this study, sulfate concentrations increased from ∼0.9 mM at the top, to above 1.4 mM at 10 cm of station PP4, and 20 cm of station PP8, a depth range where oxygen was scarce. As barite and gypsum were absent and dissolved sulfide was not high, the increase of sulfate in the anoxic zone is best explained by the microbial oxidation of sulfur-bearing minerals (Lovley and Phillips 1994; Weber, Thamdrup and Habicht 2016; Wasmund, Mußmann and Loy 2017) . In addition to the anoxic production of sulfate, the sulfate-depletion zone was underlain by a zone of increased sulfide levels at stations PP9, PP11 and PP12. The segregation of the sulfide maximum from the largest downward sulfate gradient suggests sequestration of dissolved sulfide by iron oxyhydroxide, and cryptic sulfur cycling at the base of the sulfate reduction zone. The geochemical interpretation regarding sulfur metabolism (sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation) is supported by 16S rRNA gene screening and qPCR results. Our analyzes indicated that sequences related to a number of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria mainly affiliated with Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Thioalkalispira spp. within Gammaproteobacteria and Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus within Deltaproteobacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria mainly affiliated with Desulfatitalea spp. within Deltaproteobacteria were detected throughout the cored muds ( Fig. 4 ; Table S2 , Supporting Information). The abundance of dsrB genes either peaked or increased to a high level in the sulfate-depletion zone (Fig. 5) . The sulfur-oxidizing bacteria described above have been reported to oxidize various forms of reduced sulfur (e.g. sulfide, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur) under oxic conditions, or with nitrate under anoxic conditions (Sorokin et al., 2001 (Sorokin et al., , 2002 Melton et al. 2016; Thorup et al. 2017) . The likelihood of cable bacteria in long-ranging electron transport is rejected, as (1) the proton gradient measured in this study was only ∼1.2 units; (2) sequences related to known cable bacteria were absent and (3) the distance from the sulfide maximum to the pH maximum was far greater than that ever reported for the development of cell chains (Pfeffer et al. 2012) . Furthermore, the coexistence of abundant microorganisms that are capable of catalyzing oxidative and reductive pathways at low-sulfate depths suggests that sulfur has to be rapidly cycled between the oxidized and reduced forms. The complementary variation between the concentration and isotopic composition of methane suggests the presence of anaerobic oxidation of methane underlain by methanogenesis. This interpretation is corroborated by the 13 C-depleted DIC in the low-methane zone and the 13 C-enriched DIC in the high methane zone. Geochemical inferences were also supported by gene screening, through which sequences related to ANME-1 members and methanogens using CO 2 and acetate (Methanobacteriaceae and Methanosaetaceae) were detected. In addition, the copy numbers of ANME-1 members increased by a factor of 10 between the SMTZ and adjacent methanogenic or sulfate reduction zones. Assuming that archaeal communities were only composed of methanogens and anaerobic methanotrophs (based on sequence data), gene copy numbers of methanogens would peak in or near the methanogenic zone. The efficiency of these methanotrophs in consuming methane (76% of methane removal based on flux comparison) is high and similar to those of marine counterparts (Boetius and Wenzhöfer 2013) . The flux calculation also indicated various ratios of upward methane fluxes to downward sulfate fluxes across the SMTZ at different stations, suggesting various degrees of the dependence of anaerobic oxidation of methane on sulfate reduction. In addition to metabolisms discussed above, the abundance of sequences related to type I aerobic methanotrophs (mainly affiliated with Methylomicrobium spp.) and methylotrophs increased at depths greater than 10 cm, where oxygen was scarce. Such a distribution pattern is comparable with the qPCR results, in which pmoA gene copy numbers peaked at 40 cm at station PP4, and at 17.5 cm at station PP11, and showed a substantial decline above the SMTZ (Fig. 5) . The increased abundance of these community members known to oxidize either methane or methyl compounds with the consumption of oxygen in the anoxic zone is unexpected. One possibility is that the increased abundance of methanotrophs and methylotrophs represent the residue community members that once flourished on/near the surface where oxygen was available, but were later buried by sediment deposition. Alternatively, these methanotrophs possess metabolic flexibility, as they can exploit electron acceptors other than oxygen (e.g. nitrate) (Kits, Klotz and Stein 2015) . Current data are not conclusive to assert any possibility. Despite community changes associated with transient and dynamic perturbations near the surface on a contemporary time scale, the effects of long-term (million-year scaled) geological processes were also investigated. The principle stems from the fact that the formation (Kutingkeng) hosting the investigated MV was formed in the outer continental shelf during the Pliocene-Pleistocene and was progressively accreted and exhumed above sea level by the late fault activity driven by subduction of the Eurasian plate (Teng and Lin, 2004; Chen et al. 2017) . Under this tectonic framework, current sediments in the South China Sea and offshore southwestern Taiwan represent the modern analog of Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments hosting the SYNHMV. To address this scenario, published community compositions recovered from cores distributed in the South China Sea (Lin et al. 2014; Graw et al. 2018) were merged with the data reported in the present study. Community dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis) was computed and visualized using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA). The assessment was based on the assumption that microbial communities in current South China Sea sediments are the same as those in the geological past. The analysis only incorporated studies with sequences that overlapped the same hypervariable regions. Therefore, limited spatial resolution (three sites from the abyssal plain and one site from the continental slope) was noted. Our analyzes showed that community compositions were distinct between individual site categories (abyssal plain, continental slope and terrestrial MV; Fig. 6 ). In addition to site variance, communities also varied by metabolic categorization (sulfate reduction versus methanogenesis) to a lesser degree, suggesting that different combinations of community members could lead to similar community functions. Detailed sequence analyzes for individual OTUs indicated that greater fractions of sequences or OTUs were shared between communities in individual site categories or in marine versus terrestrial environments (Fig. 6) . A total of 1535 out of 41 953 and 3561 out of 42 395 OTUs were shared between communities in the abyssal plain and terrestrial MV, respectively. The numbers of shared OTUs were reduced to 299 (out of 56 001) for all marine sediments and nine (out of 97 935) when all marine and terrestrial samples were considered. These nine persistent OTUs were more abundant in the continental slope (site MD3280) and at sites U1432 and U1433 (2-7% of sequences), less abundant at site U1431 (0.6%) and least abundant in the terrestrial MV (0.01-0.04%). Sequences of these persistent OTUs were classified in Elusimicrobia, Lokiarchaeota, Hadesarchaea, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria (Table S4 , Supporting Information). These results are partly comparable with the community pattern commonly recovered from marine sediments at depths of up to 100 m around the globe (Petro et al. 2017) . One notable discrepancy was observed among Atribacteria-related members. Although diverse and abundant Atribacteria-related OTUs were Lin et al. (2014) and IODP U1431-U1433 from Graw et al. (2018) ) and SYNHMV (this study). Venn diagrams comparing the numbers of OTUs shared between sites in (B) the South China Sea and (C) SYNHMV. The community variance was deduced by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences. To maximize the numbers of persistent OTUs shared between sites, no sequence resampling was applied. detected, all were confined to either marine or terrestrial environments. For example, OTU00002 in Table S2 (Supporting Information) was present in all terrestrial samples and constituted 2.4% of total sequences, but was absent in marine sediments. Overall, the present results suggest that these persistent members likely survive the stress imposed by diagenetic processes (e.g. burial, compaction and cementation), tectonic accretion and fault displacement, all of which account for the emplacement of sediments from marine into terrestrial environments over a time scale of millions of years. Analyzes of more samples at a higher spatial resolution and single-cell genomes are warranted to address the dispersal and selection mechanisms of microbial seedbanks across marine and terrestrial realms. Geochemical and molecular characterization of samples retrieved from different compartments of the SYNHMV indicated a steep redox transition, with oxygen penetration being confined to the upper 4 mm of pool fluids or muds in the pool periphery. Flux calculations indicate that the oxidation of dissolved sulfide and pyrite is an important driver for oxygen consumption at the air-fluid/mud interface. The steep oxygen gradient was underlain by the compartmentalization of anaerobic metabolic reactions, including sulfur oxidation, sulfate reduction, anaerobic oxidation of methane and methanogenesis along the depth of the pool periphery. Such metabolic zonation and organization facilitates the efficient consumption of upward-migrating methane produced in situ. Furthermore, potential aerobic methylotrophs and methanotrophs were more abundant at depths devoid of oxygen, revealing a distribution pattern that contradicts their most common physiological preference for oxygen, and suggesting either alternative electron acceptors or a persistent population that was once proliferating in the oxic zone. Our results demonstrate that the reducing, sterilized fluids originating from great depths were seeded with microbial populations during upward transport along the fracture network. These microorganisms formed a metabolic architecture that drove the intensive cycling of sulfur, methane and organic carbon along redox transitions, thereby altering the physical and chemical contexts of the mud pool and pool periphery.

19304315,Metabolic stratification driven by surface and subsurface interactions in a terrestrial mud volcano,"Terrestrial mud volcanism represents the prominent surface geological feature, where fluids and hydrocarbons are discharged along deeply rooted structures in tectonically active regimes. Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) directly emit the major gas phase, methane, into the atmosphere, making them important sources of greenhouse gases over geological time. Quantification of methane emission would require detailed insights into the capacity and efficiency of microbial metabolisms either consuming or producing methane in the subsurface, and establishment of the linkage between these methane-related metabolisms and other microbial or abiotic processes. Here we conducted geochemical, microbiological and genetic analyses of sediments, gases, and pore and surface fluids to characterize fluid processes, community assemblages, functions and activities in a methane-emitting MV of southwestern Taiwan. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that aerobic/anaerobic methane oxidation, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are active and compartmentalized into discrete, stratified niches, resembling those in marine settings. Surface evaporation and oxidation of sulfide minerals are required to account for the enhanced levels of sulfate that fuels subsurface sulfate reduction and anaerobic methanotrophy. Methane flux generated by in situ methanogenesis appears to alter the isotopic compositions and abundances of thermogenic methane migrating from deep sources, and to exceed the capacity of microbial consumption. This metabolic stratification is sustained by chemical disequilibria induced by the mixing between upward, anoxic, methane-rich fluids and downward, oxic, sulfate-rich fluids.","Mud volcanoes (MVs) and hydrocarbon seepages are ubiquitous in both marine and terrestrial environments. They are characterized by continuous or episodic discharges of gaseous fluids with unconsolidated, fine-grained sediments generated during clay dehydration, compaction dewatering or tectonic pressurization at depth (Kopf, 2004) . These surface expressions often represent the outlet of fluid conduits that tap into deep petroleum and natural gas reservoirs, thereby providing an accessible window to probe the characteristics of petroleum and gas sources, and the deep biosphere. Methane appears to be the major gaseous constituent released from most MVs. Recent estimates indicate that MVs and seepages onshore and offshore around the world might account for approximately 30% of the methane emission from natural sources (Etiope et al., 2008) . Considering the huge capacity of methane potentially stored in the subterranean or subseafloor strata (Milkov, 2004) , these geological sources might have been an important factor diverting the redox equilibrium in the atmosphere over geological time. Terrestrial MVs particularly have a vital role as methane and other hydrocarbons are directly released into the atmosphere. Therefore, any assessment of the greenhouse effect on a global scale has to consider the contribution of terrestrial MVs. Stable isotopic and molecular compositions of hydrocarbons have been broadly utilized to identify the hydrocarbon origin and to trace the hydrocarbon migration (Whiticar, 1990; Etiope et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010) . On the basis of d 13 C-CH 4 and d 2 H-CH 4 values, about 25% out of 143 studied MVs around the world release microbial methane or a mixture of microbial and thermogenic methane (Etiope et al., 2009) . In contrast, a plot of the same data set on the d 13 C-CH 4 versus C 1 /(C 2 þ C 3 ) diagram shows that most terrestrial MVs produce gas signals falling within an ambiguous sector due to post-genetic processes, such as microbial oxidation, mixing or molecular fractionation during migration (Etiope et al., 2009) . This contradictory interpretation illustrates the complexity in the identification of gas origin, as well as strengthens the importance of the post-formational microbial process at shallow depths. Only limited studies have been conducted to investigate microbial activities and community structures in terrestrial, methane-rich MVs (Alain et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2012; Wrede et al., 2012) . These studies reveal that archaeal communities are primarily composed of anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME groups for ANaerobic Methanotrophic Euryarchaeota) with different fractions of methanogens or Crenarchaeaota. Bacterial communities consist of diverse members taxonomically distributed across various phyla. The rates of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, however, outnumber those of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) by one to two orders of magnitude (Alain et al., 2006) . In addition, the correlation between geochemical profiles and community assemblages for sediments collected from the mud platform surrounding a bubbling pool suggests that AOM might be coupled to metal reduction (Chang et al., 2012 ). These results demonstrate a variety of potential electron-accepting processes involved in organic degradation and/or methanotrophy, and are in contrast with the predominance of ANME members and sulfate reducers, and high sulfate-dependent methanotrophic activities in marine hydrocarbon seepages (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2002; Treude et al., 2005; Knittel and Boetius, 2009 ). In terrestrial settings, sulfate abundances are generally much lower than in seawater. Whether sulfate-dependent metabolisms are active and how methane-related metabolisms interact with the imposed geochemical context in terrestrial MVs are not clear. This study aimed to uncover the key microbial and abiotic processes associated with the subsurfacesurface interactions that shaped the cycling of methane and other related compounds in terrestrial, methane-rich MVs. Using samples collected from the Shin-Yan-Ny-Hu MVs (SYNHMV) in southwestern Taiwan, geochemistry of pore water and gases, 16S rRNA gene diversity, abundance of functional genes extracted from metagenome data and culturing were integrated to constrain the spectrum of metabolic capability along a vertical profile.  The SYNHMV is located in the Yan-Chou area of southwestern Taiwan (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Figure S1 ) and comprises a cone-shaped structure (SYNH01) and a bubbling mud pool (SYNH02) (Figure 1 ). Muddy fluids mixed with abundant hydrocarbon gases are discharged out of the cone and pool, and drained toward the topographic depression. The fluid flux varies from time to time on the basis of visual inspection. The majority of samples were collected from the bubbling pool SYNH02 and its surrounding mud platform. Two field campaigns were conducted in 2007 and 2009. Before sample collection, several parameters (including temperature, conductivity, redox potential and pH) of bubbling and surface fluids were measured on site using the portable probes (WTW Multi 340i, Weilheim, Germany). Samples were collected from sediments retrieved by push-coring (core c1 in 2007, cores c2 and c3 in 2009), and from bubbling fluids (ew01 and ew02 in 2009) and surface fluids along an outflow channel (sw01 to sw06 in 2009) (Figure 1 ). Core c1 was retrieved for pilot analyses of anions and methane. Core c2 was used for detailed analyses of aqueous, gas and isotope geochemistry, whereas core c3 was used for incubation experiments and molecular analyses. All samples were processed in the field, stored in sterile containers with/without preservatives and shipped back to the laboratory either on dry ice (samples for molecular analyses) or at ambient temperature (samples for aqueous and gas chemistry and incubations). Detailed descriptions for sample processing and geochemical analyses can be found in Supplementary Information. Carbon-sulfur cycling in a terrestrial mud volcano T-W Cheng et al 16S rRNA gene analysis Genomic DNA for 16S rRNA gene analyses was extracted from 10-g sediments (from 1, 7, 11, 23 and 31 cm of core c3) and the bubbling fluid (ew01), using the UltraClean Mega Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and stored at -20 1C. Nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified on a Robocycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), using a bacterial forward primer B27F and a universal reverse primer U1492R for bacteria (Lane, 1991) , and an archaeal forward primer A8F and a universal reverse primer U1513r for archaea (Huber et al., 2002) . The PCR protocol and downstream approaches for purification of PCR products, cloning and sequencing were described previously (Lin et al., 2006) . The obtained sequences were checked for chimera formation using Pintail (Ashelford et al., 2005) . Sequences sharing X98% pairwise sequence identity were assigned to the same phylotype, and the nearest relative of each phylotype was retrieved from NCBI using the BLAST tool. The accession numbers of the obtained sequences deposited in GenBank were from JQ245511-JQ245695. Genomic DNA in sediments from 3, 13, 23 and 31 cm of core c3 was obtained through phenol-chloroform extraction, and amplified using the Illustra Genomiphi V2 DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). A total of 5 mg of the amplified DNA was sent to the Mission Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan) for high throughput pyrosequencing by a Roche 454 Genome Sequencer Titanium System (Roche/454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA). The sequences were assembled with 99% identity in the overlapping region (40 bases) using the manufacturer's assembler. To compare the numbers of key functional genes, R (v.2.10.1; RDC Team, 2008) and the built-in statistic package were used to perform a clustering analysis. Genes subject to further analyses include apr (encoding adenosine-5 0 -phosphosulfate reductase), dsr (encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase), mcr (encoding methyl coenzyme M reductase) and mmo/pmo (encoding soluble and particulate methane monooxygenase). The read counts of each gene from different depths were calculated and standardized by the Z-score method (Supplementary Information). Sequences obtained in this study were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive with the accession numbers of SRR389126 (31 cm), SRR389127 (23 cm), SRR389128 (13 cm) and SRR389129 (3 cm). Incubation experiment Sediments (5 ml or 8-10 g) collected by cutoff syringes were inoculated into serum bottles (59 ml) containing the designated medium adjusted to the local salinity (20 ml; ingredients include 5.8 g NaCl, 2) and flushed with pure argon for 2 min on site. The mineral solution was supplied with 10 mM sulfate for sulfate reduction or sulfate-dependent AOM, 5 mM acetate for acetoclastic methanogenesis and 5 mM methanol and methylamine each for methylotrophic methanogenesis. Bicarbonate at a final concentration of 10 mM was supplied for aerobic methanotrophy. Specific gases were provided for target metabolisms back in the laboratory. For aerobic methane oxidation, the headspace was flushed with air with a total volume five times the headspace volume (B35 ml), and provided with 3 ml 100% methane (equivalent to B8200 Pa). For sulfate reduction, and acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis, the headspace gas was replaced with pure nitrogen. For hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, the headspace gas was replaced with a gas mixture of 90% H 2 and 10% CO 2 . Samples for AOM were flushed with pure nitrogen first, and supplied with 5 ml 13 C-labeled methane (equivalent to B13 000 Pa). The incubations were performed at room temperature (B25 1C) in the dark. Methane, sulfate and 13 CO 2 were monitored for methanogenesis/aerobic methanotrophy, sulfate reduction and AOM through time, respectively. The accumulated yields of methane in the methanogenic incubations were further plotted against time to derive the initial methane production rate (within 3 days) used to constrain the maximum in situ methanogenic activity. Quantification of consumption and production rates of sulfate and methane The general diagenetic equation for reactive transport was used to model the solute transport and microbial reaction rate in the sediment column: where C i is the solute species i of interest, t is the time, z is the depth, j is the porosity, D sed is the diffusivity corrected for tortuosity, v is the advection rate, and R is the net reaction rate. Concentration and porosity data used in the modeling were adopted from the measurements. The correction of diffusivity for tortuosity followed the empirical relationships reported previously (Wang et al., 2008b) . The modeling further assumed that sedimentation and compaction rates were zero and a steady state was reached within a definitive time scale so the term @C i /@t was zero. The programs (NRR1 and NRR2) developed by Wang et al. (2008b) were employed to derive the predicted concentrations and net reaction rates for sulfate and methane. Given that chloride is soluble and inert to most abiotic and biological reactions in ambient environments, the reaction term (R i ) for chloride in the general diagenetic equation could be omitted. The chloride profile was then used to compute the advection rate. Integration over diffusion and advection terms demonstrated that chloride varied exponentially with depth. The best fit to the observed chloride profile required fluid advection at a rate of 0.10±0.03 m per year. However, the profile predicted simply by diffusion and advection transport could not replicate the observed chloride concentrations at shallow depths. This is most likely because evaporation at the surface and shallow depths enhances solute concentrations. The net reaction rates for sulfate and methane were further calculated using the advection rate of 0.1 m per year.  The bubbling fluid with a temperature of 23.6 1C was alkaline (pH 8.36), reducing (E h -340 mV), moderately saline (B110 mM chloride) and low in sulfate (o30 mM; Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). Sulfate (8.6-249 mM) and chloride (100-138 mM) concentrations in the surface fluids along an outflow channel were variable. The d 18 O values of the bubbling and surface fluids spanned from 6.3 to 7.5% (Figure 1 ), a range greater than those of local meteoric water and similar to those of the bubbling fluids collected from other MVs in southwestern Taiwan (Supplementary Figure S2) . Methane concentrations in the bubbling fluids ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 mM (roughly equivalent to 50-64% partial pressure of methane in the gas phase). The d 13 C values of methane in the bubbling fluid were around -34.5% (Supplementary Table S1 ). Ethane and propane concentrations in the bubbling fluids were from 28 to 31 mM and from 8.6 to 9.3 mM, respectively. Pilot analyses of pore water samples collected in 2007 showed that sulfate and chloride concentrations decreased with depth ( Figure 2 ). Although sulfate was nearly depleted below 9 cm, chloride concentrations decreased from 161 mM at the top to 100 mM at 38 cm. In contrast, methane concentrations increased with depth and peaked at 32 cm (20 mM). These data showing a sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) at 9-20 cm prompted detailed geochemical analyses of samples collected in 2009. Chloride and sulfate profiles in 2009 (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S2 ) exhibited a pattern similar to those in 2007. Chloride concentrations gradually decreased with depth. Sulfate concentrations decreased from 4.1 mM at the top to o10 mM at depths below 10 cm. The depletion of sulfate was accompanied with an increase of methane. Below B20 cm, the methane concentrations varied substantially between 1.29 and 2.14 mM. The d C values of methane decreased from -39% at the top to -48% at the deepest interval. Ethane concentrations remained at a nearly constant level over most depth intervals, whereas propane concentrations decreased with depth. Both ethane and propane concentrations were one to two orders of magnitude less than those of methane. Although alkalinity decreased with depth, the d 13 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon exhibited a U-shaped profile with the lowest value of 4.3% at the SMTZ and the high values of 7.1-7.3% at the deepest and top intervals. Compositions of 16 S rRNA gene A total of 402 archaeal and 668 bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone sequences were obtained from the bubbling fluid and sediments, and clustered into 36 and 149 phylotypes (98% similarity cutoff), respectively (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Of the archaeal members, 460% of any individual library comprised sequences affiliated with methanogens ( Figure 4 ). The majority of methanogens related to these sequences switched from Methanosarcinales (Methanosaeta-and Methanolobus-related strains) at p7 cm to Methanomicrobiales (Methanoculleus-and Carbon-sulfur cycling in a terrestrial mud volcano T-W Cheng et al Methanocalculus-related strains) at X11 cm. Some archaeal sequences (1-9%) in the bubbling fluid and at 7 cm were affiliated with the ANME-1 group. Bacterial community assemblages varied substantially among samples (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Phylum-based categorization indicated that the decrease in Cyanobacteria and GammaProteobacteria was accompanied with an increase in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the depth increased. The dominant sequences (410% of each clone library) were affiliated with hydrocarbondegrading Syntrophorhabdus sp. (Qiu et al., 2008) and Alcanivorax sp. (Wang et al., 2008a) , heterotrophic Marinobacter sp. (Zhang et al., 2002) , Tindallida sp. (Alazard et al., 2007) , Pseudomonas sp., Clostridium sp. (Shiratori et al., 2009) and Alkaliflexus imshenetskii (Zhilina et al., 2004) , mixotrophic Hydrogenophaga sp. (Kämpfer et al., 2005) and uncultured Bacteroidetes. Sequences affiliated with sulfate reducing Desulfobacterales , Desulfonatronum sp. (Zhilina et al., 2005) , and Desulfovibrio sp. (Abildgaard et al., 2006) , and sulfur oxidizing Thiomicrospira sp. (Brinkhoff and Muyzer, 1997) and Thioalkalispira sp. (Sorokin et al., 2002) were also detected in the sediments (Figure 4 ). Despite variations in sediment community assemblage, sequences affiliated with thermophilic Thermococcus mexicalis (Lepage et al., 2004) , Methanosaeta thermophila (Kamagata et al., 1992) , Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum (Imachi et al., 2002) and Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstoni (Henry et al., 1994) were either exclusively present or more abundant in the bubbling fluid. Metagenome data with a total of 495 960, 488 597, 335 045 and 511 350 reads were obtained from sediments at 3, 13, 23 and 31 cm, respectively (Supplementary Table S4 ). The summed read length was roughly equivalent to a total of 583 Mbps. Abundances of the genes mmo/pmo, apr and dsr at 3 and 13 cm were greater than those at 23 and 31 cm ( Figure 5 ). In contrast, abundance of the gene mcr peaked at 23 cm, was maintained at a moderate level at 3 and 13 cm, and decreased to a low level at 31 cm. Methane was produced in incubations supplied with methanogenic precursors (H 2 /CO 2 , acetate and methanol/methylamine) for sediments collected from all investigated depth intervals. The initial methanogenic rates for the incubations supplied with methylamine/methanol ranged between 2 to 4 nmol h ) occurring at 20-30 cm, whereas those with H 2 /CO 2 exhibited two peak zones near the SMTZ and at 25 cm. Methane was aerobically consumed in incubations of sediments from all investigated depth intervals. Initial methane in headspace (B8 Â 10 4 p.p.m.v.) was reduced to a level below 500 p.p.m.v. within 2 weeks for sediments from nearly all investigated depth intervals (except for sediments at 25 cm). As the headspace was episodically supplied with air during incubation and the internal pressure was not monitored, methane consumption rate could not be precisely calculated. Sulfate reduction was slow in sulfate-supplied incubations of sediments from all investigated depth intervals. The addition of a mixture of yeast extract, peptone and trypton stimulated the sulfate consumption rate with added sulfate reduced to a level below 0.01 mM in 2 weeks. Incubations of sediments supplied with 13 C-labeled methane and sulfate did not result in the detectable production of 13 Cenriched CO 2 over a period of 6 months. The reactive-transport modeling demonstrated that the net production of sulfate occurred at a rate of 5.38 mM per year within the top 6 cm. The net consumption of sulfate proceeded at a rate of Carbon-sulfur cycling in a terrestrial mud volcano T-W Cheng et al 2.16 mM per year at 6-14 cm (Supplementary Figure  S3) and decreased from 0.49 mM per year at 14-22 cm to nearly zero at depths further below. The integrated rate fluxes of sulfate production (or sulfide oxidation) at the top 6 cm and sulfate reduction across the SMTZ were 3.16 Â 10 À 1 and 1.78 Â 10 À 1 mol m À 2 per year, respectively. For comparison, the net methane consumption occurred at a rate of 0.82 mM per year or an integrated rate flux of 1.10 Â 10 À 1 mol m À 2 per year at p14 cm. The net methane production occurred at a rate of 0.79 mM per year or an integrated rate flux of 1.34 Â 10 À 1 mol m À 2 per year at X14 cm. If the transition from the net sulfate production to the net sulfate consumption is assumed to be the oxic-anoxic boundary, the integrated rate flux of aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophy would be 4.33 Â 10 À 2 and 6.66 Â 10 À 2 mol m À 2 per year, respectively. Fluid transport and surface alteration Fluids expelled from MVs are generally considered to rapidly migrate along the fracture tapping into deep geological structures or reservoirs. Fluids and sediments released are subsequently deposited in the peripheral mud platform or drained toward the topographic depression, and subject to the alteration of surface processes. Therefore, fluids collected from mud pools or localized bubbling features could potentially constrain the compositions of deeply sourced fluid and surface processes. In this study, chloride conserved to microbial and most abiotic processes was first used as a tracer of fluid process. The chloride concentration in the top pore water was 1.6-1.9 times greater than that in the bubbling fluid. Such an enrichment of chloride concentration is best explained by surface evaporation. In addition, the isotopic compositions of fluids collected from the SYNHMV (Figure 1) and MVs in the adjacent areas (Supplementary Figure S1 ) deviated from the local meteoric water line at various degrees (Supplementary Figure S2) , suggesting that these fluids are subject to the long-term water-rock interaction and surface evaporation (Wang et al., 2001) . The interpretation of surface evaporation based on chloride concentrations and isotopic compositions are mutually consistent with each other. Second, the chloride concentration in the bottom pore water was comparable to that in the bubbling fluid (Figures 2a and 3a) , suggesting that deeply sourced fluids are relatively less saline (100-120 mM chloride), and the variation of chloride in pore water could be attributed to the mixing between the deeply sourced, dilute component and the surface, saline component. Third, the enrichment of chloride in the top pore water was much less than that of sulfate (1.6 and 9.2 times for chloride and sulfate, respectively, in core c1; 1.9 and 276 times for chloride and sulfate, respectively, in core c2), suggesting that an additional sulfur source is required to enhance the sulfate concentration. The oxidation of fine-grained sulfide minerals (such as pyrite and greigite), previously identified in the host geological formation (Horng and Roberts, 2006) , appears to be the most plausible mechanism to account for the elevated sulfate concentration at the top interval. Whether this mineral oxidation is mediated by abiotic or microbial processes remains uncertain. The sulfate produced from evaporative condensation of solute and mineral oxidation is vital for microbial sulfate reduction at depth. Finally, the magnitude of sulfate depletion in pore water was much greater than that of chloride (Figures 2 and 3) . The concentration profiles for compounds susceptible to microbial metabolisms could be readily distinguished from those controlled purely by abiotic processes. The geochemical results obtained in this study reveal a stratified metabolic zonation pattern. Sulfate concentrations decreased from 40.8 mM at the top to being nearly exhausted at B10 cm in both cores c1 and c2 (Figures 2 and 3) . The decrease of sulfate was accompanied with the increase of methane with depth, marking a SMTZ. Like those observed in marine settings (Borowski et al., 1997; Treude et al., 2005) , the observed SMTZ and geochemical profiles suggest active sulfate reduction, AOM and methanogenesis. The interpretation of the observed profiles is further supported by the decreasing d 13 C values of methane with depth, the relative depletion of 13 C in methane in the (Figures 2 and 3) . The difference in sulfate abundance could be accounted for by the duration of surface exposure of sediments to the atmosphere, the discharge frequency and magnitude of fluids and sediments, and the dilution caused by precipitation. Similarly, methane concentrations varied substantially within the methane-rich zone regardless of the cores analyzed, suggesting that methanogenesis is timeand depth-dependent, and heterogeneously distributed within the pore space. Overall, surface processes and microbial activities exert a profound effect on the enrichment of sulfate in the top pore water and methane in the methanerich zones. Despite that the exact magnitude of variation in sulfate or methane abundance and the depth of SMTZ change temporarily, the metabolic stratification is persistently maintained at the SYNHMV. This is in contrast with the iron/manganese-methane transition signifying the metal-dependent AOM in a MV of eastern Taiwan (Chang et al., 2012) and exhibits great similarities with those commonly observed in marine counterparts. The presence of such a geochemical pattern and metabolic stratification seems to link to the strong depthdependent regulation imposed by the interactions between surface processes and subsurface fluid transport. The metabolic stratification inferred from geochemical profiles is consistent with the relative abundances of functional genes retrieved from the metagenome data and with the inference of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the clone libraries. First, the abundances of reads matching the mmo/pmo and apr gene sequences decreased significantly with depth ( Figure 5 ). In addition, abundant Alcanivorax-, Cyanobacteria-, Hydrogenophaga-, Marinobacter-and Pseudomonas-related 16S rRNA gene sequences were detected at 1 and 7 cm (Figure 4) , and methane was aerobically consumed in all incubations. The gene mmo/pmo accounts for aerobic methane oxidation, whereas the gene apr represents the reversible conversion between sulfite and sulfate during either dissimilatory sulfate reduction or the oxidation of elemental sulfur or sulfide. Therefore, the enhanced abundance of these two genes at shallow depths together with the presence of sequences affiliated with oxygenic phototrophs and aerobic heterotrophs suggests that oxygen requiring microorganisms must proliferate above the transition zone where atmospheric oxygen could penetrate. Although the exact depth of oxygen penetration is not determined, the oxygen infiltrated from the atmosphere and produced by cyanobacteria would be transiently depleted by aerobic methanotrophy and/or heterotrophy, favoring the proliferation of anaerobes at depth. In contrast, the presence of the genes dsr and mcr indicates the capability for anaerobic sulfate reduction and methanotrophy/methanogenesis, respectively. The observed relative abundances of the genes, dsr and mcr, exhibit inverse depth-dependent trends to each other ( Figure 5 ), a pattern consistent with the geochemical interpretation that sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are primarily confined at the shallow depths and within the methanerich zone, respectively. The metagenome data is also in part corroborated with the detection of 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with Desulfobacterales and Desulfovibrionales within Delta-Proteobacteria, ANME-1 members, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinales (Figure 4) , and with the active sulfate reduction and methane production in the incubations. Finally, to compare the communities from individual samples, the UniFrac program (Lozupone and Knight, 2005) with the Cluster Environments algorithm for the abundance-weighted phylotypes was employed. The bacterial and archaeal communities at depths above and below the SMTZ formed distinct clusters (Figure 7 ). The transition of both archaeal and bacterial communities at the SMTZ is consistent with the metabolic stratification inferred from the metagenome data. Such a community relationship supports the assertion that stratified microbial functions and community structures are strongly regulated by the geochemical context imposed by the interactions between surface processes and subsurface fluid transport. The UniFrac analysis also indicated that the community assemblage in the bubbling fluid was distinct from those associated with the sediments (Figure 7 ). This combined with the observation that some sequences affiliated with thermophiles were either exclusively present or more abundant in the bubbling fluid suggests that a portion of community members might be derived from a deep source at high temperatures. The exposure of sediment to the atmosphere during the fluid discharge and sediment deposition would limit the survival of these indigenous thermophilic members, whereas rendering the proliferation of mesophiles potentially capable of adapting to the oxidative stress. The majority of methanogen-related 16S rRNA gene sequences were related to Methanosarcinales (Methanosaeta-and Methanolobus-related strains; dominating at p7 cm) and Methanomicrobiales (Methanoculleus-and Methanocalculus-related strains; dominating at X11 cm; Figure 4 ). Methanolobus obligatorily utilizes non-competitive methyl compounds produced from the fermentation of osmoprotectants (such as glycerol) in hypersaline or saline environments (Zinder, 1993; Whitman et al., 2006) . These methanogens could coexist with sulfate reducers without the need of substrate competition. Although the average chloride concentration in the top pore water does not exceed that of seawater, surface evaporation might lead to the local enhancement of salinity, thereby favoring the predominance of Methanolobus-related members at shallow depths. The activity of these methanogens would not be great, as methane is not substantially depleted in 13 C and methane concentrations are not enhanced at shallow depths. Methane produced in situ by these methanogens would be further consumed by aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophy. Below 10 cm, where sulfate was nearly exhausted, the Methanomicrobiales-related members outnumbered the other methanogens and likely produced methane through CO 2 reduction. Methanogenic activities at these depth intervals are apparently high as evidenced by the high methane levels, the depletion of 13 C in methane and the maximum initial rates for the incubation of sediments at 25 cm with H 2 /CO 2 (Figures 3 and 6) . The high methanogenic activity has to be tied to the fermentative production of H 2 through a syntrophic relationship by which hydrogenotrophic methanogens and hydrogen-producing fermenters maximize the efficiency of interspecies H 2 transfer (Ishii et al., 2005; Kimura et al., 2010) . These methanogens are most likely heterogeneously distributed within the methane-rich zone, thereby accounting for the fluctuating methane levels obtained from triplicate measurements. Although metabolic stratification at the SYNHMV resembles that in marine counterparts, the driving force that charges the deeply sourced, oxidantdepleted fluids with sufficient amounts of electron acceptor is quite different. As no sulfate-rich seawater overlies sediments, the intrusion of atmospheric oxygen fuels aerobic methane/sulfide oxidation and transforms sulfide minerals into sulfate (Supplementary Figure S5) . With the feedback of aerobic metabolisms, the dissolved oxygen would be transiently depleted to facilitate the colonization of anaerobes that harvest metabolic energy from either mineral-derived sulfate or organic carbon inherited in sediments. Methane flux generated by in situ methanogenesis appears to overprint the thermogenic methane migrating from deep sources quantitatively and isotopically, and to exceed the capacity of microbial consumption. Interpretations constrained by geochemical and molecular results demonstrate that tightly coupled carbon and sulfur cycles enable the link of deep crustal environments with surface microbial and abiotic processes in terrestrial MV ecosystems. Such surface-subsurface interactions would allow the creation of numerous micro-niches harboring various assemblages of specialized microorganisms modulated under specific geochemical contexts.

10441501,"Methanococcoides vulcani sp. nov., a marine methylotrophic methanogen that uses betaine, choline and N,N-dimethylethanolamine for methanogenesis, isolated from a mud volcano, and emended description of the genus Methanococcoides.","A novel, strictly anaerobic, methylotrophic marine methanogen, strain SLH33(T), was isolated from deep sediment samples covered by an orange microbial mat collected from the Napoli Mud Volcano. Cells of strain SLH33(T) were Gram-stain-negative, motile, irregular cocci that occurred singly. Cells utilized trimethylamine, dimethylamine, monomethylamine, methanol, betaine, N,N-dimethylethanolamine and choline (N,N,N-trimethylethanolamine) as substrates for growth and methanogenesis. The optimal growth temperature was 30 °C; maximum growth rate was obtained at pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.5 M Na(+). The DNA G+C content of strain SLH33(T) was 43.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed strain SLH33(T) within the genus Methanococcoides. The novel isolate was related most closely to Methanococcoides methylutens TMA-10(T) (98.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) but distantly related to Methanococcoides burtonii DSM 6242(T) (97.6%) and Methanococcoides alaskense AK-5(T) (97.6%). DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated that strain SLH33(T) represents a novel species, given that it shared less than 16% DNA-DNA relatedness with Methanococcoides methylutens TMA-10(T). The name Methanococcoides vulcani sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species, with strain SLH33(T) ( = DSM 26966(T) = JCM 19278(T)) as the type strain. An emended description of the genus Methanococcoides is also proposed.","singly. Cells utilized trimethylamine, dimethylamine, monomethylamine, methanol, betaine, N,Ndimethylethanolamine and choline (N,N,N-trimethylethanolamine) as substrates for growth and methanogenesis. The optimal growth temperature was 30 6C; maximum growth rate was obtained at pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.5 M Na Methanogens are divided into three metabolic groups based on substrates used: hydrogenotrophs use H 2 /CO 2 , acetoclasts use acetate and methylotrophs use methylated compounds (Garcia et al., 2000) . Generally, methanogenesis is limited in marine sediments when sulfate is present, because of the higher affinity of sulfate-reducing bacteria for hydrogen and acetate (Oremland & Taylor, 1978) . However, methanogenic Archaea have been detected in upper sediment layers, where the concentration of the sulfate is relatively high, using cultivation, molecular methods or in situ measurement (Lazar et al., 2011a, b) . The use of noncompetitive substrates consumed exclusively by methanogens could explain the occurrence of methanogens in the presence of relatively high concentrations of sulphate. C 1 compounds, such as methanol and methylated nitrogen [methylamine, dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA)] or sulfur compounds (methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide), could be utilized by some methanogens as substrate for growth and methanogenesis. The order Methanosarcinales is one of the seven orders of the methanogens, including a new lineage, Methanomassiliicoccales (Iino et al., 2013) (Kendall & Boone, 2006; Lomans et al., 1999; Sprenger et al., 2000; Yu & Kawamura, 1987) . The genus Methanococcoides comprises, at the time of writing, three recognized species, namely Methanococcoides methylutens, Methanococcoides burtonii and Methanococcoides alaskense. Methanococcoides methylutens was isolated from submarine canyon sediments off the coast of southern California (Sowers & Ferry, 1983) , Methanococcoides burtonii was obtained from the anoxic hypolimnion of Ace Lake in Antarctica (Franzmann et al., 1992) and Methanococcoides alaskense was isolated from permanently cold anoxic marine sediments at Skan Bay in Alaska (Singh et al., 2005) . In this study, we describe a novel strain isolated from deep marine sediment, closely related to Methanococcoides methylutens. Sediment samples were collected in the Napoli Mud Volcano in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the Ifremer Medeco cruise with the research vessel Pourquoi Pas? in October and November 2007. Sediment push-core CT-21 was recovered during dive PL 331-10 by the remotely operated vehicle VICTOR 6000 (Ifremer) at 1938 m water depth (33 u 43.43979 N 24 u 41.03859 E). In the sampled area, sediments were recovered with dense orange microbial mats on top of the core. The sediment push-core sample contained bacterial orange filaments that penetrated the first 2-3 cm. Immediately after retrieval, the sediment core (10 cm long) was sectioned aseptically in 2 cm thick layers in the cooling room (4 uC). Subsamples were transferred to 50 ml glass vials closed tightly with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco), pressurized with N 2 (100 kPa), reduced with sodium sulfide and stored at 4 uC until processed further. Enrichment, isolation and cultivation of methylotrophic methanogens were performed in medium containing (per litre distilled water): 30 g NaCl, 4 g MgCl 2 . 6H 2 O, 3.45 g MgSO 4 . 7H 2 O, 0.25 g NH 4 Cl, 0.33 g KCl, 0.14 g CaCl 2 . 2H 2 O, 10 ml trace element mixture (medium 141; DSMZ), 0.2 g yeast extract, 1 g NaHCO 3 , 0.14 g K 2 HPO 4 and 1 mg resazurin. The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 7 with HCl. The medium was boiled under nitrogen, cooled under nitrogen and 0.5 g cysteine hydrochloride added. The medium was autoclaved, and then supplemented with 10 ml vitamin mixture (medium 141). Enrichments were performed anaerobically in 50 ml vials with 20 mM TMA. Enrichments were incubated at 15 u C for up to 1 year. Positive enrichments, i.e. cocci that fluoresced blue-green when examined with a UV-fluorescence microscope, were subcultured and purified by streaking onto the same medium solidified with 15 g Nobel agar l . Plates were incubated in anaerobic jars at 20 u C for 1 month. Purity of the isolate was confirmed by microscopic observations and subcultivation into rich media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Stock cultures were stored at 280 u C with 5 % (v/v) DMSO. Unless otherwise stated, all phenotypic tests were performed at 20 u C using the medium described above, at pH 7 with 30 g NaCl l . Cell morphology and motility were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (JEM 100 CX II; JEOL) during the exponential growth phase. Transmission electron microscopy observations were performed after negative staining with uranyl acetate (2 %, v/v). The growth temperature range of the strain was examined between 5 and 40 u C (5 u C increments) by measuring the turbidity (600 nm) using a spectrophotometer (Genesys 20; ThermoScientific) of cultures incubated in Bellco tubes. The pH range for growth was examined at 20 u C in the same medium with 20 mM MES, PIPES, HEPES or Tris over a range from pH 5.5 to 9.0. The effect of NaCl on growth was determined in the same medium with between 0 and 8 % (w/v) NaCl (increments of 0.5 %). Cell numbers were determined by direct cell counting using a flow cytometer (CyFlow Space; Partec). Growth rates were calculated using linear regression analysis from four to seven points along the logarithmic portion of the resulting growth curves. The catabolic growth range of the strain was determined in optimal conditions by adding (in separate tests) 80 mM formate, 40 mM acetate, 40 mM methanol, 20 mM TMA, 20 mM DMA, 20 mM monomethylamine (MMA), 5 mM dimethylsulfide (DMS), 6 mM betaine, 6 mM choline and 6 mM N,N-dimethylethanolamine. The ability to utilize methanol (40 mM) and hydrogen (100 %, 100 kPa) was tested in standard culture conditions. Autotrophic growth was tested in medium buffered with NaHCO 3 , and H 2 /CO 2 (80 : 20; 200 kPa) was used as the gas phase. Stimulating compounds were tested under optimal growth conditions with TMA as the catabolic substrate. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain SLH33 T was determined by the Identification Service of the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) by HPLC analysis of DNAs as described by Mesbah et al. (1989) . The G+C content of strain SLH33 T was 43.4 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments were performed to further elucidate the level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain SLH33 T and Methanococcoides methylutens TMA-10 T . They were performed by the Identification Service of the DSMZ, as described by De Ley et al. (1970) , with the modifications described by Huß et al. (1983) , using a Cary 100 Bio UV/VIS-spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostated 666 multicell changer and a temperature controller with in situ temperature probe (Varian). Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from purified DNA extracts using the archaeal targeted primer pair 8F (59-CGGTTGATCCTGCCGGA-39) and 1492R (59-GGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-39) (Teske et al., 2002) . The PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced by Beckman Coulter Genomics using four primers (M13F, 59-AGAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-39; M13R, 59-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-39; 344F, 59-AGGGTTGCGC-TCGTTG-39; and 907R, 59-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-39). The mcrA genes were amplified using primers ME1 (59-GCMATGCARATHGGWATGTC-39) and ME2 (59-TCA-TKGCRTAGTTDGGRTAGT-39) (Hales et al., 1996) . The PCR conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 u C for 40 s, annealing at 50 u C for 90 s and extension at 72 u C for 3 min. The PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced by Beckman Coulter Genomics using forward primer M13F and reverse primer M13R. The 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained in this study were imported into version 111 of the Silva database (Pruesse et al., 2007;  http://www.arb-silva.de) using the ARB software package (Ludwig et al., 2004) . Sequences from other studies that were not included in Silva were retrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The sequences were automatically aligned against the entire database by using the 'Integrated Aligner' of ARB, and the alignments were refined manually. The final consensus sequence was assembled from three independent sequences from each primer used. Positions that had not been sequenced in one or more reference organisms were omitted. Phylogenetic trees of almost full-length sequences (1306 nt) were reconstructed using RaxML, a maximum-likelihood method (Stamatakis, 2006 ) with rate distribution model GTRMIX and a weighting mask based on positional variability of archaeal reference sequences calculated by parsimony. The outgroup-rooted (Methanopyrus kandleri) phylogenetic tree topology and node support (100 bootstraps) were tested. The mcrA gene sequences were imported into a seed alignment. The mcrA gene sequences were then translated into amino acid sequences and aligned using CLUSTAL X (Larkin et al., 2007) . Trees were calculated at the amino acid level (153 aa) using a neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987 ) with a Poisson correction implanted in the MEGA4.0.2 program (Tamura et al., 2007) . The outgrouprooted (Methanopyrus kandleri) phylogenetic tree topology and node support (1000 bootstraps) were tested. After the third streaking on a plate, a single yellow colony of 1-2 mm in diameter was picked and transferred back into liquid medium. This was designated strain SLH33 T . T were irregular cocci, occurred singly, were autofluorescent and exhibited a slight tumbling motility with one to four polar flagella (Fig. S1 , available in the online Supplementary Material). Cells of strain SLH33 T were irregular cocci with a mean diameter about 0.6-1.7 mm. Cells stained Gram-negative. The cells were lysed by SDS, indicating a proteinaceous cell wall. The strain grew in media with an Na + concentration of 0.25-1 M with no growth at 0.17 or 1.2 M. Optimum growth was at 0.5 M Na + . The pH range for growth was pH 6.0-7.8. No growth was detected at pH 5.5 or 8.0, and optimum pH was about 7.0. The optimum temperature for growth was 30 u C, and no growth was observed at 37 u C. Growth was observed at 4 u C, but the minimal temperature for growth was not determined (Fig. S2 ). Growth and methanogenesis were supported by the methylotrophic substrates TMA, DMA, MMA, methanol, betaine, choline and N,N-dimethylethanolamine. No growth was observed on DMS, formate, acetate or H 2 /CO 2 . Hydrogen was not used when reducing methanol. When supplemented individually in the basal medium vitamin mixture (medium 141), yeast extract (0.02 %), peptone, tryptone and Casamino acids stimulated the growth yield. Under optimal growth conditions, the doubling time of strain SLH33 T was around 21 h. To test the phylogenetic position of strain SLH33, we added the 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences to a comprehensive set of sequences from public databases. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, the closest neighbours of strain SLH33 T were Methanococcoides strains (97.7-99.6 % similarity). The highest similarity was observed with Methanococcoides sp. strain NM1 (Watkins et al., 2012) and Methanococcoides methylutens TMA-10 T , the latter being closest reference strain (98.8 % similarity) representing a species with a validly published name. A phylogenetic tree based on the maximum-likelihood method for strain SLH33 T and four other Methanococcoides strains is shown in Fig. 1 . Strain SLH33 T fell into the phylogenetic cluster of the genus Methanococcoides. Clustering was supported by high bootstrap values. Phylogenetic analysis based on mcrA gene sequences confirmed that strain SLH33 T was a member of the genus Methanococcoides, in good agreement with the results of the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis (Fig. 1) . The mcrA gene sequence of strain SLH33 T fell within the genus Methanococcoides containing sequences from marine or similar habitats and was related most closely to Methanococcoides sp. strain NM1 isolated from Napoli Mud Volcano sediments (Watkins et al., 2012) . The topologies of the 16S rRNA and mcrA gene trees resembled each other strongly (Fig. 1) . The topologies of the trees were also checked with alternative methods (parsimony) and appear to be the same (data not shown). experiments to test the genomic uniqueness of a novel isolate at a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity range of 98.7-99 %. Thus, the level of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain SLH33 T and Methanococcoides methylutens TMA-10 T (98.8 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) was low (,16 %), far below the threshold value of 70 % DNA-DNA relatedness generally accepted for the definition of a novel species (Wayne et al., 1987) . Based on the data presented, strain SLH33 T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Methanococcoides, for which the name Methanococcoides vulcani sp. nov. is proposed. Previously described species of the genus Methanococcoides have been isolated from coastal areas and Ace Lake. A description of the first organism belonging to this genus that has been isolated from a deep-sea environment is given here. The distinctive features between the novel isolate and recognized species of the genus Methanococcoides are given in Table 1 . This distinctiveness was confirmed by random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting between the novel isolate and validated species of the genus (Fig. S3) . The description is as given by Sowers (2000) with the following amendments. Cells are irregular cocci, occurring singly or in pairs; about 1 mm in diameter. The cell wall consists of a very thin protein monolayer approximately 10 nm thick. Susceptible to lysis by hypotonic or detergent shock. Mesophilic. Strictly anaerobic. Neutrophilic. Halophilic, growth between 0.08 and 1.1 M of NaCl. Cells can dismutate methylamines, methanol, betaine, choline and N,N-dimethylethanolamine for growth but cannot catabolize acetate, DMS, H 2 /CO 2 or formate. Description of Methanococcoides vulcani sp. nov. Methanococcoides vulcani (vul.ca9ni. L. gen. n. vulcani of Vulcanus, the Roman god of fire; relating to the place of isolation from Napoli Mud Volcano). Cells exhibit a slight tumbling motility by means of one to four polar flagella. They are irregular cocci (diameter 0.6-1.7 mm) and occur singly. Colonies are yellow, circular and convex. Cells exhibit a specific F 420 blue autofluorescence under UV illumination. TMA, DMA, MMA betaine, choline, N,N-dimethylethanolamine and methanol serve as catabolite substrates with methane as the product. DMS, formate, acetate and hydrogen are not used as catabolic substrates. Hydrogen is not used with methanol. Growth is stimulated by vitamins, yeast extract, peptone, tryptone and Casamino acids. Fastest growth occurs at 30 u C, at a salinity of 0.5 M Na + and at pH 7.0. Doubling time under optimal conditions is 21 h. The type strain, SLH33 T (5DSM 26966 T 5JCM 19278 T ), was isolated from sediment in Napoli Mud Volcano covered by a dense orange microbial mat at 1938 m water depth.

13438555,Diversity and Abundance of Aerobic and Anaerobic Methane Oxidizers,"Submarine mud volcanoes are formed by expulsions of mud, fluids, and gases from deeply buried subsurface sources. They are highly reduced benthic habitats and often associated with intensive methane seepage. In this study, the microbial diversity and community structure in methane-rich sediments of the Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) were investigated by comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the active volcano center, which has a diameter of about 500 m, the main methane-consuming process was bacterial aerobic oxidation. In this zone, aerobic methanotrophs belonging to three bacterial clades closely affiliated with Methylobacter and Methylophaga species accounted for 56%+/-8% of total cells. In sediments below Beggiatoa mats encircling the center of the HMMV, methanotrophic archaea of the ANME-3 clade dominated the zone of anaerobic methane oxidation. ANME-3 archaea form cell aggregates mostly associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Desulfobulbus (DBB) branch. These ANME-3/DBB aggregates were highly abundant and accounted for up to 94%+/-2% of total microbial biomass at 2 to 3 cm below the surface. ANME-3/DBB aggregates could be further enriched by flow cytometry to identify their phylogenetic relationships. At the outer rim of the mud volcano, the seafloor was colonized by tubeworms (Siboglinidae, formerly known as Pogonophora). Here, both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidizers were found, however, in lower abundances. The level of microbial diversity at this site was higher than that at the central and Beggiatoa species-covered part of the HMMV. Analysis of methyl-coenzyme M-reductase alpha subunit (mcrA) genes showed a strong dominance of a novel lineage, mcrA group f, which could be assigned to ANME-3 archaea. Our results further support the hypothesis of Niemann et al. (54), that high methane availability and different fluid flow regimens at the HMMV provide distinct niches for aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs.","Large amounts of methane are stored in the subsurface ocean as crystalline gas hydrate, dissolved in porewater, and as free gas. Most of the methane which rises from subsurface reservoirs is consumed by anaerobic microorganisms inhabiting sulfate-penetrated sediment layers before it reaches the seafloor (65) . This microbially mediated anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) controls the emission of the greenhouse gas methane from the ocean to the atmosphere (see reference 23 and references therein). In marine habitats, the metabolic process of AOM is proposed to be a reversed methanogenesis coupled to the reduction of sulfate involving methanotrophic archaea (ANME archaea) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). ANME archaea and SRB are assumed to interact syntrophically (26) and form microbial consortia which oxidize methane with equimolar amounts of sulfate, yielding bicarbonate and sulfide (26, 51, 52) . Sulfide produced as a by-product of AOM at cold seeps often supports chemosynthetic communities which derive energy from sulfide oxidation. Three archaeal clades (ANME-1, ANME-2, and ANME-3) oxidize methane under anoxic marine conditions (5, 54, 58, 59) . ANME-1 archaea, distantly related to Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales, occur in sediments mostly as single cells (35, 53, 58) but also aggregated (56, 59) or associated with SRB in microbial mats (mat-type consortia [35, 46] ). ANME-2 archaea belong to the order Methanosarcinales and are usually associated with SRB of the Desulfosarcina-Desulfococcus (DSS) branch, forming structured consortia (shell-type and mixed-type ANME-2/DSS aggregates [5, 35] ). Very recently, we identified ANME-3 archaea related to the genera Methanococcoides and Methanolobus which live syntrophically with SRB of the Desulfobulbus (DBB) branch (ANME-3/DBB aggregates) (54) . Today, neither members of the ANME groups nor their sulfate-reducing bacterial partners have been obtained in pure culture. The enzymes and biochemical pathways of AOM remain largely unknown. However, recent metagenomic studies have identified a modified methyl-coenzyme M-reductase (""methanase"") which may catalyze the activation of methane under anoxic conditions (20, 21, 36) . In contrast to AOM, the microbially mediated aerobic oxidation of methane appears to be only a minor biological sink of methane in the ocean. Most known aerobic methanotrophs belong to the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and depend on the availability of oxygen (22) . Hence, in marine habitats aerobic methanotrophs are restricted to the oxic water column and sediment-water interface or exist as symbionts of mussels, clams, and tubeworms. This study provides for the first time a detailed quantitative analysis of the composition and distribution of methanotrophic guilds at an active methane-seeping mud volcano. The Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) is a submarine mud volcano and is the only one in a polar region which has been studied in great detail (8, 16, 18, 25, 38, 47, 61, 62, 68, 80, 81) . Very recently, we showed that the HMMV hosts three key microbial communities ( Fig. 1 ): aerobic methanotrophic bacteria at the volcano center, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea of the ANME-2 group below siboglinid tubeworms, and the new clade of ANME-3 archaea associated with Beggiatoa mats (54) . These populations are highly influenced by the upward flow of sulfate-and oxygen-free fluids which restrict the availability of these electron acceptors for methane oxidation. The biogeochemistry of the HMMV is discussed in detail by De Beer et al. (9) and Niemann et al. (54) . In this study, we further investigated the diversity and distribution of methanotrophic guilds at the HMMV and present detailed phylogenetic, microscopic, and quantitative analysis of the novel ANME-3 consortia as well as other bacteria and archaea at the HMMV. Furthermore, we analyzed the diversity of genes encoding the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M-reductase (mcrA), which is the key enzyme of methanogenesis and identified a new lineage of mcrA. This mcrA type could be retrieved from sorted ANME-3 aggregates and thereby assigned to ANME-3 archaea. Site description and sample collection. The HMMV is an active cold seep situated at the Norwegian-Barents-Spitzbergen continental margin (72°00.25ЈN, 14°43.50ЈE) in a water depth of 1,250 m. Sediment samples were collected in August 2001 and June/July 2003 during joint cruises of the Alfred Wegener Institute and IFREMER with research vessels L'Atalante and Polarstern, respectively, and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) VICTOR 6000 (IFREMER) in the framework of a German/French collaborative program (33) . During dives with VICTOR 6000, signs of recent mud expulsion were observed in the northern part of the HMMV. The center is a flat circular area of about 500 m in diameter (0.11 km 2 ). It is encircled by sulfidic sediments covered with dense Beggiatoa mats in a stretch of about 40 to 120 m width (0.22 km 2 ). The outer rim of HMMV is composed of hill and trench sections, elevated about 1 to 8 m higher than the center, and covered by dense accumulations of thread-like tubeworms (Siboglinidae) for a zone of 60 to 200 m (0.41 km 2 ). The two dominant species have been identified as Sclerolinum contortum and Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis (70) . The tubes of the worms have a diameter of a few millimeters and reach lengths of up to 60 cm. Only a small part of the tube extends up to 5 cm into the water column, and the main part is buried in the sediments. Siboglinid tubeworms are known to harbor endosymbionts, which can be either thiotrophic or methanotrophic (66, 72) . Sediment samples were recovered by video-guided multiple corer (MUC) or ROV-operated push cores at different zones of HMMV as follows: two cores as replicates from center sediments (station ATL25, dive 5, site A, 72°00.22ЈN, 14°43.50ЈE; station PS64-312, MUC core, 72°00.25ЈN, 14°43.49ЈE), three cores as replicates from the Beggiatoa mat site (station ATL19, dive 4, 72°00.19ЈN, 14°43.67Ј; station PS317-2, dive 219, PC14/17, 72°00.16ЈN, 14°43.88ЈE; station PS322, MUC core, 72°00.18ЈN, 14°43.85ЈE), and three cores as replicates of sediments from the tubeworm field (station ATL22, MUC core, 72°00.08ЈN, 14°43.39ЈE; station PS64-326, dive 220, PC2, 72°00.06ЈN, 14°42.13ЈE; PS64-356, MUC core, 72°00.05ЈN, 14°44.18ЈE). The sediment biogeochemistries of the sampled sites are further described by De Beer et al. (9) and Niemann et al. (54) . DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and clone library construction. We constructed one bacterial and one archaeal 16S rRNA gene library from each habitat to gain first insights into the diversity. For DNA extraction, cores were sectioned in 1-cm-thick layers and frozen at Ϫ20°C. Total community DNA was directly extracted from 2 g of wet sediments (center station ATL25) and Beggiatoa mats VOL. 73, 2007 METHANE OXIDIZERS AT AN ARCTIC MUD VOLCANO 3349 (station ATL19) at 0-to 5-cm depths and from the tubeworm field (station ATL22) at 6-to 17-cm depths by using the method of Zhou et al. (85) . Crude DNA was purified with the Wizard DNA clean-up kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Domain-specific primers were used to amplify almost-full-length 16S rRNA genes from the extracted chromosomal DNAs by PCR: for Bacteria, primers GM3F (Escherichia coli 16S rRNA position 0008) (50) and EUB1492 (32) were used, and for Archaea, primers 20f (44) and Uni1392R (37) or 20f and Arch958R (10) were used. In addition to 16S rRNA genes, fragments of the gene coding for the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M-reductase (mcrA) were amplified using the primers ME1 and ME2 (19) . PCRs were performed and products purified as described previously (64 . Potential chimeras were eliminated before phylogenetic trees were constructed. Sequence data were analyzed with the ARB software package (41) . Phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA gene sequences were calculated by parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum-likelihood analysis with different sets of filters. For tree calculation, only almost-full-length sequences were considered. Partial sequences were inserted into the reconstructed tree by parsimony criteria without allowing changes in the overall tree topology. The phylogenetic tree of the protein-encoding gene mcrA was generated from deduced amino acid sequences by neighbor-joining analysis with a 30% amino acid frequency filter. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Subsamples of sediment cores were sliced into 1-cm intervals, fixed with formaldehyde, and treated by sonication as described previously (63) . Hybridization with monolabeled probes and microscopy counts of hybridized and DAPI (4Ј,6Ј-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained cells were performed as described previously (71) . In situ hybridizations with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled probes followed by tyramide signal amplification (also known as catalyzed reporter deposition [CARD]) were carried out as described by Pernthaler et al. (60) , except for cell wall permeabilization. For permeabilization of rigid archaeal cell walls, filters were incubated in 0.01 M HCl for 10 min at room temperature, subsequently incubated in 0.1 M HCl (1 min) or 1% Triton X-100 (10 min), and finally washed in MilliQ water and dehydrated in absolute ethanol. Hybridized samples were examined with an epifluorescence microscope (Axiophot II; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For each probe and sample, 700 to 1,000 DAPI-stained cells in 10 to 20 independent microscopic fields were counted. Micrographs of microbial aggregates were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Probes were purchased from biomers.net (Ulm, Germany). Probe sequences and formamide concentrations required for specific hybridization are given in Table 1 . The specificity of new probes was evaluated against reference strains having one or more mismatches. Sorting of ANME-3 aggregates by flow cytometry. For flow cytometric sorting, a fixed and sonicated subsample from an HMMV enrichment culture (culture conditions according to the method described in reference 51, incubated at 4°C) was hybridized in 800 l buffer containing 0.9 M sodium chloride, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% formamide (according to the ANME-3 probe requirements), 2.5 ng l Ϫ1 of Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probe ANME3-1249, and 1.25 ng l Ϫ1 of each helper probe (ANME-3-1249H3 and ANME-3-1249H5) at 46°C. After 4 h of incubation, hybridization was stopped by the addition of 3 ml of washing buffer containing 0.215 M sodium chloride, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). Cell sorting was done with a MoFlow flow cytometer (Cytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO) similar to the procedure described by Sekar et al. (67) . For the e Monolabeled probe ANME-3-1249 used together with unlabeled helper probes ANME-3-1249H3 and ANME-3-1249H5. f Non-group hit (zero mismatches): Methanohalobium evestigatum. excitation of Cy3-labeled cells, the laser was tuned to a wavelength of 514 nm (500 mW). Side-angle light scatter (SSC) was detected through a band-pass filter (530 Ϯ 20 nm; Cytomation). Orange fluorescence from hybridized cells was detected by using a band-pass filter (570 Ϯ 20 nm). The system threshold was set for SSC. The instrument was aligned by use of polychromatic 0.5-m calibration beads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Online analysis, sort control, and postanalysis were done with Summit software, version 3.1 (Cytomation). Probepositive cells were detected in a bivariant dot plot diagram of SSC versus Cy3. The instrument was sterilized by subsequent runs of 70% ethanol and autoclaved distilled water. It was kept under sterile conditions during sorting by use of an in-line filter (filter cartridge; pore size, 0.2 m; Pall, Ilfracombe, United Kingdom) and autoclaved sheath fluid. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes as well as mcrA genes were amplified by PCR directly from the sorted fraction using the primer combinations described above. Total cell counts and size measurements of ANME-3 aggregates. Total counts of individual cells were done by epifluorescence microscopy after staining with acridine orange according to the method of Meyer-Reil (45) . Aggregates were counted after in situ hybridization. Total cell counts were defined as the sums of the numbers of single cells and estimated numbers of aggregated cells present in ANME-3 consortia. Since single cells in an aggregate cannot be counted exactly, a semiquantitative method was applied. In total, 172 individual aggregates of the sediment horizon with the highest aggregate abundance at the Beggiatoa site (ATL19; 1 to 2 cm) were measured after staining with DAPI. Average volumes were 150 m 3 for spherical aggregates and 330 m 3 for nonspherical aggregates. Cell numbers in the aggregates were calculated based on the assumption that aggregates are either spheres or cylinders consisting of ANME-3 cells with a volume of 0.2 m 3 . This estimate was corrected by the packing density (74%; http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePacking.html) for the closest packing of spheres. Since most aggregates were associated with only very few SRB, SRB cell numbers were neglected during calculation. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequence data reported here will appear in the EMBL, GenBank, and DDBJ nucleotide sequence databases under the accession no. AJ579313 to AJ579330, AJ704632 to AJ704644, AJ704654 to AJ704724, AM404330 to AM404331, and AM407728 to AM407730. Bacterial diversity in HMMV sediments. In total, 254 bacterial clones (from center sediments, 72; from Beggiatoa mats, 132; from the tubeworm field, 50) were analyzed. The compositions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries for the different sampling sites differed remarkably. Many HMMV 16S rRNA gene clones showed high sequence similarity (Ͼ97%) to sequences of uncultivated microorganisms from other methane-rich habitats. In oxic sediments of the volcano center, the least bacterial diversity was observed. Applying a Ͻ97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity criterion (27), we found 13 phylotypes, of which 10 were related to methylotrophic Gammaproteobacteria (Methylobacter and Methylophaga) (Fig. 2 ). Only few sequences grouped within two other phylogenetic lineages, namely the Bacteroidetes phylum and the WCHB1 cluster (sequences isolated from a hydrocarbon-and chlorinated-solvent-contaminated aquifer) (15) . In the clone library from anoxic sediments below Beggiatoa mats 25 phylotypes were detected. Most sequences were affiliated with Bacteroidetes phylum (five phylotypes, 59 sequences total). Additionally, aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria (seven phylotypes, 37 sequences total) and Deltaproteobacteria The tree was calculated with nearly full-length sequences (Ͼ1,450 bp) by maximum-likelihood analysis in combination with filters, which consider only 50% conserved regions of the 16S rRNA of Deltaproteobacteria.

Partial sequences were subsequently inserted into the reconstructed consensus tree by parsimony criteria, without allowing changes in the overall tree topology.

VOL. 73, 2007 METHANE OXIDIZERS AT AN ARCTIC MUD VOLCANO 3353 related sequences (seven phylotypes, 22 sequences total) (Fig. 3 ) were abundant at this site. The level of bacterial diversity, in particular, the level of diversity of SRB within the class Deltaproteobacteria, was highest in the clone library from the tubeworm site with 37 phylotypes and 23 phylotypes, respectively (Fig. 3) . Other phylogenetic lineages were only rarely retrieved (one to three sequences) and included the Actinobacteria (one phylotype), Acidobacterium/Holophaga (three phylotypes), Planctomycetes (two phylotypes), Verrucomicrobia (one phylotype), Betaproteobacteria (one phylotype), the Nitrospira lineage (one phylotype), and the uncultured OP8 lineages (one phylotype). Methanotrophic and methylotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. HMMV clone sequences related to aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria were retrieved from surface sediments of the center (67 of 72 sequences) or from the adjacent Beggiatoa mat area (37 of 132 sequences) but not from the tubeworm site. Sediments at both sites were methane-rich and showed an in situ oxygen penetration depth of only a few millimeters or less (9) . Three sequence clades could be defined: HMMV-MetI, HMMV-MetII, and HMMV-MPH (Fig.  2) . HMMV-MetI (six phylotypes) and HMMV-MetII (one phylotype) were most abundant in the libraries and closely related to each other. The members of both groups belong to the order Methylococcales. HMMV-MetI 16S rRNA gene sequences were most closely related (94 to 97%) to sequences of methanotrophic mussel symbionts (13, 14) . HMMV-MetII were most similar (96 to 99%) to clone sequence Hyd24-1 from gas hydrate-bearing sediments of Hydrate Ridge (34) . Methylobacter marinus was the closest cultivated relative of both clusters (89 to 97%). The third gammaproteobacterial clade, HMMV-MPH, was related (87 to 94%) to the methylotrophic genus Methylophaga. The most similar sequences (92 to 100%) were obtained from marine bacterioplankton. Deltaproteobacteria. Sequences within the class Deltaproteobacteria were highly diverse (Fig. 3) , and the highest diversity was found at the tubeworm site (23 phylotypes; 34 sequences total). Many known orders (Desulfovibrionales, Desulfobacterales, Synthrophobacterales, and Bdellovibrionales) were represented. Most clone sequences from sediments below Beggiatoa mats fell into the recently defined seep-specific clades of SRB (34), SEEP-SRB1 (Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus-related), SEEP-SRB3 (Desulfobulbus-related), and SEEP-SRB4 (Desulforhopalus-related). Members of SEEP-SRB1 are supposed to be the sulfate-reducing partners of ANME-1 and ANME-2, while the ecological role of SEEP-SRB3 and SEEP-SRB4 is still unknown. Further HMMV sequences are related to Desulfobacterium anilii and its relatives. This group is known to include several cultivated as well as uncultivated hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria capable of complete oxidation of various aromatic hydrocarbons (84) . Additionally, non-SRB sequences of the Deltaproteobacteria were also present in HMMV clone libraries (Fig. 3) : a minor fraction of clone sequences (one phylotype) was related to Bacteriovorax stolpii (90 to 91%). Bacteriovorax spp. and its relatives are aerobic, obligately predatory bacteria that forage on a wide variety of susceptible gram-negative microorganisms (2) and thereby may control bacterial abundance. They have been found in a wide range of aquatic habitats, e.g., in freshwater and marine sediments and biofilms (31) . Archaeal diversity in HMMV sediments. In total, 159 archaeal clones (from center sediments, 67; from Beggiatoa mats, 48; from the tubeworm field, 44) were analyzed. These were affiliated with only five different archaeal groups. The differences between the sampling sites were substantial. In the library of center sediments, only sequences belonging to the crenarchaeotal marine benthic group C (MBGC) were found (two phylotypes; 67 clone sequences total) (Fig. 4) . This group has often been found at methane seeps (76, 79) but is not restricted to seeps (6, 39) . Within MBGC, HMMV sequences form a separate branch (hereafter referred to as HMMVCren) of highly similar sequences often exceeding 99% similarity. In contrast, the Beggiatoa mat site contained only sequences affiliated with the novel euryarchaeotal clade named ANME-3 (35) (two phylotypes; 48 clone sequences total); HMMV data are shown in reference 54. The archaeal 16S rRNA gene library from the tubeworm site was again most diverse (13 phylotypes) and dominated by Crenarchaeota of the marine benthic group B (alternatively referred to as the deep-sea archaeal group, with five phylotypes and 40 clone sequences total). Marine benthic group B is generally associated with methane-rich surface and subsurface environments, but its function remains unknown (3, 29, 35) . Other retrieved phylotypes belonged to euryarchaeotal ANME-1 archaea (one phylotype) as well as the crenarchaeotal groups MBGC (two phylotypes) and marine group I archaea (six phylotypes) (Fig. 4) . Members of the ANME-2 group were detected with FISH in sediments at the base of the tubeworm roots (54) but were not found in the clone library from the surface sediments. Identification of dominant microbial groups and quantification of in situ cell numbers. In situ cell abundances were determined with FISH or CARD-FISH to investigate which groups within the methanotrophic guilds dominate the different habitats of the HMMV. To study spatial variability, three sediment cores as replicates of the Beggiatoa site and the tubeworm field and two cores of the center sediments were analyzed in replicate. Free-living methylotrophs and Bacteroidetes in center sediments. Total cell numbers were up to 3.6 ϫ 10 9 Ϯ 2.1 ϫ 10 9 cells cm Ϫ3 in the uppermost sediment layer (Ͻ1-cm sediment depth) and decreased to less than 1 ϫ 10 8 cells cm Ϫ3 at 6-to 10-cm sediment depths (Table 2) . Detection rates of FISH with monolabeled oligonucleotide probes were high, with up to 98% DAPI-stained cells. Thus, no CARD-FISH was needed. Bacteria of cluster HMMV-MetI (probe MetI-444) were most abundant, with 48% Ϯ 2% of total cells, and clearly dominated the microbial community in center sediments (Table 2 ). This percentage corresponds to an absolute number of 1.7 ϫ 10 9 Ϯ 0.9 ϫ 10 9 cells cm Ϫ3 sediment. HMMV-MetI cells were mainly diplococci with a diameter of 0.7 m. A second morphotype of MetI-444 was constituted of large cocci with a diameter of about 2 m. They occurred in clusters of three or more cells (Fig. 5A) . The DAPI staining of the clustered cells was irregular, indicating the presence of intracellular membrane systems which are characteristic for aerobic methanotrophs (22) . HMMV-MetI abundance decreased with sediment depth to 26% Ϯ 11% of the total cells at 9-to 10-cm sediment depths. HMMV-MetII (probe MetII-844) could also be detected in situ but in a lower abundance, with a maximum of 1. a FISH probe names are in parentheses; for probe specificity, see Table 1 . ND, not determined. b Percentages of detected DAPI-stained single cells. c Multiple independent MUC cores were examined for spatial variability: two cores of center sediments and three cores each of sediments covered with Beggiatoa mats and sediments from the tubeworm field.

In general, HMMV-MetII cells occurred as cocci with an average diameter of 1 to 2 m (Fig. 5B) . The third abundant clone group in center sediments, HMMV-MPH, accounted for 5% Ϯ 4% at the sediment surface and abundance decreased with depth. Target cells were morphologically uniform and occurred as small (Ͻ1-m) oval cells (Fig. 5C) . Hence, free-living aerobic methanotrophs accounted in total for 56% Ϯ 8% at 0-to 1-cm sediment depths. In addition to aerobic methanotrophs, up to 33% of the cells could be assigned to the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium cluster of the Bacteroidetes by use of probe CF319a. Deltaproteobacterial groups were detected only in low percentages (Ͻ0.5%). Detection rates of archaea in center sediments ranged from Ͻ1% to 17% of total cells, with a maximum in 6-to 7-cm sediment depths. The crenarchaeotal group HMMV-Cren was FIG. 5 .

MICROBIOL. the only clone group in our archaeal clone library from center sediments, but its members were detected in situ only in low abundance (Ͻ1%). Target cells were on average 5-m-long slender rods and occurred as single cells or in chains of up to 10 cells. ANME-1, ANME-2, and ANME-3 archaea could not be detected in situ, and the major fraction of Archaea at the center site remained unidentified. Further probes need to be developed and/or CARD-FISH must be applied to achieve higher detection rates. ANME-3 aggregates in sediments below Beggiatoa mats. In our previous study, we demonstrated the dominance of ANME-3/Desulfobulbus aggregates (ANME-3/DBB) in sediments below Beggiatoa mats (54) . In this study, we give a detailed description of their morphological characteristics and abundance along vertical profiles at three Beggiatoa sites. Using two probes (ANME3-1249 and ANME3-397) specific for ANME-3 archaea, we identified the coccoid cells in the consortia as ANME-3 cells (0.7 m diameter). All ANME-3 cells were autofluorescent under UV excitation, indicating the presence of coenzyme F 420 , which is a characteristic feature of methanogens (78) . Hybridization signals of the monolabeled probe ANME3-1249 were dim; therefore, we developed the helper probes (17) ANME-3-1249H3 and ANME-3-1249H5 (Table 1) and added them to the hybridization reaction or used HRP-labeled probes for CARD-FISH (60) . Both procedures resulted in bright signals. The associated bacteria were identified as rod-shaped SRB (1.1 by 0.5 m) affiliated with Desulfobulbus species (DBB) by using probe 660 (11) , which has one mismatch to the clone sequences retrieved from HMMV, and a newly designed probe (DBB305; zero mismatches). The ANME-3/DBB aggregates mainly occurred as shell-type spheres (35) . Sometimes acridine orange staining showed the presence of an exopolysaccharide matrix enclosing several aggregates. Often several spheres were aligned to an overall cylindrical morphology and the DBB layer formed only an incomplete outer shell consisting of a few cells (Fig. 5D , E, and G). The size spectrum of the diameters of ANME-3/DBB consortia ranged from 2 to 50 m, with an average diameter of 5 Ϯ 3 m for spherical aggregates and a width of 5 Ϯ 3 m and a height of 10 Ϯ 5 m for cylindrical aggregates (several spherical aggregates together). High ANME-3/DBB aggregate numbers were restricted to the sediment layers directly below the Beggiatoa mat (1-to 3-cm depths) with up to 19.7 ϫ 10 6 Ϯ 0.6 ϫ 10 6 cm Ϫ3 sediment (Table 2 ). Aggregate numbers decreased by two orders of magnitude below a 7-cm sediment depth. The average spherical aggregate comprised approximately 550 ANME-3 cells, whereas cylindrical aggregates were built up on average with 1,250 ANME-3 cells. The observed ratio of spheres to cylinders (73:27) was taken into account, resulting in an average of 740 ANME-3 cells per HMMV aggregate. Calculated cell numbers in ANME-3 aggregates accounted for 75 to 94% of total cells, comprising the major part of the microbial biomass in a 0-to 5-cm sediment depth interval at the Beggiatoa site. The distribution of ANME-3/DBB aggregates was almost identical in three sediment cores sampled from different areas of the Beggiatoa species-covered zone of the HMMV (Table 2) . Very few consortia were detected with a yet-unidentified bacterial partner. These ANME-3/bacterial aggregates showed a mixed-type morphology and appeared to grow in direct association with each other (Fig. 6H) . Almost 25% of HMMV aggregates occurred without any obvious bacterial partners. These probably monospecific ANME-3 aggregates were more tightly packed and were enclosed by a thick exopolysaccharide layer. In the horizon with highest ANME-3/DBB abundance (1-to 2-cm depths) we also found a remarkably high number of single ANME-3 cells, accounting for 25% of total single cells (1.2 ϫ 10 9 cells cm Ϫ3 ) (Fig. 5F and data not shown) . Single DBB cells were only rarely detected (Ͻ Ͻ0.5% of total single cells). Abundance of other bacterial groups below Beggiatoa mats. Members of Bacteroidetes dominated the bacterial community, constituting up to 23% of total single cells in the upper sediment layers. Gammaproteobacteria of the aerobic methanotrophic clusters HMMV-MetI and HMMV-MetII were also detected in 0-to 4-cm sediment depths, with a maximum of 9% Ϯ 2% of total single cells (3.9 ϫ 10 8 Ϯ 2.5 ϫ 10 8 cells cm Ϫ3 ) in 0-to 1-cm sediment depths. Methanotrophic bacteria were not detectable in deeper sediments layers. Members of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus branch dominated in these sediment depths (4 to 10 cm), constituting up to 17% of the total single cells. Cooccurrence of different ANME groups in sediments of the tubeworm field. In sediments populated with siboglinid tubeworms, ANME-3/DBB aggregates were detected throughout three sediment cores with a low abundance, having a maximum of 6 ϫ 10 5 Ϯ 5 ϫ 10 5 aggregates cm Ϫ3 (Table 2 ). In our previous study, we found the highest AOM rate between the base of the worm tubes and hydrate layers (60-to 90-cm depths) coinciding with a subsurface peak of ANME-2/DSS aggregates (5.5 ϫ 10 6 aggregates cm Ϫ3 [54] ). However, in the uppermost 14 cm of the tubeworm sites, ANME-2/DSS aggregates were not detected. Few ANME-1 cells (Fig. 5I) were present in a single sediment horizon (9-to 10-cm depth; Ͻ0.5% of total single cells). Although bacterial diversity was highest at the tubeworm site, FISH detection rates of single cells at this site were much lower than the detection rates at the other sites, with a maximum rate of 32% of total single cells. Cells detected by CF319a were most abundant, at up to 10% (Table 2 ; Fig. 5J ). Gammaproteobacteria of HMMV-specific sequence clades HMMVMetI, HMMV-MetII, and HMMV-MPH were not detectable. Sorting of ANME-3/DBB aggregates. ANME-3/DBB aggregates were sorted by flow cytometry in order to further characterize the DBB cells associated with ANME-3 archaea, because only a single DBB-related sequence (clone HMMVBeg-DBB4) was retrieved from the Beggiatoa site clone library. The purity of the sorted fraction was high, with Ͼ99% of the cells belonging to ANME-3/DBB aggregates. The archaeal clone library of the sorted cells contained three types of highly similar ANME-3 sequences, which differed only in a single base and were Ͼ99% similar to sequences originally retrieved from the Beggiatoa site (data not shown). In the bacterial clone library of the sorted aggregates, we found DBB sequences (clones HMMV-sortedANME-3agg-Bac104 and HMMVsortedANME-3agg-Bac125) (Fig. 2) Basin (76) , and two other aquatic sediments (GenBank accession no. AY193761 and AY123207/AY123218). The closest cultivated relative of the HMMV DBB sequences is Desulfobulbus mediterraneus (94%). By use of a new, specific FISH probe (DBBA665) ( Table 1 ; Fig. 3 ), members of this phylogenetic clade were confirmed to be the bacterial partners of ANME-3 archaea. Diversity of mcrA genes. To further describe the diversity of methane-oxidizing archaea in sediments below Beggiatoa mats, clone libraries for the mcrA gene were constructed. The mcrA gene codes for the alpha subunit of methyl-coenzyme M-reductase, which is the key enzyme in methanogenesis and supposed to be involved in AOM (21, 36, 69) . Comparative sequence analysis of deduced amino acid sequences (Ͼ247 amino acids) of 170 clones showed the presence of two lineages. Most HMMV sequences (165 of 170 clone sequences) were closely related (90 to 93%) to a clone sequence from methane-rich Kuroshima Knoll sediments (GenBank accession no. BAD16558), forming a novel clade of mcrA sequences within the order Methanosarcinales (Fig. 6 ). We call this clade ""group f"" and extend the existing naming scheme (groups a, b, c, d, and e) suggested by Hallam et al. (21) . Four HMMV phylotypes within the clade could be distinguished (93 to 98% sequence identity). Phylogenies of mcrA and 16S rRNA genes are congruent: mcrA group f is closely related to cultivated genera, namely, Methanococcoides and Methanolobus (79 to 83% sequence identity). Furthermore, we obtained mcrA sequences from sorted ANME-3 aggregates which were identical with group f HMMV sequences. Thus, we conclude that these sequences originated from ANME-3 archaea. A small number of HMMV sequences (5 of 170 sequences) grouped with sequences of mcrA group e (Fig. 6) , which most likely represents ANME-2a archaea. Diversity of methanotrophic guilds. Our detailed molecular characterization of the three main habitats of HMMV shows that habitat variations (Fig. 1) are clearly reflected by differences in the bacterial and archaeal diversity and in situ abundance. Horizontally, the HMMV habitats cover hundreds of meters of seafloor and differ with respect to environmental factors, such as fluid flow and energy availability (see the introduction). Vertically, the niches for methanotrophic microorganisms can be described as microhabitats, according to their extension of only a few millimeters or centimeters, which are controlled by the distribution of electron acceptors such as oxygen and sulfate. The habitats at HMMV seem to be rather stable on time scales of years, since the analysis of replicate cores distributed over tens and hundreds of meters resulted in highly similar abundances and distributions of aerobic methanotrophs (groups HMMV-MetI, HMMV-MetII, and HMMV-MPH) at the volcano center and anaerobic meth- FIG. 6 .

Clone sequences from sediments below Beggiatoa mats are in boldface type. mcrA sequences from sorted ANME-3-aggregates (not shown in the tree) were identical to those of the HMMV clones in group f.

LÖ SEKANN ET AL. APPL. ENVIRON. MICROBIOL. anotrophs (ANME-3) at the Beggiatoa site. This indicates stable selection mechanisms for the methanotrophic community. The methanotrophic guilds of HMMV are composed of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms which are responsible for the remarkably large microbial biomass present in the mud volcano surface sediments. Different aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophic groups accounted for up to 94% of the microbial biomass (Beggiatoa site, 2-to 3-cm sediment depths). In the volcano center and at the Beggiatoa site, carbon sources other than methane are not available. Only one phylogenetic group strongly dominated, suggesting that the limited carbon substrate spectrum appears to limit the diversity of the microbial community. Both habitats are characterized by high methane concentrations over the entire vertical profile (54) and a limited oxygen penetration depth of a few millimeters (9) . There are only four studies published (5, 35, 53, 56) providing quantitative in situ data on different anaerobic methanotrophic communities and SRB at methane-seep sites. Other studies on environmental methanotrophs used methods such as lipid biomarker analysis (e.g., (4) or slot blot hybridizations (77) . In these studies, the dominance of one methanotrophic group over several cooccurring groups was reported for different habitats, namely, the Hydrate Ridge methane seeps (5, 35) , which are strongly dominated by ANME-2a and ANME-2c groups, and the Black Sea microbial mats (4, 35, 46, 77) and the Gulf of Mexico sediments (40, 56) , which are both dominated by the ANME-1 group. The high dominance of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria at the HMMV center and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea at the Beggiatoa site is reflected in a low microbial diversity (16 and 26 phylotypes, respectively) at these sites. The archaeal diversity was extremely low compared to most other methaneseep sites investigated so far (24, 28, 35, 40, 48, 49, 57, 74, 76) . This might be explained by the limited vertical extension of the mud volcano habitat of only a few centimeters below seafloor and/or other constraints in populating muds emitted from subsurface depths. The microbial diversity increased considerably in zones outside of highest fluid flow (51 microbial phylotypes) which were populated by siboglinid tubeworms. Here, aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidizers were less abundant in the top 10 cm of sediment and the total microbial biomass in the uppermost three centimeters was only about 9% of that at the Beggiatoa site (the tubeworm field biomass in 0-to 10-cm depth was ϳ30% of that at the Beggiatoa site). The tubeworm site is characterized by the dense colonization of the sediments with tubeworms above thin layers of gas hydrates. Electron acceptors such as oxygen and sulfate are transported by bioirrigation deep into the sediments (9, 54) . The presence of the tubeworms likely enhanced availability of organic carbon other than methane, e.g., worm exudates and sediments particles trapped by the worm tubes, and increased the diversity of heterotrophic groups of bacteria and crenarchaeotal groups. Habitat and diversity of aerobic methanotrophs. The HMMV is the first cold seep for which high in situ abundance of aerobic methanotrophs could be demonstrated. Ten phylotypes of aerobic methanotrophs dominate the highly gassy sediments of the center of the volcano and reach high abundances in a very narrow oxic sediment horizon at the seafloor. The specific biogeochemistry of the freshly expelled center sediments may promote the growth of aerobic methanotrophs. The sediments of the volcano center are permanently vented by ascending methane-rich fluids but also mixed with deep-subsurface sediments during events of mud eruption. The organic content of the center sediments is very low, and methane is most likely the main carbon source for microbial life. A high upward flow of sulfate-free subsurface fluids limits the penetration of sulfate and oxygen from the seawater to the uppermost centimeter of the sediment (9) and thereby excludes ANME archaea from these sediments. Sulfide levels at the center were below the detection limit (9), confirming that AOM was not a significant process. High concentrations of ␦ 13 C-depleted (Ϫ89‰) bacterial fatty acids (e.g., C 16:18c ) assigned to type 1 methanotrophs and high aerobic methane oxidation rates (0.9 mol m Ϫ2 yr Ϫ1 [54] ) support the 16S rRNAbased results of this study. Habitat and diversity of anaerobic methanotrophs. The sediments below Beggiatoa mats at the HMMV represent the first habitat known to host a microbial community dominated by ANME-3 biomass. The maximum abundance of ANME-3 cells occurred in the upper sediment layers below Beggiatoa mats, with up to 94% Ϯ 2% of total cells, and correlated with high concentrations of archaeal lipids (dominance of pentamethylicosene with four double bonds [PMI:4] and PMI:5) from which ␦ 13 C (Ϫ109‰) was highly depleted (54) . However, the ANME-3 habitat was limited to a rather narrow zone below oxygen penetration, in the zone of sulfate diffusion between 1-and 3-cm sediment depth (9) . In this layer, AOM rates were high, at 4.5 mol m Ϫ2 yr Ϫ1 (54) . Whereas ANME-1 and ANME-2 archaea are associated with SRB of the DesulfosarcinaDesulfococcus branch (83), ANME-3 archaea are the first anaerobic methanotrophs known to associate with Desulfobulbus species. Only a few environmental sequences from this bacterial group have been obtained. Only two out of the six known ANME-3 habitats also hosted DBB sequences (Mediterranean mud volcano [GenBank accession no. AY592579] and Eel River Basin [57] ). Curiously, although ANME-3/DBB aggregates were responsible for up to 94% Ϯ 2% of the microbial biomass below Beggiatoa mats at HMMV, DBB-related clones were not found among 132 analyzed clones in our general 16S rRNA gene library of Bacteria. Only a single clone (HMMVBeg-DBB4) (Fig. 3) out of 102 clones from a second library constructed by using a DBB-specific PCR (primer DBB305/ GM4) (data not shown) was identified as a DBB relative. Organisms of this group might have mismatches to one of the general PCR primers and therefore may be underrepresented in the clone libraries. In contrast to the sulfate-reducing partner of ANME-2 (DSS) (5, 35, 57, 58) , DBB cells seem to be only loosely associated with the ANME-3 archaea, and the ratio of DBB cells to ANME-3 cells is Ͻ Ͻ1. Interestingly, we also found a substantial number of single ANME-3 cells below Beggiatoa mats at the HMMV. In addition, there was a high percentage of ANME-3 aggregates without a sulfate-reducing partner. These observations suggest that a physical association with DBB cells may not be obligatory for ANME-3 archaea. Alternatively, treatment of samples might have released DBB and/or ANME-3 single cells to the environment. Furthermore, some ANME-3 cells occurred with yet unidentified bacteria, forming mixed-type aggregates, suggesting that ANME-3 cells VOL. 73, 2007 METHANE OXIDIZERS AT AN ARCTIC MUD VOLCANO 3359 do not necessarily depend on DBB as a sulfate-reducing partner and might be able to live syntrophically with other partners as well. A novel type of mcrA in ANME-3 archaea. Methanotrophic archaea have been shown to harbor genes encoding the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M-reductase, which is involved in the terminal step in methane formation from CO 2 in methanogenic archaea (for a review, see reference 69). Previous analyses have revealed considerably diversity within mcrA genes among ANME archaea, and five subgroups have been defined (1, 12, 20, 21, 30, 40, 55) : groups a and b and groups c and d have been assigned to ANME-1 and ANME-2 archaea, respectively. A phylogenetic relationship for group e is not clear yet; it may be assigned to ANME-2a archaea (1), while groups c and d probably represent ANME-2c archaea (A. Meyerdierks, personal communication). Here, we describe a novel cluster of mcrA genes, group f. As shown for all known orders of methanotrophs (42, 73) , mcrA group f and ANME-3 16S rRNA gene sequences show congruent tree topologies, having Methanococcoides spp. and Methanolobus spp. as their closest relatives. Furthermore, the microbial biomass at the Beggiatoa site is strongly dominated by ANME-3 and identical sequences of mcrA gene group f were retrieved from sorted ANME-3/DBB aggregates. Thus, we conclude that the mcrA gene group f sequences originate from ANME-3 archaea.

9382611,"Microbial Community Composition and Functional Capacity in a Terrestrial Ferruginous, Sulfate-Depleted Mud Volcano","Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) are an important natural source of methane emission. The role of microbial processes in methane cycling and organic transformation in such environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to uncover functional potentials and community assemblages across geochemical transitions in a ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV of eastern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles combined with 16S rRNA gene abundances indicated that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by ANME-2a group coincided with iron/manganese reduction by Desulfuromonadales at shallow depths deprived of sulfate. The activity of AOM was stimulated either by methane alone or by methane and a range of electron acceptors, such as sulfate, ferrihydrite, and artificial humic acid. Metagenomic analyses revealed that functional genes for AOM and metal reduction were more abundant at shallow intervals. In particular, genes encoding pili expression and electron transport through multi-heme cytochromes were prevalent, suggesting potential intercellular interactions for electron transport involved in AOM. For comparison, genes responsible for methanogenesis and degradation of chitin and plant-derived molecules were more abundant at depth. The gene distribution combined with the enhanced proportions of 16S rRNA genes related to methanogens and heterotrophs, and geochemical characteristics suggest that particulate organic matter was degraded into various organic entities that could further fuel in situ methanogenesis. Finally, genes responsible for aerobic methane oxidation were more abundant in the bubbling pool and near-surface sediments. These methane oxidizers account for the ultimate attenuation of methane discharge into the atmosphere. Overall, our results demonstrated that various community members were compartmentalized into stratified niches along geochemical gradients. These community members form a metabolic network that cascades the carbon transformation from the upstream degradation of recalcitrant organic carbon with fermentative production of labile organic entities and methane to downstream methane oxidation and metal reduction near the surface. Such a metabolic architecture enables effective methane removal under ferruginous, sulfate-depleted conditions in terrestrial MVs.","Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) are an important natural source of methane emission.

Overall, our results demonstrated that various community members were compartmentalized into stratified niches along geochemical gradients. These community members form a metabolic network that cascades the carbon transformation from the upstream degradation of recalcitrant organic carbon Mud volcanoes (MVs) are prominent surface expressions in compressional tectonic regimes (Kopf, 2002) . They are morphologically diverse, ranging from mud pies to conical structures, from which gaseous fluids with unconsolidated, fine-grained sediments are expelled (Dimitrov, 2002; Kopf, 2002) . Often, methane with CO 2 and minor amounts of C 2+ hydrocarbons constitute the emitted phase (Mazzini et al., 2009) . Recent estimates have revealed that MVs and seepages onshore and offshore might account for 27-36% of methane emissions from natural sources (Reeburgh, 2007; Etiope et al., 2008) . Considering the potentially huge storage of methane in subsurface environments (Milkov et al., 2003) , uncovering the regulative mechanisms involved in methane cycling and related metabolisms would enable better assessments of methane emission over various time scales (Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Net methane emission in terrestrial MVs is governed by physical and chemical characteristics of fluid reservoir, transportation styles, fluid pathways, and in situ microbial activities (Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Unlike their marine counterparts, whose emissions are mitigated by aerobic methane oxidation in seawater above them, terrestrial MVs emit methane directly into the atmosphere. Previous studies have indicated that the exact quantity of methane emission is primarily controlled by in situ microbial production and consumption near the surface (Alain et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012; Wrede et al., 2012; Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . The general framework for such microbial control has been speculated to share similarity with soil ecosystems where the decomposition of detrital organic carbon or dead plant biomass produces CO 2 or small organic compounds that could be converted into methane under strictly anoxic conditions (Achtnich et al., 1995; Davidson and Janssens, 2006) . Methane is either directly released into the atmosphere or oxidized with electron acceptors within sediments or from surface (e.g., oxygen, sulfate, or metal oxides) Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . Although the fate of methane produced in situ has been demonstrated in previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) , the assemblage and distribution of community members responsible for upstream organic mineralization and production of precursors (e.g., H 2 , acetate, and methyl-compounds) for methanogenesis in terrestrial MV environments have not been fully revealed. Most terrestrial MVs are characterized by a limited availability of sulfate (<1 mM). Such a low quantity of sulfate would increase the free energy (less negative) and drive sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) less energetically favorable. Therefore, whether the syntrophic partnerships between ANME groups and sulfate reducing Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus or Desulfobulbus clusters commonly observed in sulfate-rich marine settings (Knittel and Boetius, 2009 ) could be maintained or succeeded with different cell organization and metabolic pathway is not clear. On the basis of geochemical characteristics, incubation experiments, and microscopic observations, AOM using electron acceptors other than sulfate, such as ferric oxides, manganese oxides, nitrate, and humic acids, have been proposed or validated for marine sediments, freshwater sediments, wetland sediments, or anaerobic wastewater sludge (Beal et al., 2009; Haroon et al., 2013; Deutzmann et al., 2014; Egger et al., 2014; Ettwig et al., 2016; Scheller et al., 2016; Valenzuela et al., 2017) . The feasibility of these electron acceptors for AOM catalyzed by a given community has not been demonstrated for terrestrial MV environments. The aim of this study is to uncover the gene and community compositions involved in methanogenesis and methane oxidation, and the effect of various electron acceptors on AOM activity in a terrestrial ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV. The Lei-Gong-Hou (LGH) MVs in eastern Taiwan were chosen for this investigation because previous studies have indicated that AOM mediated by the ANME-2a group cooccurred with iron/manganese reduction potentially catalyzed by Desulfuromonas spp. and Pelobacter spp. under low-sulfate conditions Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . The switchable interlayering of AOM and methanogenesis with respect to depth further highlights that in situ methanogenesis driven by the decomposition of carbohydrate is essential to supply methane for AOM at adjacent depths. To further investigate the potential of AOM, and microbial community composition and functional capacity across geochemical gradients, we collected geochemical and molecular data for a sediment core, and performed incubations of mud slurries supplied with 13 C-labeled methane and a variety of terminal electron acceptors. These data sets were further combined and integrated to demonstrate the flexibility of AOM processes, and the gene patterns and community compositions involved in methane and organic cycling.  Muddy fluids from a bubbling pool (named LGH03) and a core with a total length of 160 cm from the pool margin were retrieved from the LGHMVs in eastern Taiwan in July of 2011 for geochemical and molecular analyses. Fluids from another bubbling pool (named LGH09) and sediments at a depth of 10 cm on the pool margin were collected and mixed at a ratio of 1:1 in a serum bottle with no headspace left in August of 2015 for incubations. Geological and site backgrounds of LGHMVs have been described in previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . After retrieval, samples were transported to the laboratory within 5 h and the core was immediately sectioned at 5-cm intervals for analyses of gas and aqueous geochemistry, and DNA. The represented depth was the average depth of individual sectioned intervals. For gas geochemistry, a total of 6 mL of sediments from sectioned sediments was preserved in a serum bottle filled with 10 mL of 1 M NaOH, and sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum ring. The remaining sediments were subject to centrifugation at 8,200 × g for 15 min for aqueous geochemistry. Supernatants were filtered through 0.22-µm pore-sized polyethersulfone filters and split into four fractions. The cation fraction was preserved with 1/10 by volume of 2 M nitric acid. The fractions for anions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) individually were stored in prewashed vials without any preservative at 4 • C (for anions) or −20 • C (for DOC). The fraction for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was sealed in serum bottles and acidified with phosphorous acid. Concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn were measured using an Ultima2 inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, United States). Concentrations of anions were determined using an ion chromatograph (ICS-3000, Dionex, United States). DOC was oxidized to CO 2 through thermal catalytic conversion and measured using a Shimadzu TOC analyzer (TOC-L). The abundances of DIC and gaseous hydrocarbon compounds in headspace were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a Porapak Q column, a thermal conductivity detector, and a flame ionization detector (6890N, Agilent Taiwan, Taiwan). The measured partial pressure of a specific gas compound was converted into the dissolved concentration with the volume of pore water. Concentrations of particulate total organic carbon (TOC) were determined by an elemental analyzer (EA, vario MICRO cube, Elementar). Carbon isotopic compositions of DIC, methane, and TOC were determined using a GC IsoLink or Flash EA in line with a MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). The isotopic compositions were reported using the δ notation (in permil, ): where the standard is referred to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The uncertainties for aqueous and gas geochemistry, elemental abundance of TOC, and δ 13 C are ±2%, ±5%, ±2%, and ±0.3 , respectively. The detectable limits for anions and cations with the consideration of dilution were 10 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respectively. Spearman's correlation was employed to examine the relationships between environmental factors. Crude DNA for 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses of environmental samples was extracted from 10 g of fluids/sediments in the bubbling pool (0 cm) and eleven depth intervals (2.5, 7.5, 12.5, 17.5, 27.5, 47.5, 67.5, 87.5, 107.5, 127.5, and 157.5  High-throughput sequencing of dual-indexed PCR amplicons encompassing the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was used to assess community compositions along depth and in incubated slurries. Fragments of 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the primer combinations of F515 (5 -GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-3 ) and R806 (5 -CCC GTC AAT TCM TTT RAG T-3 ) that target both bacterial and archaeal communities (Kozich et al., 2013) . Both forward and reverse primers were barcoded and appended with the Illumina-specific adapters. Each PCR mixture contained 1.1-1.5 ng of purified genomic DNA, 1 U of ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Japan), 0.2 mM of dNTPs, 0.2 µM of each primer, and 5 µl of 10× PCR buffer in a total volume of 25 µL. Thermal cycling involved a denaturation step at 94 • C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 • C for 45 s, annealing at 55 • C for 45 s, extension at 72 • C for 90 s, and a final extension step at 72 • C for 10 min. The products of three independent PCRs for individual samples were pooled, analyzed by gel electrophoresis for size verification (∼ 400 bp), and purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research, United States). Amplicons from different samples were pooled in equal quantities sufficient for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, United States). Quantitative PCR was used to analyze the 16S rRNA gene copy number of bacteria, archaea, and ANME-2a in the environmental samples and incubated mud slurries using a MyiQ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, United States). All samples were analyzed in triplicate reactions (20 µl each) with each composed of 1× SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, United States), 100 nM of each primer, and 2 µL of template DNA. Primers and PCR conditions were the same as those described in Chang et al. (2012) and Wang P.-L. et al. (2014) . The 16S rRNA gene copy number of a specific group was calculated assuming 650 g mole −1 of one base pair of DNA. Sequences of 16S rRNA gene amplicons were analyzed using the Mothur 1.34 following the standard protocols (Schloss et al., 2009 ). Barcoded sequences were de-multiplexed and filtered to remove low quality reads (Phread score < 25). Reads that had more than two mismatches to the paired barcode sequences were removed by the noise reduction while retaining the information of the representative reads and the numbers of reads merged by pre-clustering (Huse et al., 2010) . The unique reads were aligned to the Silva NR119 database 1 . Reads not aligned in the same region were removed. The sequence regions beyond the primers were truncated. Potential chimeric sequences were detected and removed using the UCHIME program (Edgar et al., 2011) . The number of sequences in each sample after quality filtering is shown in Supplementary Table S1 . The taxonomy of each unique sequence was assigned using the Silva SSU dataset of the NR 119 release as the reference. Taxonomy assignments with bootstrap values greater than 80% were considered to be valid. Sequences sharing more than 97% identity were further clustered into individual operational taxonomy units (OTUs) using the nearest neighbor algorithm (Schloss and Westcott, 2011) . Based on the rarefied datasets (n = 10,008), alpha diversity indices, such as the number of observed OTUs, Chao-1, and Inverse Simpson (Hill, 1973; Chao et al., 1984; Faith, 1992) , were computed. The weighted Unifrac (Lozupone and Knight, 2007) , which quantitatively incorporates the relatedness of community members with their abundances for the evaluation of difference between samples, was used to determine the community dissimilarity between samples from the sediment core. In addition, analyses of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was conducted on the basis of the weighted Unifrac distance matrix using the software Mothur 1.34 (Schloss et al., 2009) . The significance of environmental variables relative to the NMDS ordinations was computed using ""envfit"" and 999 permutations. Finally, the dissimilarity matrix between samples from the sediment core and incubations was constructed by the Bray-Curtis method (Bray and Curtis, 1957) and visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) using the R ""Phyloseq"" package. Based on the geochemical characteristics of pore fluids and gases, crude DNA extracted from samples from the bubbling pool and 2.5, 17.5, 27.5, 47.5, 87.5, and 127.5 cm of the core was selected for metagenomic analyses. In brief, metagenomic libraries with an insert size of 200-600 bp and 50 ng of DNA of each sample were prepared using the Ovation Ultralow System V2 1-96 (Nugen Technologies, United States). Paired-end sequencing (2× 300 bp) was performed on an Illumina Miseq platform. Low quality reads with a Phread score below 25, a length longer or shorter than two standard deviations from the mean, and ambiguous bases (Ns) were filtered from the dataset by the Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009; Hurwitz et al., 2013) . Reads 1 and 2 from the same fragment were subsequently merged. Since duplicate reads sharing 100% nucleotide similarity and identical length may represent sequencing artifact, the filtered reads were treated by digital normalization to systematize the data coverage, thereby decreasing the sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors (Brown et al., 2012) . Metagenomic sequences were compared using the DIAMOND BLASTX (Buchfink et al., 2015) against the NCBI-nr database of non-redundant protein sequences (as of March 2015). BLASTX matches to prokaryote genes (Bacteria and Archaea) above a bit score of 60 and a minimum length of 50 bp were retained and evaluated according to functional categories based on the SEED classification of functional roles and subsystems (Overbeek et al., 2005) . The taxonomic composition of protein-coding genes was determined using the MEtaGenome ANalyzer 5 (Huson et al., 2011) based on the annotations of BLASTX-identified genes in accordance with the NCBI taxonomy. To further evaluate genes involved in methane metabolism, degradation of lignocellulose and chitin, fermentation, hydrogen production and consumption, dissimilatory metal reduction, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation, dissimilatory nitrogen reduction, and nitrogen fixation, a list of key enzymes/functional genes (Supplementary Table S2 ) was searched against the results of BLASTX matching coding genes in the NCBI-nr database (the bit score is above 60 and the minimum length is 50 bp) by custom scripting. Since genes responsible for metal reduction have not been well determined, four genes including cytochrome c peroxidase (macA), sigma-54-dependent transcriptional response regulator (pilR), cytochrome C biogenesis protein (ppcA), and doubled CXXCH motif (CxxCH) were targeted to investigate the potential capability of metal reduction (Beliaev and Saffarini, 1998; Butler et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014) . A customized database composed of available complete genomes of methanogens and partial genomes of ANME groups was used for the annotation and determination of their taxonomy and relative abundances of genes related to methanogenesis and AOM. Genes used for these analyses are the key genes (including mcr, mtr, fwd, mch, mer, and mtd) for methanogenesis (Thauer, 2011) . Additionally, multi-heme cytochrome (MHC) genes with predicted S-layer domains from reconstructed ANME-2a genomes (ANME-2a: 2566125052 and 2566123487) (McGlynn et al., 2015) were tagged to represent the potential for direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). Gene-centric analysis was used to reveal differences in community functional capacity (Gill et al., 2006) . First, 37 single-copy housekeeping genes (Supplementary Table S3 ) were used to evaluate whether any metagenome was over-or underrepresented by the sequencing bias (He et al., 2015) . To do this, the odds ratios were calculated by dividing the abundances of specific single-copy genes in individual metagenomes with those in a combined average metagenome. For odds ratios around one, the sequencing bias for obtained metagenomes was minimal. The odds ratios of the abundances of individual functional genes in individual metagenomes to that in the combined average metagenome were used to compare gene abundances across samples and displayed with a heat map using the R ""gplots"" package. The average gene length based on the full-length opening reading frames from sequenced genomes deposited on NCBI (Supplementary Table S2 ) and the total number of reads matching coding genes in the NCBI-nr database in each sample (Supplementary Table S1 ) were first used to normalize the number of each functional gene (Supplementary Table S2 ). Then, the number of sequences matching the universal, putative singlecopy gene encoding RNA polymerase subunit B (rpoB, 4020 bp) was used to normalize the sequence count of target genes. A value equal to one indicates that the abundance of specific genes in the metagenome is equivalent to that of rpoB. All sequence data generated in this study are publicly available in the NCBI database under the BioProject accession PRJNA386622. A small portion of collected mud slurries was drained and the headspace was replaced with 100% methane at ∼1.5 bar. The bottle was kept at room temperature in an anoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, United States) for pre-incubation for 3 days to reduce any possible oxygen interference and stimulate the activity of anaerobic methane oxidizer. The basal salt solution was prepared in accordance with the general geochemical characteristics of the site following the recipe reported in Cheng et al. (2014) with a chloride concentration adjusted to 500 mM. The reducing agent (Na 2 S × 9H 2 O) at a final concentration of 2.08 mM was added into the sterilized basal salt solution to decrease the redox potential and remove any trace amount of oxygen. The basal salt medium was sulfate free and did not contain any carbon source or electron acceptor. For every set of incubations, slurries were mixed with an equal volume of basal salt and capped with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum rings. Triplicate bottles were supplemented with sulfate (10 mM), nitrate (5 mM), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, 1 mM), ferrihydrite (10 mM), fumarate (1 mM), ferrihydrite with AQDS (10 and 1 mM), ferrihydrite with fumarate (10 and 1 mM), or no exogenous electron acceptors (Supplementary Table S4 ). Ferrihydrite was synthesized by neutralizing a 0.4 M solution of ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Lovley and Phillips, 1986) . The headspace gas was first exchanged in three cycles of vacuum and 0.22-µm filtered nitrogen with an end pressure of 1.01 bar. Then, 2 mL of 99.99% 13 CH 4 (Campro Scientific, Veenendaal, Netherlands) was injected into the headspace of each vial to provide a concentration of ∼1.82 × 10 4 ppmv. Additionally, two sets of controls were prepared. One was a nitrogen control (slurries mixed with nitrogen at 1.01 bar in the headspace), whereas the other was a sterilized control prepared with autoclave-sterilized slurries and 13 CH 4 in duplicate. In total, eight sets of incubations and two controls were performed under dark conditions at room temperature. The pH of resultant mixture was measured using the pH test strip and ranged from 7 to 8. The total amounts of 13 CO 2 in headspace and its isotopic compositions were monitored at a 30−55 day interval using a gas chromatography in line with a MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The headspace concentration was used to calculate the equilibrium concentration of DIC using the Henry's law constant (Stumm and Morgan, 1996) . The total moles of 13 CO 2 in headspace and dissolved form were summed and plotted against time duration of incubation. Methane oxidation rates were calculated by applying a linear regression on the accumulated amount of 13 CO 2 versus the time interval. The calculation assumed that all the produced 13 CO 2 in headspace was in equilibrium with the dissolved form and was solely derived from AOM. To compare whether the AOM rate of a specific treatment was significantly different from that for the sterilized control, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted.  Geochemical profiles of pore water showed various characteristics related to abiotic and microbial processes (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S5 ). Chloride concentrations ranged between 274 and 532 mM, with most data clustering between 350 and 400 mM and great fluctuations occurring at 7.5, 37.5, and 130-140 cm depth. Dissolved manganese and iron concentrations decreased with depth, with low values observed generally below 60 cm. Concentrations of sulfate and other major anions were below the detectable level. Methane concentrations increased from 0.39 to 1.57 mM with increasing depth. Carbon isotopic compositions of methane decreased from −49 at the core top to −59 at 25 cm and increased gradually to −55 at the core bottom. DOC concentrations were low (between 1 and 2.3 mM) at <72.5 cm and increased to above 2.5 mM at >72.5 cm. For comparison, DIC concentrations decreased from 1.9 to 1.1 mM with depth. The δ 13 C values of DIC generally increased from −5.4 at the core top to −0.2 at 107.5 cm and decreased to −4.3 at the core bottom. Abundances of all investigated taxonomic groups varied by two to three orders of magnitude along depth (Figure 1) . The bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances ranged between 7.33 × 10 5 and 4.61 × 10 7 copies (g −1 of sediments). Along depth, the copies of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were the lowest in the bubbling pool, increased to a maximum of 4.61 × 10 7 copies (g −1 of sediments) at 17.5 cm, and then exhibited a decline of one to two orders of magnitude toward the core bottom. The abundances of archaeal 16S rRNA genes ranged between 8.39 × 10 5 and 1.19 × 10 8 copies (g −1 of sediments), whereas the abundances of ANME-2a 16S rRNA genes varied from 1.67 × 10 5 to 1.41 × 10 7 copies (g −1 of sediments). Their variations were generally comparable with those of bacteria. The number of observed OTUs was the highest in the bubbling pool, decreased dramatically from the core top to the depth of 7.5 cm, and increased toward the bottom of the core (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ). The trends of the Chao1 estimator and Inverse Simpson indices resembled the pattern of observed OTUs, with the highest values of both richness and evenness occurring in the bubbling pool (Supplementary Figure S1) . Environmental vectors were fitted onto the ordination of NMDS (Figure 2A) . The projections were significantly correlated with the concentrations of Fe (R 2 = 0.60, P < 0.05), methane (R 2 = 0.48, P < 0.05) or δ 13 C values of CH 4 (R 2 = 0.50, P < 0.05). Communities from 2.5, 7.5, and 12.5 cm (high dissolved Fe concentrations and δ 13 C values of CH 4 ) were clearly separated from communities from 107.5, 127.5, and 157.5 cm (high concentrations of methane) along the first axis (Figure 2A) . A total of 18,401 bacterial and 3,510 archaeal OTUs (97% similarity), representing 157 classes (140 bacterial and 17 archaeal) within 44 phyla were recovered from all samples, with per sample OTU counts ranging from 1,622 to 6,207 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The dominant phyla include Proteobacteria (α, β, and γ divisions), Euryarchaeota, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria (∼79% of all sequences; Figure 2B) . Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, OP8, Thaumarchaeota, JS1, Spirochaetes, and OD1 were present at a lower abundance (∼7% of all sequences). The majority of bacterial reads were assigned to the orders Desulfuromonadales (14.8%) and Desulfobacterales (7.7%) within Deltaproteobacteria (Supplementary Table S6 ). Most sequences matching Desulfuromonadales were related to the families Sva1033, Desulfuromonadaceae, and Geobacteraceae. In particular, sequences affiliated with Desulfuromonadaceae constituted 26-29% of sequences in each sample at 2.5-12.5 cm depths, where methane concentrations were low and dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations were high. The dominant OTUs were classified to Sva1033 (Supplementary Table S7 ) and their abundances were highly correlated with the dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations (ρ = 0.78 and 0.75, respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, the majority of archaeal reads (18% of all reads) were assigned to the order Methanosarcinales within Methanomicrobia and primarily related to ANME-2 clades (9-36% in each sample) ( Figure 2B and Supplementary  Table S6 ). Most sequences (>98%) related to ANME-2 were phylogenetically assigned to the ANME-2a/2b group. The remaining 1% of ANME-2 related sequences shared 93% similarity with the nitrate-reducing anaerobic methane oxidizer, Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens (Haroon et al., 2013) . A few other sequences shared 99% similarity with the freshwater subgroup of ANME-1 from terrestrial subsurface environments in Japan (Takeuchi et al., 2011) and 97% similarity with ANME1b from MVs in southwestern Taiwan . A proportion of archaeal sequences were related to Methanobacteriales, Methanococcales, Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales, and Methanocellales. Their abundances were low at shallow depths (∼1% from the surface to the depth of 17.5 cm) and became abundant (5-8%) at depth intervals between 67.5 and 107.5 cm (Supplementary Figure S2a and Table S6 ). The dominant OTUs shared 99% and 97% similarity with Methanocalculus pumilus and Methanosarcina semesiae, respectively (Supplementary Table S7) . Sequences matching Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Thaumarchaeota were abundant in samples with methane concentrations lower than 1 mM. Within Gammaproteobacteria, distinct families dominated at different depths. For example, Methylomicrobium-related sequences (within Methylococcales) were primarily distributed in the bubbling pool, whereas Marinobacter-related sequences (within Alteromonadales) were abundant in the core samples (Supplementary Tables S6, S7 ). For comparison, dominant phyla in samples with methane concentrations above 1 mM include Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi (Anaerolineae), and Firmicutes (Figure 2) . Among these phyla, sequences affiliated with Prolixibacter denitrificans MIC1-1 (96% identity) within Bacteroidetes constituted 18% of total reads and represent the dominant OTUs at 87.5 cm (Supplementary Table S7 ). Sequences of the other major OTUs were related to Demequina spp. ER-8 within Actinobacteria, Thermotomaculum hydrothermale strain AC55 within Acidobacteria, uncultured Ardenticatenia within Chloroflexi, and uncultured Clostridiales within Firmicutes (Supplementary Table S7 ). A total of 0.8-1.7 million sequences per sample were obtained for further metagenomics analysis, and 21-32% of the sequences from each sample (373,020-769,841 reads per sample; Supplementary Table S1) were assigned to specific genes. A total of 28-34% of these annotated genes matched prokaryotic genes in the SEED (Supplementary Table S1 ). The majority of reads (>99%) were derived from prokaryotes (Supplementary Table S1 ). Therefore, protein coding sequences of prokaryotes were the main focus ( Figure 3A) . The odds ratios of specific single-copy genes in individual metagenomes to the average metagenome varied between 0.6 and 1.4 (Supplementary Figure S3) . With the exceptions for some genes from 2.5 and 87.5 cm, most odds ratios were between 0.8 and 1.2. These results suggest that the sequencing bias is limited and the obtained metagenomes could be used to address the abundance variations. The abundances of key enzymes/functional genes were variable along depth ( Figure 3B) . Of all gene systems, AOM, fermentation and hydrolysis, and metal reduction were the most abundant (Supplementary Figure S4) . The abundances of most investigated genes could not be differentiated statistically in accordance with the methane abundance category. Abundances of the genes mmo/pmo in the bubbling pool and top sediments were above the average for all depths ( Figure 3B ). The majority of the genes mmo/pmo were affiliated with Methylobacter spp. (sharing 80-96% identity) and Methylohalobius crimeensis (sharing 80-98% identity) within Methylococcaceae (Supplementary Table S8 ). The abundances of the genes mcr, mtr, fwd, mch, mer, and mtd affiliated with ANME members were highest in the bubbling pool and above the average at 27.5 and 47.5 cm ( Figure 3B ). These genes shared 80-95% similarity with the ANME-2a collected from Capt Aryutinov MV (Wang F.-P. et al., 2014) , and constituted the majority of archaeal reads (∼10% of all reads). In contrast, the same set of genes affiliated with methanogens (mostly Methanosarcinales) was more abundant at 87.5 and 127.5 cm than the average for all depths (Figure 3B ). Sequences representing two MHC genes with predicted S-layer domains were detected in seven samples and shared 60-80% similarity with ANME-2a. However, the relative abundances of the two genes were not particularly high (0.03-0.05%). Genes ak and pta (for synthesis of acetate from acetyl-CoA), genes adh and ldh (for production of alcohol and lactate), and gene hydA (for H 2 production) were more abundant at 87.5 cm than the average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . In contrast, gene acs (for acetate synthesis from acetyl-CoA) and gene hydB (for the oxidation of H 2 ) were more abundant in the bubbling pool than the average for all depths. Most of these reads were affiliated with Clostridium (for gene ak), Desulfuromonas (for gene pta), Bacillus (for gene adh), Gluconobacter (for gene ldh), Candidatus M. nitroreducens (for gene acs), Halanaerobium saccharolyticum (for gene hydA), and Geobacter spp. (for gene hydB) (Supplementary Table S8 ). MacA represents an intermediate carrier between electron transfer components in the inner and outer membranes (Butler et al., 2004) . Its abundances in the bubbling pool and at 2.5, 47.5, and 127.5 cm were above the average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . In contrast, the abundances of genes pilR, which encodes an enhancer binding protein involved in Fe(III) respiratory functions, and ppcA, an intermediary carrier for electron transport from acetate to terminal Fe(III) reductases in the outer membrane (Lloyd et al., 2006; Juárez et al., 2009) , and genes containing CxxCH heme-binding motif at 2.5, 17.5, and 27.5 cm were above the average for all depths (Figure 3B) . Most reads of pilR, ppcA, and CxxCH were affiliated with Geobacter (for macA and pilR), Geoalkalibacter (for macA), Desulfuromonas (for CxxH) and Pelobacter (for macA) within Desulfuromonadales (Supplementary Table S8 ). Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was inferred from the genes aprA [for conversions of adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to AMP and sulfite], sat (for conversions of activated sulfate to APS), and dsrAB (for reduction of sulfite to sulfide) ( Figure 3B ). The abundances of aprA, dsrAB, and sat at 17.5 cm were above the average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . Less than 3% of sequences encoding aprA were related to sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and 37% to AprA lineages I, 20% to Desulfobacteraceae, and 40% to Desulfobulbaceae. Reads of dsrAB were primarily related to Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfobacteraceae within Desulfobacterales. Additionally, 25% of dsrAB reads were affiliated with Peptococcaceae within Clostridiales (Supplementary Table S8 ). Reads of reverse dsrAB involved in aerobic and photosynthetic sulfur oxidation (Eisen et al., 2002; Ghosh and Dam, 2009; Loy et al., 2009) were affiliated with Thiothrix and Halorhodospira, respectively, and accounted for ∼4% of all dsrAB reads. The abundances of sulfur oxidation gene system (soxABYX) in the bubbling pool and at 2.5 and 17.5 cm were above average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . These reads shared 60-80% identity with Thiolapillus brandeum (Supplementary Table S8 ) isolated from the Okinawa Trough (Nunoura et al., 2014) . For dissimilatory nitrate reduction, the abundances of gene narG (which encodes the membrane-bound nitrate reductase) at 17.5 and 87.5 cm were above the average for all depths, whereas those of gene napA (which encodes the periplasmic nitrate reductase) at 2.5 and 17.5 cm were above the average for all depths. Both types of nitrite reductase (nirB and nrf A) catalyzing the reduction of nitrite to ammonium were more abundant at 2.5 and 17.5 cm than the average for all depths. Although diverse narG genes were detected, the majority of narG reads were affiliated with Marinobacter spp. (Supplementary  Table S8 ). The abundances of nif genes for di-nitrogen fixation in the bubbling pool and at 2.5 cm were above the average for all depths (Figure 3B) . Reads of nif genes (nif D, nif H, and nif K) were related with a variety of microorganisms and the majority were affiliated with Methanosarcina and Methanolobus (Supplementary Table S8 ). Most incubations yielded a steady increase of the accumulated 13 CO 2 with time (R 2 > 0.5; Supplementary Figure S5) . In contrast, the nitrogen control and incubations with ferrihydrite/AQDS, ferrihydrite/fumarate, and nitrate were characterized by different degrees of fluctuations in 13 CO 2 amount over time. Therefore, the rates derived from the regression analyses were calculated for individual incubations. High AOM activities at rates between 9.8 × 10 −4 and 1.2 × 10 −3 µmol cm −3 d −1 and between 7.6 × 10 −4 and 8.5 × 10 −4 µmol cm −3 d −1 were obtained for the incubations without exogenous electron acceptors and the ones supplied with sulfate, respectively ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S5) . In the presence of ferrihydrite, fumarate and AQDS, the rates ranged from 4.8 × 10 −4 to 5.2 × 10 −4 , from 1.6 × 10 −4 to 4.9 × 10 −4 , and from 1.9 × 10 −5 to 4.7 × 10 −4 µmol cm −3 d −1 , respectively. With the exceptions for one individual incubation with fumarate and AQDS, these rates were statistically different from the average rate of the sterilized control (1.5 × 10 −4 µmole cm −3 d −1 ) (P < 0.05). In contrast, in the presence of ferrihydrite/AQDS, ferrihydrite/fumarate, and nitrate, the 13 CO 2 was produced at a rate statistically no different from the sterilized control, and therefore considered negligible. The copy numbers of ANME-2a increased in the incubations with no exogenous electron acceptor (1.50 × 10 5 copies g −1 of slurries), sulfate (9.04 × 10 4 copies g −1 of slurries) and ferrihydrite (1.03 × 10 5 copies g −1 of slurries) when compared with the nitrogen control ( Figure 4B) . The copy numbers of ANME-2a in other incubations were either marginally higher or less than that in the nitrogen control. The two-dimensional PCoA plot revealed that communities clustered primarily by the addition of electron acceptors (Supplementary Figure S2b) . The community at the start of incubation was more similar to the communities in the bubbling pool and sediment core, and the addition of electron acceptors and methane shifted community compositions by various degrees after incubation for 176 days ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2b) . Desulfobacterales members appear to be the major group for the incubations without exogenous electron acceptors, or with sulfate or AQDS. The dominant OTU in these incubations was classified into the genus Desulfurivibrio (Supplementary Table S9 ) and shared 90% similarity with Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus (AHT2) from a soda lake in Egypt (NR_074971.1). The incubations supplied with fumarate or ferrihydrite/fumarate were characterized by abundant reads sharing 98% similarity with Pelobacter massiliensis (HHQ7) ( Supplementary Table S9 ), a strict anaerobe capable of fermenting l,2,4-trihydroxybenzene to acetate and reducing oxidized metal (Schnell et al., 1991) . The dominant OTU in the incubations supplied with ferrihydrite or nitrate shared 93% similarity with the uncultured clone (AB247832) collected from hydrothermal vents in Lau Basin. ANME-2a/2b reads dominated the archaeal communities in all incubations ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2a) . Reads affiliated with Methanococcus spp. and Methanosaeta spp. were abundant in the incubations without exogenous electron acceptors and those supplied with fumarate, respectively. For the other incubations, the proportion of methanogens was lower than 1% of total reads (Supplementary Figure S3) . Figure S4 . * symbol denotes the AOM rates significantly different from the sterilized control (P < 0.05).  The methane, DIC, and isotopic profiles are consistent with the compartmentalization of methane metabolisms at discrete depth intervals. At depths shallower than 20 cm, low methane concentrations, greater δ 13 C values of CH 4 , high DIC concentrations, and low δ 13 C values of DIC indicate the presence of methane oxidation. At the deeper intervals, the contrasting geochemical characteristics point to the predominance of methanogenesis over methane oxidation. Furthermore, dissolved Mn and Fe are generally dominated by their reduced forms [Mn(II) and Fe(II)] under near-neutral pH. Their high concentrations in the top portion of the core suggests that the pore water has to be anoxic. Methane oxidation prevailing at these intervals would be anaerobic. Resembling the findings of previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) , methane concentrations were inversely correlated with Fe/Mn concentrations (ρ = -0.65 and −0.65, respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, the δ 13 C values of CH 4 and the concentrations of dissolved Mn and Fe showed a strong covariance (ρ = 0.71 and 0.69, respectively, P < 0.05). These geochemical characteristics mark the transition of Fe/Mn to methane at depths of less than 20 cm, suggesting that AOM might be linked directly or indirectly to microbial manganese/iron reduction through a pathway that remains uncharacterized thoroughly Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . Interpretation with regard to AOM and related metabolisms based on geochemical evidence is comparable with that based on molecular evidence obtained from this and previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . The copy numbers of ANME-2a 16S rRNA genes were enhanced greatly at the methane transition intervals (<20 cm) (Figure 1) . Furthermore, genes responsible for the AOM processes, including mcr, mtr, fwd, mch, mer, and mtd, were all recovered from metagenomic data and phylogenetically classified into the ANME-2a lineage (Supplementary Figure S6) . These lines of evidence combined with positive AOM activities derived from incubation experiments (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S5 ) and geochemical characteristics (Figure 1) suggest that the anoxic sediments near the surface harbored substantial amounts of anaerobic methane oxidizers that actively oxidized methane produced at the adjacent depth intervals. Of all the incubation sets, the rate of AOM without exogenous electron acceptors appeared to be the fastest (Figure 4A) . The results suggest that AOM could proceed with the reduction of electron acceptors within sediments. Considering that sulfate and nitrate in pore water and the bubbling pool were below the detection, their abundances in the incubated slurries would be further diluted by the basal solution added. Therefore, the most plausible electron acceptor, if any, would be the oxidized iron associated with sediments. This inference is, however, not supported by the lower AOM rates obtained from the incubations with synthetic ferrihydrite when compared with the rates for treatments without an exogenous electron acceptor. Previous studies indicate that ferrihydrite is the least crystalline form of iron oxide commonly observed in natural samples (Waite et al., 1994) and, therefore, has the greatest bioreactivity for microbial iron reduction. If ferric iron is the target electron acceptor, AOM would have to use the solid form distinct from the ferrihydrite supplemented with incubations. Mineralogical investigations are warranted to attest this assertion. The AOM activities detected for incubations (excluding ferrihydrite/AQDS, ferrihydrite/fumarate, and nitrate) also suggest that a wide range of electron acceptors could at least maintain the viability of ANME-2a members to various degrees (Figure 4) . The results are partially comparable with the previous study in which sulfate, AQDS, ferric citrate, ferrihydrite, humic acids, and melanin could feasibly stimulate AOM activity in sediments retrieved from a marine seep and a canal (Ettwig et al., 2016; Scheller et al., 2016) . Our results additionally suggest that no exogenous addition, and additions of fumarate were also candidate treatments to facilitate the AOM. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene analysis conducted for incubated slurries yielded a predominance of ANME-2a members for positive AOM incubations (Supplementary Figure S3) . The ANME-2a members have been experimentally demonstrated to exploit AQDS alone or to form syntrophic partnerships with Deltaproteobacteria for sulfate reduction (Scheller et al., 2016) . The capability of ANME-2a members in exploiting all the other electron acceptors tested in this study has not been confirmed in previous studies. Geochemical characteristics indicated that iron and manganese reduction prevailed in the top 40 cm of sediments (Figure 1) . Such inferences were further supported by the results that Desulfuromonadales within Deltaproteobacteria constituted the most abundant order based on the 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses. Its abundances were positively correlated with the concentrations of dissolved Mn and Fe. Strains belonging to Desulfuromonadales are known to be capable of catalyzing anaerobic respiration with nitrate, elemental sulfur, ferrihydrite, or manganese oxide as electron acceptors (Köpke et al., 2005; Greene et al., 2009; Summers et al., 2010; Greene, 2014) . Members within Desulfuromonadales, such as Geobacter, rely on the outer membrane c-type cytochromes to transfer electrons to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides (Lovley, 1993; Mehta et al., 2005) . The great abundances of c-type cytochrome encoded genes (macA, ppcA, and CxxCH) phylogenetically affiliated with Geobacter and Pelobacter further revealed the prevalence of metal reduction at the top 40 cm (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S8 ). The coincidence of AOM and the metal reduction zone at similar depth intervals has been observed in this and previous studies for cores collected on different dates (2009 vs. 2010) . These results suggest the persistence of a possible linkage between AOM and metal reduction through time. AOM driven by iron reduction has only been experimentally demonstrated in enrichment cultures composed of 40-50% ""Candidatus M. nitroreducens"" of the ANME-2d group and 40% Methylomirabilis oxyfera of NC-10 phylum (Ettwig et al., 2016) . Additional incubations with M. oxyfera as the sole methane oxidizer did not yield the production of detectable ferrous iron, leading Ettwig et al. (2016) to conclude that AOM coupled with the production of ferrous iron was mediated solely by M. nitroreducens. However, the 16S rRNA genes related to M. nitroreducens constituted only a minor portion (<1%) of the total reads in any environmental or incubated samples described in this study (Supplementary Figure S3) , thereby precluding the attribution of the observed coincidence of AOM and metal reduction zone to the ANME-2d members. The enhanced abundances of ANME-2a and Desulfuromonadales in the metal-to-methane transition zone provides the possibility that these two populations might form syntrophic consortia to facilitate the electron transport during AOM. To date, DIET has been proposed as the principal mechanism to couple the electron transport from AOM to sulfate reduction (McGlynn et al., 2015; Wegener et al., 2015) . Through mining of ANME genomes and metagenomes, McGlynn et al. (2015) found that the genomes of ANME-2a/2b/2d groups encode large MHCs (up to 34 hemes). In particular, the MHCs of ANME-2 members were fused with the single putative S-layer domain. Such genetic organization together with cytochrome reactive staining and transmission electron microscopic observation led McGlynn et al. (2015) to propose that tandem proteins encoding formate dehydrogenase-related cytochrome b with MHCs and MHC/S-layer fusion proteins could be an effective route to facilitate interspecies transport of electrons generated from the oxidation of methane to the downstream product, reduced methanophenazine, thereby stabilizing syntrophic aggregate arrangements. It is likely that the MHC/S-layer fusion proteins might be also able to facilitate the reduction of metal oxides by ANME members without the need of metal reducers. Similarly, evidence from cultivation, expressions of genes (c-type cytochromes, mcrA, dsrA, and pilA), and visualization of microstructures has shown that the HotSeep-1 members could have produced nanowires, such as pili, extending to the surface of ANME-1 cells under the AOM conditions (Wegener et al., 2015) . Again, such structures provide a putative route that enables the DIET between anaerobic methane oxidizers and metal reducers, and might facilitate the formation of syntrophic consortia with loose contact between individual cells (Wegener et al., 2015) . The MHCs/S-layer fusion proteins of ANME-2a (McGlynn et al., 2015) were present in all metagenomes of LGHMVs. If the MHCs/S-layer fusion protein indeed accounts for the electron transfer for the detected ANME-2a, syntrophic consortia could form with the aid of possible interspecies electron transport through the mechanisms describe above. Alternatively, electrons generated from anaerobic methane oxidizers could be transferred directly to extracellular electron acceptors in a process similar to that conducted by G. sulfurreducens (Methé et al., 2003) and possibly by ANME-2d (Ettwig et al., 2016) . The exact interactions between the ANME and Desulfuromonadales members remain uncertain, as attempts to perform fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments were not successfully, likely due to the interference of sediment auto-fluorescence and low RNA content (unpublished results). Finally, 16S rRNA genes related to Methylomicrobium of Methylococcaceae appear to be abundant in the bubbling fluids (1.4%, compared to the lowest value of 0.04% at 47.5 cm). Similarly, the abundances of mmo were more abundant in the bubbling fluids than that in cored sediments. Most genes of mmo were affiliated with M. crimeensis within Methylococcaceae. Strains related to these genera are capable of oxidizing methane under oxic conditions. Since the bubbling fluids were generally thought to originate from mineral dehydration or sediment compaction at great depths, the fluids are regarded the least altered and representative of the reducing source condition. The presence of these aerobic methane oxidizers, however, suggests that atmospheric oxygen might be entrained into the pool fluids through gas bubbling at quantities sufficient to drive methane oxidation while outcompeting the kinetics of abiotic oxidation of other reducing compounds (e.g., ferrous iron). The oxygenation induced by gas bubbling has been observed in intertidal sediments near the seep (O'Hara et al., 1995) . Such a process would lead to a steeper redox gradient that facilitates the coexistence of metabolisms with a spectrum of oxygen affinities. Nevertheless, while methane emanating from the pool could be directly discharged into the atmosphere, the observed aerobic methane oxidizers could act as biological filters for methane discharge. For comparison, control of methane emitted from the mud platform adjacent to the pool would be primarily accounted for by the anaerobic methane oxidizers (e.g., ANME-2a members). A portion of DOC is formed through the hydrolysis and fermentation of organic matter catalyzed by microorganisms and fuels electron-accepting processes downstream the metabolic network. Therefore, DOC concentrations represent the interplay between the production and consumption processes mediated by different components of microbial populations. The low DOC concentration at shallow depth suggests that the production of DOC could have been efficiently channeled to metal reduction and perhaps AOM. In contrast, the high DOC concentration at deeper intervals suggests that the DOC cycling might not be as efficient as at shallow depths due to the production of different intermediate DOC compounds and/or the shift in microbial communities and functions. The enhanced proportions of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria, and the increased DOC concentrations at depth provide a link between the DOC accumulation and these taxonomic groups. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the dominant OTUs were affiliated with P. denitrificans, S. paucivorans, uncultured Ardenticatenia, and Demequina sp. ER-8. These closest strains are generally considered to be capable of degrading organic matter. For the degradation of specific categories of organic matter, the 16S rRNA gene sequences related to Mycobacterium within Actinobacteria and Fulvivirga within Bacteroidetes were inferred to represent community members capable of degrading chitin. Sequences 16S rRNA genes related to Prolixibacter within Bacteroidetes were inferred to represent community members capable of degrading plant-derived materials. Similarly, the greater abundances of genes rha, abf, and xyl compared to chi at depths between 77.5 and 97.5 cm were correlated with the increased concentrations of DOC, suggesting an enhanced capability for the decomposition of plant-derived materials primarily mediated by Bacteroidetes. Finally, the proliferation of fermenters, such as Clostridium, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus, which are known of being capable of synthesizing hydrocarbons from acetate, butyrate, and alcohol, might also contribute to the increased concentrations of DOC. Based on the classification of 16S rRNA amplicons (Supplementary Figures S2a) , the dominant methanogens at 67.5 cm were related to M. pumilus, a strain known for using H 2 /CO 2 for methane production (Mori et al., 2000) . In contrast, the abundances of acetoclastic Methanosaeta harundinacea (Rotaru et al., 2013) increased to be almost equal to those of M. pumilus at 87.5 cm. The variable proportions of methanogenrelated sequences along depth combined with methane isotopic compositions and DOC profiles suggest that that predominant methanogenic pathways (either CO 2 -reducing or acetoclastic) shifted at different depths, a metabolic scheme potentially driven by the end products from organic hydrolysis, degradation, and fermentation. The metagenomic results also indicated that reads classified to soxABYX system, aprA, and dsrAB were more abundant at 17.5 cm when compared with those at other depths. This combined with the detection of a small proportion of aprA genes taxonomically assigned to AprA lineage I composed of sulfur oxidizers, and Desulfocapsa sulfexigens capable of disproportionating inorganic sulfur compounds (Finster et al., 2013) , and abundant dsrAB genes assigned to Desulfobacterales and Desulfobulbaceae suggest that oxidative and reductive pathways of sulfur coexist at the depth interval geochemically interpreted as the anoxic zone. The coexistence of both sulfur oxidizers and sulfate reducers has been observed at depths below sulfate reduction zone, and inferred to catalyze the ""cryptic"" sulfur cycling based on the gene expression, rate measurement, and isotopic pattern (Wasmund et al., 2017) . It remains unclear whether such sulfur cycling also prevails at our investigated site. Patterns of geochemical characteristics, gene abundances and assemblages, and incubation responses suggest a wide range of metabolic capability and interactions for microbial communities thriving at the LGHMV. The metabolic interactions are primarily driven by the upstream degradation of complex organic matter (e.g., chitin and cellulose) and fermentation mediated by Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes at depth. Despite the fact that a portion of degradative and fermentative products in mobile phase are accumulated in pore water, some are further exploited by various methanogens, fueling downstream AOM processes catalyzed by the ANME2a members near the surface. While the AOM could be stimulated by a range of electron acceptors, their activity is intimately linked with iron reduction likely through intercellular electron transfer under the in situ conditions. The cascading transformation of organic carbon highlights the importance of the microbial metabolic network in cycling sediment-associated, recalcitrant organic matter and controlling methane emission in terrestrial ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MVs.

1587067,Diverse sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus clade are the key alkane degraders at marine seeps,"Biogeochemical and microbiological data indicate that the anaerobic oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has an important role in carbon and sulfur cycling at marine seeps. Yet, little is known about the bacterial hydrocarbon degraders active in situ. Here, we provide the link between previous biogeochemical measurements and the cultivation of degraders by direct identification of SRB responsible for butane and dodecane degradation in complex on-site microbiota. Two contrasting seep sediments from Mediterranean Amon mud volcano and Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) were incubated with (13)C-labeled butane or dodecane under sulfate-reducing conditions and analyzed via complementary stable isotope probing (SIP) techniques. Using DNA- and rRNA-SIP, we identified four specialized clades of alkane oxidizers within Desulfobacteraceae to be distinctively active in oxidation of short- and long-chain alkanes. All clades belong to the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) clade, substantiating the crucial role of these bacteria in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation at marine seeps. The identification of key enzymes of anaerobic alkane degradation, subsequent β-oxidation and the reverse Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for complete substrate oxidation by protein-SIP further corroborated the importance of the DSS clade and indicated that biochemical pathways, analog to those discovered in the laboratory, are of great relevance for natural settings. The high diversity within identified subclades together with their capability to initiate alkane degradation and growth within days to weeks after substrate amendment suggest an overlooked potential of marine benthic microbiota to react to natural changes in seepage, as well as to massive hydrocarbon input, for example, as encountered during anthropogenic oil spills.","Hydrocarbons are widespread on Earth and can be oxidized by a variety of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms (e.g. reviewed by Head et al., 2006; Widdel et al., 2010) . Natural sources of hydrocarbons in marine systems are gas or oil seeps differing in hydrocarbon concentrations and composition. Marine gas seeps are, in general, dominated by high concentrations of methane (mM-mM range), whereas propane and butane are commonly found only in traces (mM range). In contrast, other marine hydrocarbon seeps contain a broad range of alkanes, alkenes and aromatic compounds (e.g. Anderson et al., 1983; Bazylinski et al., 1988) . While degradation of hydrocarbons is well studied under oxic conditions (Head et al., 2006; Kinnaman et al., 2007; Prince et al., 2010; Redmond et al., 2010; Gutierrez et al., 2013) and numerous bacterial and fungal degraders have been described (Shennan, 2006) , knowledge about anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation and responsible organisms is still limited. The anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation has been reported to occur under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, iron-reducing and methanogenic conditions (for a review see Widdel et al., 2010) . In marine systems, degradation under sulfate-reducing conditions is of great importance owing to the high availability of sulfate as an electron acceptor. A large fraction of sulfate reduction (SR) at gas and hydrocarbon seeps is fueled by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM; for a review see Reeburgh, 2007) . However, the major part of total SR is likely to be fueled by the oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons (for an overview see Bowles et al., 2011) with a considerable impact on local carbon and sulfur cycling. The oxidation of non-methane alkanes with sulfate has recently been reported to occur across a range of temperatures in diverse marine and terrestrial seeps or vents (e.g. Joye et al., 2004; Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Orcutt et al., 2010; Savage et al., 2010; Quistad and Valentine, 2011; Jaekel et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2013; Bose et al., 2013) . Measured rates of alkane degradation and SR closely followed stoichiometric predictions that assume complete oxidation of alkanes to CO 2 (e.g. see Quistad and Valentine, 2011; Bose et al., 2013) . Reported rates for anaerobic short-chain alkane (SCA) oxidation were high in alkane-amended slurries of Gulf of Mexico or Middle Valley sediments (34-354 nmol C 2 -C 4 ml À 1 per day; Adams et al., 2013; Bose et al., 2013) . In situ anaerobic propane oxidation rates in fresh sediments from a gas seep located in the Santa Barbara Channel even exceeded rates from the batch cultures with up to 2100 nmol propane cm À 3 per day (Quistad and Valentine, 2011) . The rates were comparably high to those reported for AOM in similar environments (e.g. Joye et al., 2004, Knittel and Boetius, 2009 ) suggesting the anaerobic oxidation of SCAs as an important process at marine gas seeps (Quistad and Valentine, 2011; Bose et al., 2013) , despite C 2 -C 5 alkanes typically present at much lower concentrations than methane. Most cultivated or enriched sulfate-reducing hydrocarbon degraders are widespread within the class Deltaproteobacteria (Figure 1 ). Yet, the only pure culture shown to degrade SCAs is strain BuS5 (Kniemeyer et al., 2007) , capable of growth on propane and butane. It is phylogenetically affiliated with the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) clade belonging to the family Desulfobacteraceae. The DSS clade was defined based on the coverage of probe DSS658 (Manz et al., 1998) that is widely used for in situ detection and quantification of these organisms. Besides strain BuS5, DSS comprises organisms that have been shown to dominate propane-and n-pentane-degrading enrichments from a terrestrial hydrocarbon seep , or enrichments from Gulf of Mexico or Hydrate Ridge seep sediments degrading C 2 -C 4 alkanes (Jaekel et al., 2012; Bose et al., 2013) . In addition to SCA degraders, DSS comprises degraders of mid-chain or long-chain alkanes (LCAs), alkenes or aromatic compounds, such as toluene or naphthalene (e.g. Aeckersberg et al., 1998; Harms et al., 1999; So and Young, 1999; Meckenstock et al., 2000) . Further hydrocarbon-degrading sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can be found within non-DSS Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae, Syntrophobacteraceae and Desulfurellales (Widdel et al., 2010 ; Figure 1 ). Of these, Desulfurellales might be of particular interest as it comprises a broad diversity of organisms dominating anaerobic batch reactor incubations of sediments from the Middle Valley hydrothermal vent field , as well as the sulfate-reducing partner bacteria of ANME-1-mediating thermophilic AOM in Guaymas Basin (GB) sediments (Holler et al., 2011) . Only few non-deltaproteobacterial SRB capable of degrading hydrocarbons are known and belong to the phylum Firmicutes, that is, Desulfosporosinus sp. strain Y5 (Liu et al., 2004) and Desulfotomaculum sp. strain OX39 (Morasch et al., 2004) . All strains available in pure culture can usually degrade only a restricted range of hydrocarbons, for example, few aliphatic hydrocarbons within a narrow range of chain length (e.g. C 3 -C 4 or C 6 -C 10 or C 12 -C 20 ) or few aromatic compounds. In situ analysis of SRB communities at numerous marine gas and oil seeps indicated a high abundance and diversity of DSS with 10% to 460% of total cells (e.g. Orphan et al., 2001; Orcutt et al., 2010; Schreiber et al., 2010; Kleindienst et al., 2012) . Potentially, the DSS clade is one of the most relevant lineages for hydrocarbon degradation in marine sediments, and could thus be of utmost relevance not only at natural hydrocarbon seeps but also upon catastrophic events. Still, the ecology and niche partitioning between these hydrocarbon degraders is quite poorly understood in situ, and studies directly linking functional information from both the lab and the field data are not available. Here, we aim at closing the gap between previous cultivationdependent studies (i.e. isolates) and biogeochemical rate measurements in situ (i.e. hydrocarbon turnover). We studied two types of anoxic sediments from contrasting natural hydrocarbon seep environments: the GB hydrocarbon seep sediment was selected as a representative for a habitat with changing natural conditions characterized by the presence of steep gradients of temperature and electron acceptors, as well as seepage of a broad spectrum of hydrocarbons including alkanes oC 20 . In contrast, the Amon mud volcano (AMV) located in the Mediterranean Sea was selected as a representative for a more stable natural seep environment that is characterized by constant temperatures and a narrow range of hydrocarbons (gaseous alkanes C 1 -C 5 ). Sediments were incubated under sulfate-reducing conditions with 13 C-labeled butane as a model substrate for a gas leakage and 13 C-labeled dodecane as a model substrate for an oil spill. We hypothesized (i) that the DSS clade indeed dominates hydrocarbon degradation in situ, and (ii) that niche partitioning of DSS subclades occurs based on alkane chain length. A combination of DNA-, RNA-and protein-based stable isotope probing (SIP) enabled us to identify distinct clades of active SRB, respectively, involved in alkane degradation. These specialized degraders may catalyze a major Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree showing the affiliations of 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from incubations of AMV and GB sediments with 13 C-labeled butane or dodecane with selected reference sequences of the Deltaproteobacteria. A consensus tree based on the obtained maximum-likelihood (PhyML) tree is shown. A selection of gammaproteobacterial sequences was used as outgroup. Partial sequences were inserted into the reconstructed tree by using parsimony criteria. Entries corresponding to T-RFs of identified 13 C-labeled alkane degraders are shown in red, and other sequences from the incubations are shown in blue. Sequences of cultivated anaerobic hydrocarbon degraders (black, boldface type) were included as additional reference; their substrate usage is given within parentheses. Probe coverage is indicated by gray-colored boxes. Scale bar represents 10% estimated sequence divergence. Anaerobic alkane oxidation at marine seeps S Kleindienst et al part of the SR-dependent non-methane hydrocarbon degradation in marine sediments. Study sites and sampling Anoxic sediments were collected from the active AMV and a hydrocarbon seep at GB during the cruises MSM13-3 (RV Maria S. Merian) and AT15-56 (RV Atlantis) in 2009. AMV is located in the Nile deep-sea fan and comprises large subsurface gas reservoirs . Sampling was carried out with the remotely operated vehicle Quest 4000 during dive 240 at station 929 (PANGAEA database event MSM13/3_929-1; water depth 1122 m, 32120.1321N, 31142.6543E). The sediments derived from an area surrounding the central dome and were covered by a microbial mat. For details see Felden et al. (2013) . GB is located in the central Gulf of California and harbors petroleum-rich hydrothermal sediments, covered with layers of buried sedimentary organic matter. Hydrothermal fluids contain elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons, including alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons (Bazylinski et al., 1988; Didyk and Simoneit, 1989) . Fine-grained sediments below a white Beggiatoa mat were collected during dive 4573 (water depth 2010 m, 2710.696N, 111124.265W) with the submersible Alvin. Setup of incubations for SIP Sediments were stored for 4 months at 4 1C. During this time period, preincubations were carried out to identify sediments with highest alkane-degrading microbial activities based on sulfide and 13 CO 2 production. Slurries were prepared in an anoxic tent (N 2 :CO 2 , 9:1 v/v ) by mixing sediments from 2 to 20 cm (AMV) and 0 to 10 cm (GB) depth in a 1:1 ratio with artificial sea water (Widdel and Bak, 1992) , using a sterile metal spoon. During further processing and preparation of incubations, samples were always maintained under anoxic conditions at room temperature. Sediment slurries were further distributed in 15 ml aliquots in 22-ml tubes sealed with butyl rubber stoppers, under a headspace of N 2 :CO 2 . Either fully 13 C-labeled or unlabeled butane were added to the headspace, using N 2 -purged gastight syringes. 13 C-labeled and unlabeled dodecane were injected into the tubes using N 2 -flushed glass syringes. Hydrocarbon concentrations in our experiments (2.1 mM butane; 1.8 mM dodecane) exceeded the natural concentrations by 4100-fold to prevent substrate availability limitations in SIP. Butane is a natural substrate at both seep types occurring in concentrations of 0.5-1.1 mM (AMV) and 6-16 mM (GB, at a site close by; MY Kellermann, personal communication). Dodecane has only been detected at hydrocarbon seeps in the GB (Bazylinski et al., 1988) . AMV sediments were incubated at 20 1C, which is slightly above the in situ temperature of 14 1C, whereas for GB sediments, where the temperature range is wider (from 3 1C to 50 1C), 28 1C was chosen. For each site (AMV, GB) and substrate (unlabeled butane, 13 C-labeled butane, unlabeled dodecane, 13 C-labeled dodecane), six replicate tubes were incubated. Time points for DNA and RNA extraction were chosen based on sulfide production (Figure 2a ). For these analyses, two of the replicate tubes were used for each time point. Sediments were centrifuged (10 min, 4000 g) and pellets stored at À 80 1C. One tube each was used for nucleic acid-SIP and one for protein-SIP. For catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) analysis, 0.5 ml of incubated sediment slurries were fixed for 1 h at 4 1C with a final concentration of 1% paraformaldehyde, washed with 1 Â phosphate-buffered saline (130 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate; pH 7.2) and finally stored in phosphate-buffered salineethanol (1:1) at À 20 1C. Sulfide was quantified photometrically as colloidal CuS (Cord-Ruwisch, 1985) . For each of the two replicate incubations, two technical replicates were measured. Butane concentrations were measured by gas-chromatographic headspace analysis (oven 110 1C, injector 150 1C, detector 280 1C, nitrogen carrier gas) as described before (Musat and Widdel, 2008) . The C-isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from sediment slurries was analyzed using gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Fisons VG Optima) according to Assayag et al. (2006) . Biological activity of the DIC controls was halted by the addition of 4% paraformaldehyde (final concentration). In situ hybridization with horseradish peroxidaselabeled oligonucleotide probes followed by fluorescently labeled tyramide signal amplification (CARD) and microscopic counting was performed as described previously (Kleindienst et al., 2012) . Probes for alkane degraders were developed using the software package ARB and the implemented function 'probe design' (Ludwig et al., 2004) . The specificity of new probes was evaluated against reference strains having one or more mismatches. For probes SCA1-212a and b, we used strain BuS5 and GMe12, respectively, as a positive control. For probes SCA2, LCA1 and LCA2, stringent hybridization conditions were determined by Clone-FISH (Schramm et al., 2002) . Probe sequences and formamide concentrations required for specific hybridization are given in Supplementary Table S1 . DNA/RNA-SIP Nucleic acids were directly extracted from 3 to 4 g of incubated sediments and stored at À 80 1C. From AMV sediment incubations, RNA was extracted according to McIlroy et al. (2008) , whereas from GB sediments DNA was extracted according to Zhou et al. (1996) , because RNA extraction did not result in the required amounts of high-quality rRNA. Labeled and unlabeled nucleic acids (5 mg Guaymas-DNA and 750 ng AMV-rRNA) were loaded onto a CsCl gradient (average density 1.71 g ml À 1 ; Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or cesium trifluoroacetate (CsTFA; average density 1.795 g ml Anaerobic alkane oxidation at marine seeps S Kleindienst et al precipitation of nucleic acids was carried out as published before (Lueders, 2010) . Distribution of Guaymas-DNA or AMV-RNA within the gradients was analyzed using bacterial 16S rRNA genetargeted real-time polymerase chain reaction and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in an Mx3000P Cycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) with the primers Ba519f/Ba907r as described in . FAM-labeled amplicons for terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of selected densityresolved nucleic acids were generated with bacterial primers 27f/907r as described in detail elsewhere Pilloni et al., 2011) . Briefly, amplicons were digested with MspI (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and size-separated on an ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Further analysis was performed with T-REX (Culman et al., 2009) . Background noise filtering was on the default factor 1.2; the clustering threshold for aligning peaks across samples was set to 1.5 bp. Relative terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) abundance was inferred from peak heights. For reduction of data complexity, T-RFs that occurred in o10% of the samples were excluded from further analysis. AMV sediment frozen directly after sampling was used as a control. The resulting T-RF pattern was similar to the one obtained from the SIP inoculum (Supplementary Figure S1) , suggesting no pronounced bottle effect on sediment microbiota during the 4-month storage before setting up the SIP incubations. Pyrotag sequencing was performed on unfractionated total DNA from sediments at the time point of SIP inoculation, as well as on 'heavy' fractions of rRNA and DNA from the respective gradients. Amplicon sequencing on a 454 GS FLX pyrosequencer (454 Life Sciences, a Roche company, Branford, CT, USA), data processing and read quality trimming were performed as described (Pilloni et al., 2012) . Pyrotag reads were taxonomically classified according to the ARB SILVA taxonomy (SSURef_108, release September 2011) using the SILVA-based nextgeneration sequencing pipeline (Quast et al., 2013) . The taxonomic assignment of sequences to DSS subclades, that is, SEEP-SRB1a, SCA1, SCA2, LCA1 and LCA2 (Table 1) , has been carried out using ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004) . One representative sequence of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (95% criterion) that have been assigned to Desulfobacteraceae based on the SILVA-based next-generation sequencing pipeline has been imported into ARB SILVA database SSURef_111. After manual optimization of alignments sequences have been added to the provided tree under parsimony criteria. For T-RF prediction, forward and reverse sequences were assembled into contigs (Pilloni et al., 2012) . Subsequently, dominating contigs were again taxonomically classified using the SILVA-based next-generation sequencing pipeline and imported into ARB. T-RFs of contigs were predicted using TRiFle (Junier et al., 2008) and search functions implemented in the ARB software package. Given OTU numbers were calculated based on a 95% criterion using the reverse sequences. The delta subunit of the (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase gene (masD) was amplified using primers 7757f-1 and 7757f-2/8546r (von Netzer et al., 2013) or ass/bssF and ass/bssR (for GB-SC incubation; Callaghan et al., 2010) as described previously. Cloning and sequencing was performed as described previously (Kleindienst et al., 2012) . Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic 16S rRNA-based trees were calculated by neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood (RAxML and PhyML) analysis with a filter considering 1244 positions that are conserved in at least 50% of the selected deltaproteobacterial sequences. For tree calculation, only nearly full-length sequences were used. Unstable branching orders are visualized as a multifurcation. Partial sequences from this study were inserted into the reconstructed tree by parsimony criteria. MasD-based trees were calculated from deduced amino acids by maximumlikelihood (RAxML and PhyML) analysis with a filter considering 159-amino-acid positions that are conserved in at least 30% of the selected sequences. Sequence accession numbers 16S rRNA gene sequences and masD sequences have been submitted to the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases under the accession no. HE797917-HE797929 and HG764655-HG764728, respectively. Pyrotag sequencing raw data have been stored in the sequence read archive under SRA accession number ERP001437. Protein-SIP Two grams of incubated sediments were suspended in 5.4 ml extraction buffer (Benndorf et al., 2009) and subjected to three cycles of freeze (in liquid nitrogen) and thaw (water bath at 65 1C) with the addition of 0.6 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate (10%, w/v) before the last thawing step. After phenol extraction and acetate precipitation of the organic and aqueous phase, extracted proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970) . Five sections of each lane were excised from the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and treated according to Jehmlich et al. (2008) . Eluted peptides from the aqueous-phase gel slices were combined. Purification was carried out using ZipTip C18 columns (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), resulting in six fractions per sample. Abbreviations: AMV, Amon Mud Volcano; GB, Guaymas Basin; LC, long chain; NGS, next-generation sequencing; SC, short chain; SIP, stable isotope probing; T-RF, terminal restriction fragment. Sequencing was carried on DNA from inoculum sediments (t 0 ) and on 13 C-enriched RNA (AMV) or DNA (GB) from our incubations with 13 Clabeled butane or 13 C-labeled dodecane after density gradient centrifugation. Number of reads give the sum of retrieved forward (primer 27f) and reverse (primer 519r) sequences. Characteristic T-RFs were predicted via assembled amplicon contigs and are given as T-RFs actually observed in the electropherograms as verified according to Winderl et al. (2010) . Percentages of T-RFs give the portion of sequences of the individual clades assigned to the respective T-RF. a Based on ARB SILVA taxonomy. Mass spectrometric measurement was carried out using the nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) coupled LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (Herbst et al., 2013) . Trapping was performed for 6 min. To elute the peptides the acetonitrile solvent gradient was set in the first 54 min from 2% to 20% and subsequently 28 min from 20% to 85%. For peptide identification, first a survey search using Mascot (Perkins et al., 1999) against all prokaryotic entries of NCBInr (28 April 2013) was performed. These unfiltered results and a six-frame translation of the genome of strain BuS5 (Stefan M Sievert, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Whole, MA, USA; JGI project number 403224; http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi) were used as database for peptide identification. The translation was made with MaxQuant 1.2.0.18 (Cox and Mann, 2008 ) and a minimum of 50 amino acids per ORF. Furthermore, contaminants and reverse entries as decoys were added to the database. The main search used OMSSA (Geer et al., 2004) in an OpenMS pipeline (Sturm et al., 2008) . Carbamidomethylation of cysteins was treated as fixed modification and oxidation of methionines as variable modification. Mass deviation tolerances were 5 p.p.m. for precursor masses and 0.5 Da for product ions. The maximal false discovery rate for peptides was set to 1%. Protein relative isotope abundance (RIA) and protein labeling ratio RIA and the labeling ratio were determined using OpenMS and the MetaproSIP tool (http://openms. de/metaprosip) with a minimum correlation of 0.7 and a mass window of 10 p.p.m. Bacterial diversity in AMV and GB sediments We initially characterized the bacterial diversity in contrasting sediments from a gas seep at AMV emitting high fluxes of methane and other SCA and in sediments from a hydrocarbon seep in the GB releasing a complex hydrocarbon mixture similar to crude oil with various n-alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. AMV gas seep sediments used as inoculum (t 0 ) for later SIP experiments were clearly dominated by Deltaproteobacteria contributing almost three-quarters of the obtained 5139 pyrosequencing reads (Table 1 ). The diversity within the Deltaproteobacteria was high with 579 OTUs on the genus level (95% cutoff, Yarza et al., 2010) from overall 1151 bacterial OTUs. About 50% of total AMV sequences ( ¼ 70% of deltaproteobacterial sequences) were affiliated with the DSS subclade SEEP-SRB1. Of these, 65% affiliated with SEEPSRB1a, the sulfate-reducing partner of ANME-2a and ANME-2c in AOM habitats (Schreiber et al., 2010) . Sequences found at lower frequency were affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria (8%), Epsilonproteobacteria (5%) and candidate division OP9 (3%). In GB hydrocarbon seep sediments, a total of 546 bacterial OTUs were detected. Of these, 159 OTUs ( ¼ 29% of bacterial OTUs) have been assigned to Deltaproteobacteria, suggesting a lower diversity in GB sediments compared with AMV. About 14% of total GB sequences ( ¼ 40% of deltaproteobacterial sequences) were assigned to the deep-branching group Hot-Seep1 that was shown to be involved in thermophilic AOM (Holler et al., 2011;  Table 1 ). Other sequences frequently found in GB sediments were affiliated with Epsilonproteobacteria (12%), Bacteroidetes (8%) and Chloroflexi (5%). The detected phyla match well with the current picture of bacterial diversity in sediments from similar sites at AMV (Omoregie et al., 2009; Pachiadaki et al., 2011) This congruency also confirms that SIP experiments were carried out with benthic communities that typically occur at these seeps. Incubations with 13 C-labeled butane (SC) or dodecane (LC) were started in replicates under sulfatereducing conditions, resulting in four types of incubations: AMV-SC, AMV-LC, GB-SC and GB-LC. Alkane-dependent microbial activity differed among the four incubations. The incubations of AMV sediments with butane (AMV-SC) had the fastest response. Butane degradation started without lag phase, as determined based on butane-dependent sulfide production, butane oxidation and production of 13 CO 2 (Figures 2a and b) . After 29 days, the selected end point of AMV-SC incubation, almost complete removal of butane occurred, which coincided with 6 mM sulfide production and a strong labeling of resulting CO 2 (15% 13 C-DIC). In contrast, a pronounced lag phase of 20 days was observed for incubations of GB sediments with butane (GB-SC). By day 113, butane was consumed resulting in 21% 13 C-DIC. Dodecane-dependent SR was delayed in both incubations (AMV-LC and GB-LC). Significant sulfide production started only after 80 days (Figure 2a ) and 6 mM sulfide was produced after 232 days (GB) and 309 days (AMV), leading to an enrichment of 24% and 21% 13 C-DIC, respectively (Figure 2b ). Our data show that both sediments are able to react within weeks to months on the addition of butane or dodecane. Four DSS clades are key degraders of butane and dodecane An early time point and the end point of SIP experiments were selected for DNA and RNA extraction on each of the duplicate 13 C-labeled alkane incubations for subsequent ultracentrifugation. Except for GB-LC, no considerable relative increase in total cell counts was observed between t 0 and the individual first sampling points (Supplementary Figure S2) . The absence of significant cell growth is the prerequisite for a reliable identification of primary degraders by SIP experiments whereas cross-feeding could therefore be neglected at t 1 . All density-resolved nucleic acid fractions were first subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting, to identify the T-RFs of 13 C-labeled populations, which were subsequently identified by pyrotag sequencing of selected gradient fractions. Butane degraders. Two subclades of DSS were identified in AMV sediments: after only 9 days, a T-RF of 132 bp length became dominant in the heavy rRNA fraction (Figure 3) and was identified as a close relative of the butane-degrading strain BuS5 (93% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; Figure 1 ). The second subclade was identified after 29 days based on a T-RF of 512 bp length, representing butane degraders closely related (99.6%) to phylotype 'But12_GMe' that dominated an enrichment culture on butane (Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Jaekel et al., 2012) . A neighbored subclade contains two phylotypes dominant in enrichments with propane (Prop12_GMe) or butane (But12_HR; Jaekel et al., 2012) . We name these three neighboring clusters of propane and butane degraders 'SCA1'. In addition to the identified populations represented by these major labeled T-RFs, several further SCA1-OTUs based on a 95% similarity criterion were identified in AMV sediments, resulting in a total of 5 OTUs for subclade But12_GMe and 14 OTUs for subclade BuS5, suggesting the presence of multiple closely related genera capable of butane degradation. In support of our hypothesis, enrichments with sediments from Garden Banks mud volcano (Northern Gulf of Mexico) supplemented with C 2 -C 4 alkanes were dominated by members of SCA1 . Furthermore, public database analysis shows that members of SCA1 are indeed globally distributed. They have been retrieved from marine seep sites in the Mediterranean (Pachiadaki et al., 2011) , at Hydrate Ridge (Jaekel et al., 2012) , Gulf of Mexico or GB (Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Jaekel et al., 2012) . With this functional characterization of members of SCA1, we substantiate that this group is likely of relevance in the environment and that the isolate BuS5 is a relevant model organism. In GB sediments, butane stimulated a different DSS subclade: after 57 days, a 163 bp T-RF (Figure 3 ) was detected, which we named 'SCA2' (Figure 1 ). 60  62  63  73  81  89  92  115  121  129  132  141  143  146  159  162  163  164  197  297  312  314  466  468  474  475  512  514  529 ) for each fraction are given in brackets. T-RFs corresponding to taxa identified to be involved in the degradation of butane and dodecane are highlighted with circles. Fingerprints for sediment inocula are shown as reference. Anaerobic alkane oxidation at marine seeps S Kleindienst et al SCA2 is phylogenetically closely related to SCA1 with up to 95% sequence similarity, but appears to be restricted to GB. After 113 days, an additional labeled T-RF of 92 bp length emerged and was identified as uncultured Marinilabiaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes. In general, Bacteroidetes are known to degrade high-molecular-weight compounds (e.g. polysaccharides, proteins) and to have a preference for growth attached to particles (Fernández-Gó mez et al., 2013). We therefore assume that members of this clade were secondarily labeled, by using dead biomass of or other trophic interaction with the primary hydrocarbon consumers, rather than degrading butane on its own. Yet, it should be noted that related sequences originate from several seeps in the Mediterranean, Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean (e.g. Omoregie et al., 2008; Ruff et al., 2013) . Therefore, it would be worthwhile to investigate the role of this clade in marine hydrocarbon catabolism more specifically. Dodecane degraders. Another 163 bp T-RF became apparent in heavy rRNA of AMV-LC. It was assigned to organisms of another DSS subclade, which we named 'LCA1'. LCA1 comprises eight OTUs from AMV sediments and shows an intragroup 16S rRNA similarity of as low as 88.5%. It is phylogenetically clearly distinct from SCA1 and SCA2 (Figure 1 ). It comprises not only sequences from marine seep sites or hydrocarbon-polluted sediments (Zhang et al., 2010; Elsaied et al., 2011; Acosta-González et al., 2013; Ruff et al., 2013) but also sequences retrieved from the chemocline in the meromictic freshwater lake Cadagno (Halm et al., 2009 ). Moreover, a second 13 C-labeled T-RF (89 bp) was detected in the AMV-LC incubation only for the first time point (Figure 3) . However, phylogenetic assignment of this T-RF failed, as no sequences with a matching restriction site were found in the corresponding 454 data set. In GB-LC incubations, a dominating 164 bp T-RF was identified in heavy rRNA after 115 days of incubation with 13 C-dodecane. This T-RF represents a novel clade of Desulfobacteraceae that is most closely related to Desulfosalsimonas propionica. We propose to name this clade as 'LCA2' and regard it as another subclade of DSS, even though members of clade LCA2 hold one mismatch to probe DSS658 (position 14, C-T). Two and four OTUs of LCA2 were identified in AMV and GB sediments, respectively. Other sequences from marine seeps or oil-contaminated sites (Figure 1 ; e.g. Lö sekann et al., 2007; Abed et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Ruff et al., 2013 ) also belong to the LCA2 clade, and could potentially also be involved in dodecane degradation. A second labeled T-RF (512 bp) was identified in heavy DNA of the GB-LC incubation. The corresponding organisms form a cluster within Desulfobulbaceae, together with sequences retrieved from a mud volcano in the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g. clone GoC_Bac_176, FN820344; Figure 1 ). If members of this cluster are capable of dodecane oxidation or have been labeled through cross-feeding needs further investigation. Comparative 16S rRNA analysis (Table 1) suggests a low abundance in GB sediments. Additionally, members of the candidate phylum Omnitrophica (OP3; Rinke et al., 2013) , belonging to the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae superphylum, were found labeled in GB-LC incubations based on a T-RF of 671 bp length (Figure 3) . The OP3 lineage seems to be ubiquitous in anoxic environments, such as marine habitats. Recent studies reported the genomic potential for anaerobic respiration or the syntrophic involvement of OP3 in anaerobic monoterpene degradation (Rotaru et al., 2012) . Further studies are clearly required to unravel whether these microbes were 13 C labeled in our incubations owing to syntrophy or cross-feeding. In summary, all identified clades from our study and suggested carbon flow in the distinct sediments are depicted in Detection of SCA-and LCA-degrading DSS subclades in situ A set of CARD-FISH probes was developed for the specific detection of butane-and dodecane-degrading DSS subclades (Figure 1 and Supplementary  Table S1 ). After careful adjustment of specific hybridization conditions, the new probes were applied on our SIP incubations. Cell size and morphology differed for SCA1 subclades (Figure 4 ): cells belonging to subclade 'BuS5' have an almost coccoid morphology of 1.8 mm Â 2 mm, whereas cells of subclade 'But12_GMe' are curved rods of 1.5 mm Â 2.1 mm. Cells of SCA2 were either short rods (1 mm Â 1.3 mm) or vibrio-like (2.5 mm Â 1.5 mm). LCA1 and LCA2 cells were both cocci with a diameter of approximately 1 mm. We observed a strong specific cell increase for all four clades in course of the experiment (Figure 2c ). SCA1 and SCA2 cell numbers increased by a factor of approximately 6 within 29 and 113 days, respectively. LCA1 and LCA2 cell numbers increased by a factor of 23 and 59 during incubation. The detected growth of these clades strongly supports the correct taxonomic assignment of the identified T-RFs by polymerase chain reactionindependent means, and thus the capability of these organisms for alkane degradation. The in situ presence and relevance of SCA1, SCA2 and LCA2 was confirmed by CARD-FISH on nearby sediments with relative abundances between 0.2% and 2% of total single cells (max 4.4 Â 10 7 cells ml À 1 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). LCA1 cells could not be detected in these samples, possibly because of a too high selectivity of probe LCA1-443, which covers only the specific organisms represented by the 163 bp T-RF, plus one additional sequence. This evidence for the presence of three out of four of the identified DSS subclades in low abundances at the two investigated seep sites is compelling. From this seed bank, different SC and LC alkane degraders were apparently capable of growing, over relatively short time frames from days to weeks, and initiate alkane degradation. Diversity of masD genes in SC and LC incubations MasD gene libraries constructed from the four incubations revealed a high diversity of organisms associated with alkane degradation: of a total of 247 masD sequences, 22 OTUs (based on 93% aminoacid identity) were detected in AMV-SC, 25 OTUs in AMV-LC, 11 OTUs in GB-SC, and 16 OTUs in GB-LC. Several habitat-specific clusters became obvious in the phylogenetic tree comprising sequences either from AMV or from GB (Supplementary Figure S3) . Substrate-specific clades were detected only for GB-SC and GB-LC incubations. The high masD diversity supported our findings based on 16S rRNA, that is, the presence of multiple closely related genera capable of alkane degradation. Furthermore, this diversity suggests a great potential of marine benthic communities to respond to hydrocarbon inputs and natural changes in seepage. Gas hydrate decay, gas leakage or oil spills are only some of the possible events able to cause an increased hydrocarbon input on the sediments. Proteins involved in SC and LC alkane degradation under sulfate-reducing conditions We directly identified enzymes and catabolic pathways involved in butane and dodecane oxidation in these sediments using protein-SIP. In AMV-SC, AMV-LC, GB-SC and GB-LC incubations, the functional metaproteomic approach identified between 511 (1143 peptide species) and 1493 (3869 peptide species) proteins (see Supplementary Table  S3 ). C-labeled peptides showed mostly hits to proteins of the Desulfobacteraceae, thus further substantiating our finding that active alkane degraders in AMV and GB sediments belong to this family. A crucial step in the anaerobic degradation of alkanes is their activation. A common activation reaction is the addition of alkanes to fumarate yielding alkylsuccinates ( Figure 5 ; Rabus et al., 2001) . The genes responsible for the initial alkylsuccinate synthase reaction have been identified and named masD (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase; Grundmann et al., 2008) or assA (alkylsuccinate synthase; Callaghan et al., 2008) . Based on the available BuS5 genome (SCAFFOLD_2:TRUE:69872), 13 C-labeled MasD peptides could be identified within the AMV-SC (28 peptide species), AMV-LC (2 peptide species) and GB-SC incubations (2 peptide species; Supplementary Table S3 ). Fumarate addition is followed by a carbon skeleton rearrangement before b-oxidation. The b-oxidation has been proposed as an analog to the degradation of LC fatty acids (Wilkes et al., 2002) . The detection of 13 C-labeled peptides in AMV-SC, AMV-LC and GB-SC incubations involved in b-oxidation corroborate this pathway. These peptides were assigned to b-oxidation enzymes responsible for dehydrogenation (i.e. acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase), hydration (i.e. enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase) and oxidation (3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydrogenase) (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) . Alkane-degrading SRB within the Desulfobacteraceae have the capability for complete substrate oxidation, and thus they further metabolize acetyl-CoA. The most common pathway for acetyl-CoA/acetate dissimilation in SRB is the reverse Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, with carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (reverse acetyl-CoA synthetase) as a key enzyme (Schauder et al., 1986) . 13 C-labeled peptides corresponding to four enzymes of the WoodLjungdahl pathway were indeed identified: carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase (also named formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase) and formate dehydrogenase. These findings strongly indicate that alkane-degrading SRB use the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for terminal oxidation and that acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite during alkane degradation. The presence of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex suggests that these alkane degraders could, in principle, also grow on acetate as an alternative substrate. The identified labeled peptides allowed the reconstruction of the complete pathway of alkane activation and further degradation to CO 2 ( Figure 5) . Furthermore, 13 C-labeled peptides from AMV incubations could be assigned to the three key enzymes of dissimilatory SR, that is, sulfate adenylyltransferase, adenosine-5 0 -phosphosulfate reductase and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR, subunits a and b; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 ). This corroborates that alkane degradation is directly linked to SR. Labeled peptides involved in SR showed highest BLAST scores to proteins from Desulfobacteraceae supporting that the key butane and dodecane degraders belong to this family. The remaining labeled peptides were mainly derived from highly conserved proteins such as chaperones, ATP synthases and K þ -insensitive pyrophosphateenergized proton pumps, again affiliating mainly with Desulfobacteraceae. Protein-SIP also allowed quantitative interpretation of butane-and dodecane-derived carbon assimilation (Figure 2d ). The RIA directly corresponds to the 13 C content in newly synthesized proteins. Thus, it reflects the carbon source composition of newly synthesized biomass. As the 13 C content of the provided alkane substrates was 100%, but the RIA only approximately 50%, roughly half of the biomass carbon did not derive from alkane degradation. The remaining half could be gained from either other non-labeled substrates or from fixation of inorganic carbon. Particularly in the AMV-SC samples, a good correlation between RIA and 13 C-DIC increase could be observed. The increase in the average 13 C content corresponded to 50% of the 13 C-DIC increase (example shown in Supplementary Figure S4 ). These SRBs probably use about 50% alkanes and 50% DIC for biomass production. This is in accordance with current knowledge on SRBs, which are known to derive a large fraction of their carbon from CO 2 via carboxylation reactions (Rabus et al., 2006) . In AMV-SC and AMV-LC incubations, we found several 13 C-labeled peptides assigned to pyruvate: ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase, an enzyme typically used by SRB for acetyl-CoA assimilation through reductive carboxylation to pyruvate. The impact of non-methane-dependent SR was thoroughly described for various marine seep sites and has been suggested to be of global significance for the marine carbon and sulfur cycle. However, before our study, this concept has been based mostly Figure 5 Reconstruction of the complete pathway of alkane activation and further degradation to CO 2 based on 13 C-labeled peptides as identified via protein-SIP on AMV and GB incubations. on rate measurements (e.g. Joye et al., 2004; Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Orcutt et al., 2010; Bowles et al., 2011; Quistad and Valentine, 2011; Bose et al., 2013) and isolates or enrichment cultures of hydrocarbon-degrading SRB (e.g. Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Jaekel et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2013; Bose et al., 2013) . Here, we provide the direct link between biogeochemical patterns and apparently specialized DSS subclades of key alkane degraders in marine sediments. Nucleic-acid-SIP and protein-SIP, which has been combined for the first time on a marine sediment sample, proved as powerful approach for the investigation of the microbial community associated with alkane degradation. Complementary to aerobic hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial populations in the marine realm (Hazen et al., 2010; Abbriano et al., 2011; Kostka et al., 2011; Baelum et al., 2012; Redmond and Valentine, 2012; Gutierrez et al., 2013) , this study corroborates the environmental importance of the DSS clade for the anaerobic degradation of alkanes at marine seeps. Moreover, the identification of diverse and substratespecialized clades of sulfate-reducing bacteria initiating alkane degradation within days to weeks suggests an overlooked potential of natural marine benthic microbiota to react to massive hydrocarbon input, for example, as encountered during anthropogenic oil spills. Finally, we provided evidence that available isolates and their hydrocarbon activation mechanisms are of great relevance for natural settings.

214917229,"Microbial Community Composition and Functional Capacity in a Terrestrial Ferruginous, Sulfate-Depleted Mud Volcano",N/A,"Terrestrial mud volcanoes (MVs) are an important natural source of methane emission. The role of microbial processes in methane cycling and organic transformation in such environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to uncover functional potentials and community assemblages across geochemical transitions in a ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV of eastern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles combined with 16S rRNA gene abundances indicated that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by ANME-2a group coincided with iron/manganese reduction by Desulfuromonadales at shallow depths deprived of sulfate. The activity of AOM was stimulated either by methane alone or by methane and a range of electron acceptors, such as sulfate, ferrihydrite, and artificial humic acid. Metagenomic analyses revealed that functional genes for AOM and metal reduction were more abundant at shallow intervals. In particular, genes encoding pili expression and electron transport through multi-heme cytochromes were prevalent, suggesting potential intercellular interactions for electron transport involved in AOM. For comparison, genes responsible for methanogenesis and degradation of chitin and plant-derived molecules were more abundant at depth. The gene distribution combined with the enhanced proportions of 16S rRNA genes related to methanogens and heterotrophs, and geochemical characteristics suggest that particulate organic matter was degraded into various organic entities that could further fuel in situ methanogenesis. Finally, genes responsible for aerobic methane oxidation were more abundant in the bubbling pool and nearsurface sediments. These methane oxidizers account for the ultimate attenuation of methane discharge into the atmosphere. Overall, our results demonstrated that various community members were compartmentalized into stratified niches along geochemical gradients. These community members form a metabolic network that cascades the carbon transformation from the upstream degradation of recalcitrant organic carbon Mud volcanoes (MVs) are prominent surface expressions in compressional tectonic regimes (Kopf, 2002) . They are morphologically diverse, ranging from mud pies to conical structures, from which gaseous fluids with unconsolidated, fine-grained sediments are expelled (Dimitrov, 2002; Kopf, 2002) . Often, methane with CO 2 and minor amounts of C 2+ hydrocarbons constitute the emitted phase (Mazzini et al., 2009) . Recent estimates have revealed that MVs and seepages onshore and offshore might account for 27-36% of methane emissions from natural sources (Reeburgh, 2007; Etiope et al., 2008) . Considering the potentially huge storage of methane in subsurface environments (Milkov et al., 2003) , uncovering the regulative mechanisms involved in methane cycling and related metabolisms would enable better assessments of methane emission over various time scales (Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Net methane emission in terrestrial MVs is governed by physical and chemical characteristics of fluid reservoir, transportation styles, fluid pathways, and in situ microbial activities (Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Unlike their marine counterparts, whose emissions are mitigated by aerobic methane oxidation in seawater above them, terrestrial MVs emit methane directly into the atmosphere. Previous studies have indicated that the exact quantity of methane emission is primarily controlled by in situ microbial production and consumption near the surface (Alain et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012; Wrede et al., 2012; Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . The general framework for such microbial control has been speculated to share similarity with soil ecosystems where the decomposition of detrital organic carbon or dead plant biomass produces CO 2 or small organic compounds that could be converted into methane under strictly anoxic conditions (Achtnich et al., 1995; Davidson and Janssens, 2006) . Methane is either directly released into the atmosphere or oxidized with electron acceptors within sediments or from surface (e.g., oxygen, sulfate, or metal oxides) Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . Although the fate of methane produced in situ has been demonstrated in previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) , the assemblage and distribution of community members responsible for upstream organic mineralization and production of precursors (e.g., H 2 , acetate, and methyl-compounds) for methanogenesis in terrestrial MV environments have not been fully revealed. Most terrestrial MVs are characterized by a limited availability of sulfate (<1 mM). Such a low quantity of sulfate would increase the free energy (less negative) and drive sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) less energetically favorable. Therefore, whether the syntrophic partnerships between ANME groups and sulfate reducing Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus or Desulfobulbus clusters commonly observed in sulfate-rich marine settings (Knittel and Boetius, 2009 ) could be maintained or succeeded with different cell organization and metabolic pathway is not clear. On the basis of geochemical characteristics, incubation experiments, and microscopic observations, AOM using electron acceptors other than sulfate, such as ferric oxides, manganese oxides, nitrate, and humic acids, have been proposed or validated for marine sediments, freshwater sediments, wetland sediments, or anaerobic wastewater sludge (Beal et al., 2009; Haroon et al., 2013; Deutzmann et al., 2014; Egger et al., 2014; Ettwig et al., 2016; Scheller et al., 2016; Valenzuela et al., 2017) . The feasibility of these electron acceptors for AOM catalyzed by a given community has not been demonstrated for terrestrial MV environments. The aim of this study is to uncover the gene and community compositions involved in methanogenesis and methane oxidation, and the effect of various electron acceptors on AOM activity in a terrestrial ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MV. The Lei-Gong-Hou (LGH) MVs in eastern Taiwan were chosen for this investigation because previous studies have indicated that AOM mediated by the ANME-2a group cooccurred with iron/manganese reduction potentially catalyzed by Desulfuromonas spp. and Pelobacter spp. under low-sulfate conditions Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . The switchable interlayering of AOM and methanogenesis with respect to depth further highlights that in situ methanogenesis driven by the decomposition of carbohydrate is essential to supply methane for AOM at adjacent depths. To further investigate the potential of AOM, and microbial community composition and functional capacity across geochemical gradients, we collected geochemical and molecular data for a sediment core, and performed incubations of mud slurries supplied with 13 C-labeled methane and a variety of terminal electron acceptors. These data sets were further combined and integrated to demonstrate the flexibility of AOM processes, and the gene patterns and community compositions involved in methane and organic cycling.  Muddy fluids from a bubbling pool (named LGH03) and a core with a total length of 160 cm from the pool margin were retrieved from the LGHMVs in eastern Taiwan in July of 2011 for geochemical and molecular analyses. Fluids from another bubbling pool (named LGH09) and sediments at a depth of 10 cm on the pool margin were collected and mixed at a ratio of 1:1 in a serum bottle with no headspace left in August of 2015 for incubations. Geological and site backgrounds of LGHMVs have been described in previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . After retrieval, samples were transported to the laboratory within 5 h and the core was immediately sectioned at 5-cm intervals for analyses of gas and aqueous geochemistry, and DNA. The represented depth was the average depth of individual sectioned intervals. For gas geochemistry, a total of 6 mL of sediments from sectioned sediments was preserved in a serum bottle filled with 10 mL of 1 M NaOH, and sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum ring. The remaining sediments were subject to centrifugation at 8,200 × g for 15 min for aqueous geochemistry. Supernatants were filtered through 0.22-µm pore-sized polyethersulfone filters and split into four fractions. The cation fraction was preserved with 1/10 by volume of 2 M nitric acid. The fractions for anions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) individually were stored in prewashed vials without any preservative at 4 • C (for anions) or −20 • C (for DOC). The fraction for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was sealed in serum bottles and acidified with phosphorous acid. Concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn were measured using an Ultima2 inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, United States). Concentrations of anions were determined using an ion chromatograph (ICS-3000, Dionex, United States). DOC was oxidized to CO 2 through thermal catalytic conversion and measured using a Shimadzu TOC analyzer (TOC-L). The abundances of DIC and gaseous hydrocarbon compounds in headspace were measured using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a Porapak Q column, a thermal conductivity detector, and a flame ionization detector (6890N, Agilent Taiwan, Taiwan). The measured partial pressure of a specific gas compound was converted into the dissolved concentration with the volume of pore water. Concentrations of particulate total organic carbon (TOC) were determined by an elemental analyzer (EA, vario MICRO cube, Elementar). Carbon isotopic compositions of DIC, methane, and TOC were determined using a GC IsoLink or Flash EA in line with a MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). The isotopic compositions were reported using the δ notation (in permil, ): where the standard is referred to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The uncertainties for aqueous and gas geochemistry, elemental abundance of TOC, and δ 13 C are ±2%, ±5%, ±2%, and ±0.3 , respectively. The detectable limits for anions and cations with the consideration of dilution were 10 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respectively. Spearman's correlation was employed to examine the relationships between environmental factors. Crude DNA for 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses of environmental samples was extracted from 10 g of fluids/sediments in the bubbling pool (0 cm) and eleven depth intervals (2.5, 7.5, 12.5, 17.5, 27.5, 47.5, 67.5, 87.5, 107.5, 127.5, and 157.5  High-throughput sequencing of dual-indexed PCR amplicons encompassing the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was used to assess community compositions along depth and in incubated slurries. Fragments of 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the primer combinations of F515 (5 -GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-3 ) and R806 (5 -CCC GTC AAT TCM TTT RAG T-3 ) that target both bacterial and archaeal communities (Kozich et al., 2013) . Both forward and reverse primers were barcoded and appended with the Illumina-specific adapters. Each PCR mixture contained 1.1-1.5 ng of purified genomic DNA, 1 U of ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Japan), 0.2 mM of dNTPs, 0.2 µM of each primer, and 5 µl of 10× PCR buffer in a total volume of 25 µL. Thermal cycling involved a denaturation step at 94 • C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 • C for 45 s, annealing at 55 • C for 45 s, extension at 72 • C for 90 s, and a final extension step at 72 • C for 10 min. The products of three independent PCRs for individual samples were pooled, analyzed by gel electrophoresis for size verification (∼ 400 bp), and purified using the DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research, United States). Amplicons from different samples were pooled in equal quantities sufficient for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, United States). Quantitative PCR was used to analyze the 16S rRNA gene copy number of bacteria, archaea, and ANME-2a in the environmental samples and incubated mud slurries using a MyiQ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, United States). All samples were analyzed in triplicate reactions (20 µl each) with each composed of 1× SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, United States), 100 nM of each primer, and 2 µL of template DNA. Primers and PCR conditions were the same as those described in Chang et al. (2012) and Wang P.-L. et al. (2014) . The 16S rRNA gene copy number of a specific group was calculated assuming 650 g mole −1 of one base pair of DNA. Sequences of 16S rRNA gene amplicons were analyzed using the Mothur 1.34 following the standard protocols (Schloss et al., 2009 ). Barcoded sequences were de-multiplexed and filtered to remove low quality reads (Phread score < 25). Reads that had more than two mismatches to the paired barcode sequences were removed by the noise reduction while retaining the information of the representative reads and the numbers of reads merged by pre-clustering (Huse et al., 2010) . The unique reads were aligned to the Silva NR119 database 1 . Reads not aligned in the same region were removed. The sequence regions beyond the primers were truncated. Potential chimeric sequences were detected and removed using the UCHIME program (Edgar et al., 2011) . The number of sequences in each sample after quality filtering is shown in Supplementary Table S1 . The taxonomy of each unique sequence was assigned using the Silva SSU dataset of the NR 119 release as the reference. Taxonomy assignments with bootstrap values greater than 80% were considered to be valid. Sequences sharing more than 97% identity were further clustered into individual operational taxonomy units (OTUs) using the nearest neighbor algorithm (Schloss and Westcott, 2011) . Based on the rarefied datasets (n = 10,008), alpha diversity indices, such as the number of observed OTUs, Chao-1, and Inverse Simpson (Hill, 1973; Chao et al., 1984; Faith, 1992) , were computed. The weighted Unifrac (Lozupone and Knight, 2007) , which quantitatively incorporates the relatedness of community members with their abundances for the evaluation of difference between samples, was used to determine the community dissimilarity between samples from the sediment core. In addition, analyses of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was conducted on the basis of the weighted Unifrac distance matrix using the software Mothur 1.34 (Schloss et al., 2009) . The significance of environmental variables relative to the NMDS ordinations was computed using ""envfit"" and 999 permutations. Finally, the dissimilarity matrix between samples from the sediment core and incubations was constructed by the Bray-Curtis method (Bray and Curtis, 1957) and visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) using the R ""Phyloseq"" package. Based on the geochemical characteristics of pore fluids and gases, crude DNA extracted from samples from the bubbling pool and 2.5, 17.5, 27.5, 47.5, 87.5, and 127.5 cm of the core was selected for metagenomic analyses. In brief, metagenomic libraries with an insert size of 200-600 bp and 50 ng of DNA of each sample were prepared using the Ovation Ultralow System V2 1-96 (Nugen Technologies, United States). Paired-end sequencing (2× 300 bp) was performed on an Illumina Miseq platform. Low quality reads with a Phread score below 25, a length longer or shorter than two standard deviations from the mean, and ambiguous bases (Ns) were filtered from the dataset by the Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009; Hurwitz et al., 2013) . Reads 1 and 2 from the same fragment were subsequently merged. Since duplicate reads sharing 100% nucleotide similarity and identical length may represent sequencing artifact, the filtered reads were treated by digital normalization to systematize the data coverage, thereby decreasing the sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the majority of errors (Brown et al., 2012) . Metagenomic sequences were compared using the DIAMOND BLASTX (Buchfink et al., 2015) against the NCBI-nr database of non-redundant protein sequences (as of March 2015). BLASTX matches to prokaryote genes (Bacteria and Archaea) above a bit score of 60 and a minimum length of 50 bp were retained and evaluated according to functional categories based on the SEED classification of functional roles and subsystems (Overbeek et al., 2005) . The taxonomic composition of protein-coding genes was determined using the MEtaGenome ANalyzer 5 (Huson et al., 2011) based on the annotations of BLASTX-identified genes in accordance with the NCBI taxonomy. To further evaluate genes involved in methane metabolism, degradation of lignocellulose and chitin, fermentation, hydrogen production and consumption, dissimilatory metal reduction, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfur oxidation, dissimilatory nitrogen reduction, and nitrogen fixation, a list of key enzymes/functional genes (Supplementary Table S2 ) was searched against the results of BLASTX matching coding genes in the NCBI-nr database (the bit score is above 60 and the minimum length is 50 bp) by custom scripting. Since genes responsible for metal reduction have not been well determined, four genes including cytochrome c peroxidase (macA), sigma-54-dependent transcriptional response regulator (pilR), cytochrome C biogenesis protein (ppcA), and doubled CXXCH motif (CxxCH) were targeted to investigate the potential capability of metal reduction (Beliaev and Saffarini, 1998; Butler et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014) . A customized database composed of available complete genomes of methanogens and partial genomes of ANME groups was used for the annotation and determination of their taxonomy and relative abundances of genes related to methanogenesis and AOM. Genes used for these analyses are the key genes (including mcr, mtr, fwd, mch, mer, and mtd) for methanogenesis (Thauer, 2011) . Additionally, multi-heme cytochrome (MHC) genes with predicted S-layer domains from reconstructed ANME-2a genomes (ANME-2a: 2566125052 and 2566123487) (McGlynn et al., 2015) were tagged to represent the potential for direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). Gene-centric analysis was used to reveal differences in community functional capacity (Gill et al., 2006) . First, 37 single-copy housekeeping genes (Supplementary Table S3 ) were used to evaluate whether any metagenome was over-or underrepresented by the sequencing bias (He et al., 2015) . To do this, the odds ratios were calculated by dividing the abundances of specific single-copy genes in individual metagenomes with those in a combined average metagenome. For odds ratios around one, the sequencing bias for obtained metagenomes was minimal. The odds ratios of the abundances of individual functional genes in individual metagenomes to that in the combined average metagenome were used to compare gene abundances across samples and displayed with a heat map using the R ""gplots"" package. The average gene length based on the full-length opening reading frames from sequenced genomes deposited on NCBI (Supplementary Table S2 ) and the total number of reads matching coding genes in the NCBI-nr database in each sample (Supplementary Table S1 ) were first used to normalize the number of each functional gene (Supplementary Table S2 ). Then, the number of sequences matching the universal, putative singlecopy gene encoding RNA polymerase subunit B (rpoB, 4020 bp) was used to normalize the sequence count of target genes. A value equal to one indicates that the abundance of specific genes in the metagenome is equivalent to that of rpoB. All sequence data generated in this study are publicly available in the NCBI database under the BioProject accession PRJNA386622. A small portion of collected mud slurries was drained and the headspace was replaced with 100% methane at ∼1.5 bar. The bottle was kept at room temperature in an anoxic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, United States) for pre-incubation for 3 days to reduce any possible oxygen interference and stimulate the activity of anaerobic methane oxidizer. The basal salt solution was prepared in accordance with the general geochemical characteristics of the site following the recipe reported in Cheng et al. (2014) with a chloride concentration adjusted to 500 mM. The reducing agent (Na 2 S × 9H 2 O) at a final concentration of 2.08 mM was added into the sterilized basal salt solution to decrease the redox potential and remove any trace amount of oxygen. The basal salt medium was sulfate free and did not contain any carbon source or electron acceptor. For every set of incubations, slurries were mixed with an equal volume of basal salt and capped with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum rings. Triplicate bottles were supplemented with sulfate (10 mM), nitrate (5 mM), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, 1 mM), ferrihydrite (10 mM), fumarate (1 mM), ferrihydrite with AQDS (10 and 1 mM), ferrihydrite with fumarate (10 and 1 mM), or no exogenous electron acceptors (Supplementary Table S4 ). Ferrihydrite was synthesized by neutralizing a 0.4 M solution of ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (Lovley and Phillips, 1986) . The headspace gas was first exchanged in three cycles of vacuum and 0.22-µm filtered nitrogen with an end pressure of 1.01 bar. Then, 2 mL of 99.99% 13 CH 4 (Campro Scientific, Veenendaal, Netherlands) was injected into the headspace of each vial to provide a concentration of ∼1.82 × 10 4 ppmv. Additionally, two sets of controls were prepared. One was a nitrogen control (slurries mixed with nitrogen at 1.01 bar in the headspace), whereas the other was a sterilized control prepared with autoclave-sterilized slurries and 13 CH 4 in duplicate. In total, eight sets of incubations and two controls were performed under dark conditions at room temperature. The pH of resultant mixture was measured using the pH test strip and ranged from 7 to 8. The total amounts of 13 CO 2 in headspace and its isotopic compositions were monitored at a 30−55 day interval using a gas chromatography in line with a MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The headspace concentration was used to calculate the equilibrium concentration of DIC using the Henry's law constant (Stumm and Morgan, 1996) . The total moles of 13 CO 2 in headspace and dissolved form were summed and plotted against time duration of incubation. Methane oxidation rates were calculated by applying a linear regression on the accumulated amount of 13 CO 2 versus the time interval. The calculation assumed that all the produced 13 CO 2 in headspace was in equilibrium with the dissolved form and was solely derived from AOM. To compare whether the AOM rate of a specific treatment was significantly different from that for the sterilized control, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted.  Geochemical profiles of pore water showed various characteristics related to abiotic and microbial processes (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S5 ). Chloride concentrations ranged between 274 and 532 mM, with most data clustering between 350 and 400 mM and great fluctuations occurring at 7.5, 37.5, and 130-140 cm depth. Dissolved manganese and iron concentrations decreased with depth, with low values observed generally below 60 cm. Concentrations of sulfate and other major anions were below the detectable level. Methane concentrations increased from 0.39 to 1.57 mM with increasing depth. Carbon isotopic compositions of methane decreased from −49 at the core top to −59 at 25 cm and increased gradually to −55 at the core bottom. DOC concentrations were low (between 1 and 2.3 mM) at <72.5 cm and increased to above 2.5 mM at >72.5 cm. For comparison, DIC concentrations decreased from 1.9 to 1.1 mM with depth. The δ 13 C values of DIC generally increased from −5.4 at the core top to −0.2 at 107.5 cm and decreased to −4.3 at the core bottom. Abundances of all investigated taxonomic groups varied by two to three orders of magnitude along depth (Figure 1) . The bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances ranged between 7.33 × 10 5 and 4.61 × 10 7 copies (g −1 of sediments). Along depth, the copies of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were the lowest in the bubbling pool, increased to a maximum of 4.61 × 10 7 copies (g −1 of sediments) at 17.5 cm, and then exhibited a decline of one to two orders of magnitude toward the core bottom. The abundances of archaeal 16S rRNA genes ranged between 8.39 × 10 5 and 1.19 × 10 8 copies (g −1 of sediments), whereas the abundances of ANME-2a 16S rRNA genes varied from 1.67 × 10 5 to 1.41 × 10 7 copies (g −1 of sediments). Their variations were generally comparable with those of bacteria. The number of observed OTUs was the highest in the bubbling pool, decreased dramatically from the core top to the depth of 7.5 cm, and increased toward the bottom of the core (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1 ). The trends of the Chao1 estimator and Inverse Simpson indices resembled the pattern of observed OTUs, with the highest values of both richness and evenness occurring in the bubbling pool (Supplementary Figure S1) . Environmental vectors were fitted onto the ordination of NMDS (Figure 2A) . The projections were significantly correlated with the concentrations of Fe (R 2 = 0.60, P < 0.05), methane (R 2 = 0.48, P < 0.05) or δ 13 C values of CH 4 (R 2 = 0.50, P < 0.05). Communities from 2.5, 7.5, and 12.5 cm (high dissolved Fe concentrations and δ 13 C values of CH 4 ) were clearly separated from communities from 107.5, 127.5, and 157.5 cm (high concentrations of methane) along the first axis (Figure 2A) . A total of 18,401 bacterial and 3,510 archaeal OTUs (97% similarity), representing 157 classes (140 bacterial and 17 archaeal) within 44 phyla were recovered from all samples, with per sample OTU counts ranging from 1,622 to 6,207 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The dominant phyla include Proteobacteria (α, β, and γ divisions), Euryarchaeota, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria (∼79% of all sequences; Figure 2B) . Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, OP8, Thaumarchaeota, JS1, Spirochaetes, and OD1 were present at a lower abundance (∼7% of all sequences). The majority of bacterial reads were assigned to the orders Desulfuromonadales (14.8%) and Desulfobacterales (7.7%) within Deltaproteobacteria (Supplementary Table S6 ). Most sequences matching Desulfuromonadales were related to the families Sva1033, Desulfuromonadaceae, and Geobacteraceae. In particular, sequences affiliated with Desulfuromonadaceae constituted 26-29% of sequences in each sample at 2.5-12.5 cm depths, where methane concentrations were low and dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations were high. The dominant OTUs were classified to Sva1033 (Supplementary Table S7 ) and their abundances were highly correlated with the dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations (ρ = 0.78 and 0.75, respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, the majority of archaeal reads (18% of all reads) were assigned to the order Methanosarcinales within Methanomicrobia and primarily related to ANME-2 clades (9-36% in each sample) ( Figure 2B and Supplementary  Table S6 ). Most sequences (>98%) related to ANME-2 were phylogenetically assigned to the ANME-2a/2b group. The remaining 1% of ANME-2 related sequences shared 93% similarity with the nitrate-reducing anaerobic methane oxidizer, Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens (Haroon et al., 2013) . A few other sequences shared 99% similarity with the freshwater subgroup of ANME-1 from terrestrial subsurface environments in Japan (Takeuchi et al., 2011) and 97% similarity with ANME1b from MVs in southwestern Taiwan . A proportion of archaeal sequences were related to Methanobacteriales, Methanococcales, Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales, and Methanocellales. Their abundances were low at shallow depths (∼1% from the surface to the depth of 17.5 cm) and became abundant (5-8%) at depth intervals between 67.5 and 107.5 cm (Supplementary Figure S2a and Table S6 ). The dominant OTUs shared 99% and 97% similarity with Methanocalculus pumilus and Methanosarcina semesiae, respectively (Supplementary Table S7) . Sequences matching Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Thaumarchaeota were abundant in samples with methane concentrations lower than 1 mM. Within Gammaproteobacteria, distinct families dominated at different depths. For example, Methylomicrobium-related sequences (within Methylococcales) were primarily distributed in the bubbling pool, whereas Marinobacter-related sequences (within Alteromonadales) were abundant in the core samples (Supplementary Tables S6, S7 ). For comparison, dominant phyla in samples with methane concentrations above 1 mM include Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi (Anaerolineae), and Firmicutes (Figure 2) . Among these phyla, sequences affiliated with Prolixibacter denitrificans MIC1-1 (96% identity) within Bacteroidetes constituted 18% of total reads and represent the dominant OTUs at 87.5 cm (Supplementary Table S7 ). Sequences of the other major OTUs were related to Demequina spp. ER-8 within Actinobacteria, Thermotomaculum hydrothermale strain AC55 within Acidobacteria, uncultured Ardenticatenia within Chloroflexi, and uncultured Clostridiales within Firmicutes (Supplementary Table S7 ). A total of 0.8-1.7 million sequences per sample were obtained for further metagenomics analysis, and 21-32% of the sequences from each sample (373,020-769,841 reads per sample; Supplementary Table S1) were assigned to specific genes. A total of 28-34% of these annotated genes matched prokaryotic genes in the SEED (Supplementary Table S1 ). The majority of reads (>99%) were derived from prokaryotes (Supplementary Table S1 ). Therefore, protein coding sequences of prokaryotes were the main focus ( Figure 3A) . The odds ratios of specific single-copy genes in individual metagenomes to the average metagenome varied between 0.6 and 1.4 (Supplementary Figure S3) . With the exceptions for some genes from 2.5 and 87.5 cm, most odds ratios were between 0.8 and 1.2. These results suggest that the sequencing bias is limited and the obtained metagenomes could be used to address the abundance variations. The abundances of key enzymes/functional genes were variable along depth ( Figure 3B) . Of all gene systems, AOM, fermentation and hydrolysis, and metal reduction were the most abundant (Supplementary Figure S4) . The abundances of most investigated genes could not be differentiated statistically in accordance with the methane abundance category. Abundances of the genes mmo/pmo in the bubbling pool and top sediments were above the average for all depths ( Figure 3B ). The majority of the genes mmo/pmo were affiliated with Methylobacter spp. (sharing 80-96% identity) and Methylohalobius crimeensis (sharing 80-98% identity) within Methylococcaceae (Supplementary Table S8 ). The abundances of the genes mcr, mtr, fwd, mch, mer, and mtd affiliated with ANME members were highest in the bubbling pool and above the average at 27.5 and 47.5 cm ( Figure 3B ). These genes shared 80-95% similarity with the ANME-2a collected from Capt Aryutinov MV (Wang F.-P. et al., 2014) , and constituted the majority of archaeal reads (∼10% of all reads). In contrast, the same set of genes affiliated with methanogens (mostly Methanosarcinales) was more abundant at 87.5 and 127.5 cm than the average for all depths (Figure 3B ). Sequences representing two MHC genes with predicted S-layer domains were detected in seven samples and shared 60-80% similarity with ANME-2a. However, the relative abundances of the two genes were not particularly high (0.03-0.05%). Genes ak and pta (for synthesis of acetate from acetyl-CoA), genes adh and ldh (for production of alcohol and lactate), and gene hydA (for H 2 production) were more abundant at 87.5 cm than the average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . In contrast, gene acs (for acetate synthesis from acetyl-CoA) and gene hydB (for the oxidation of H 2 ) were more abundant in the bubbling pool than the average for all depths. Most of these reads were affiliated with Clostridium (for gene ak), Desulfuromonas (for gene pta), Bacillus (for gene adh), Gluconobacter (for gene ldh), Candidatus M. nitroreducens (for gene acs), Halanaerobium saccharolyticum (for gene hydA), and Geobacter spp. (for gene hydB) (Supplementary Table S8 ). MacA represents an intermediate carrier between electron transfer components in the inner and outer membranes (Butler et al., 2004) . Its abundances in the bubbling pool and at 2.5, 47.5, and 127.5 cm were above the average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . In contrast, the abundances of genes pilR, which encodes an enhancer binding protein involved in Fe(III) respiratory functions, and ppcA, an intermediary carrier for electron transport from acetate to terminal Fe(III) reductases in the outer membrane (Lloyd et al., 2006; Juárez et al., 2009) , and genes containing CxxCH heme-binding motif at 2.5, 17.5, and 27.5 cm were above the average for all depths (Figure 3B) . Most reads of pilR, ppcA, and CxxCH were affiliated with Geobacter (for macA and pilR), Geoalkalibacter (for macA), Desulfuromonas (for CxxH) and Pelobacter (for macA) within Desulfuromonadales (Supplementary Table S8 ). Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was inferred from the genes aprA [for conversions of adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS) to AMP and sulfite], sat (for conversions of activated sulfate to APS), and dsrAB (for reduction of sulfite to sulfide) ( Figure 3B ). The abundances of aprA, dsrAB, and sat at 17.5 cm were above the average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . Less than 3% of sequences encoding aprA were related to sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and 37% to AprA lineages I, 20% to Desulfobacteraceae, and 40% to Desulfobulbaceae. Reads of dsrAB were primarily related to Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfobacteraceae within Desulfobacterales. Additionally, 25% of dsrAB reads were affiliated with Peptococcaceae within Clostridiales (Supplementary Table S8 ). Reads of reverse dsrAB involved in aerobic and photosynthetic sulfur oxidation (Eisen et al., 2002; Ghosh and Dam, 2009; Loy et al., 2009) were affiliated with Thiothrix and Halorhodospira, respectively, and accounted for ∼4% of all dsrAB reads. The abundances of sulfur oxidation gene system (soxABYX) in the bubbling pool and at 2.5 and 17.5 cm were above average for all depths ( Figure 3B) . These reads shared 60-80% identity with Thiolapillus brandeum (Supplementary Table S8 ) isolated from the Okinawa Trough (Nunoura et al., 2014) . For dissimilatory nitrate reduction, the abundances of gene narG (which encodes the membrane-bound nitrate reductase) at 17.5 and 87.5 cm were above the average for all depths, whereas those of gene napA (which encodes the periplasmic nitrate reductase) at 2.5 and 17.5 cm were above the average for all depths. Both types of nitrite reductase (nirB and nrf A) catalyzing the reduction of nitrite to ammonium were more abundant at 2.5 and 17.5 cm than the average for all depths. Although diverse narG genes were detected, the majority of narG reads were affiliated with Marinobacter spp. (Supplementary  Table S8 ). The abundances of nif genes for di-nitrogen fixation in the bubbling pool and at 2.5 cm were above the average for all depths (Figure 3B) . Reads of nif genes (nif D, nif H, and nif K) were related with a variety of microorganisms and the majority were affiliated with Methanosarcina and Methanolobus (Supplementary Table S8 ). Most incubations yielded a steady increase of the accumulated 13 CO 2 with time (R 2 > 0.5; Supplementary Figure S5) . In contrast, the nitrogen control and incubations with ferrihydrite/AQDS, ferrihydrite/fumarate, and nitrate were characterized by different degrees of fluctuations in 13 CO 2 amount over time. Therefore, the rates derived from the regression analyses were calculated for individual incubations. High AOM activities at rates between 9.8 × 10 −4 and 1.2 × 10 −3 µmol cm −3 d −1 and between 7.6 × 10 −4 and 8.5 × 10 −4 µmol cm −3 d −1 were obtained for the incubations without exogenous electron acceptors and the ones supplied with sulfate, respectively ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S5) . In the presence of ferrihydrite, fumarate and AQDS, the rates ranged from 4.8 × 10 −4 to 5.2 × 10 −4 , from 1.6 × 10 −4 to 4.9 × 10 −4 , and from 1.9 × 10 −5 to 4.7 × 10 −4 µmol cm −3 d −1 , respectively. With the exceptions for one individual incubation with fumarate and AQDS, these rates were statistically different from the average rate of the sterilized control (1.5 × 10 −4 µmole cm −3 d −1 ) (P < 0.05). In contrast, in the presence of ferrihydrite/AQDS, ferrihydrite/fumarate, and nitrate, the 13 CO 2 was produced at a rate statistically no different from the sterilized control, and therefore considered negligible. The copy numbers of ANME-2a increased in the incubations with no exogenous electron acceptor (1.50 × 10 5 copies g −1 of slurries), sulfate (9.04 × 10 4 copies g −1 of slurries) and ferrihydrite (1.03 × 10 5 copies g −1 of slurries) when compared with the nitrogen control ( Figure 4B) . The copy numbers of ANME-2a in other incubations were either marginally higher or less than that in the nitrogen control. The two-dimensional PCoA plot revealed that communities clustered primarily by the addition of electron acceptors (Supplementary Figure S2b) . The community at the start of incubation was more similar to the communities in the bubbling pool and sediment core, and the addition of electron acceptors and methane shifted community compositions by various degrees after incubation for 176 days ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2b) . Desulfobacterales members appear to be the major group for the incubations without exogenous electron acceptors, or with sulfate or AQDS. The dominant OTU in these incubations was classified into the genus Desulfurivibrio (Supplementary Table S9 ) and shared 90% similarity with Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus (AHT2) from a soda lake in Egypt (NR_074971.1). The incubations supplied with fumarate or ferrihydrite/fumarate were characterized by abundant reads sharing 98% similarity with Pelobacter massiliensis (HHQ7) ( Supplementary Table S9 ), a strict anaerobe capable of fermenting l,2,4-trihydroxybenzene to acetate and reducing oxidized metal (Schnell et al., 1991) . The dominant OTU in the incubations supplied with ferrihydrite or nitrate shared 93% similarity with the uncultured clone (AB247832) collected from hydrothermal vents in Lau Basin. ANME-2a/2b reads dominated the archaeal communities in all incubations ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2a) . Reads affiliated with Methanococcus spp. and Methanosaeta spp. were abundant in the incubations without exogenous electron acceptors and those supplied with fumarate, respectively. For the other incubations, the proportion of methanogens was lower than 1% of total reads (Supplementary Figure S3) . Figure S4 . * symbol denotes the AOM rates significantly different from the sterilized control (P < 0.05).  The methane, DIC, and isotopic profiles are consistent with the compartmentalization of methane metabolisms at discrete depth intervals. At depths shallower than 20 cm, low methane concentrations, greater δ 13 C values of CH 4 , high DIC concentrations, and low δ 13 C values of DIC indicate the presence of methane oxidation. At the deeper intervals, the contrasting geochemical characteristics point to the predominance of methanogenesis over methane oxidation. Furthermore, dissolved Mn and Fe are generally dominated by their reduced forms [Mn(II) and Fe(II)] under near-neutral pH. Their high concentrations in the top portion of the core suggests that the pore water has to be anoxic. Methane oxidation prevailing at these intervals would be anaerobic. Resembling the findings of previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) , methane concentrations were inversely correlated with Fe/Mn concentrations (ρ = -0.65 and −0.65, respectively, P < 0.05). In contrast, the δ 13 C values of CH 4 and the concentrations of dissolved Mn and Fe showed a strong covariance (ρ = 0.71 and 0.69, respectively, P < 0.05). These geochemical characteristics mark the transition of Fe/Mn to methane at depths of less than 20 cm, suggesting that AOM might be linked directly or indirectly to microbial manganese/iron reduction through a pathway that remains uncharacterized thoroughly Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . Interpretation with regard to AOM and related metabolisms based on geochemical evidence is comparable with that based on molecular evidence obtained from this and previous studies Wang P.-L. et al., 2014) . The copy numbers of ANME-2a 16S rRNA genes were enhanced greatly at the methane transition intervals (<20 cm) (Figure 1) . Furthermore, genes responsible for the AOM processes, including mcr, mtr, fwd, mch, mer, and mtd, were all recovered from metagenomic data and phylogenetically classified into the ANME-2a lineage (Supplementary Figure S6) . These lines of evidence combined with positive AOM activities derived from incubation experiments (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S5 ) and geochemical characteristics (Figure 1) suggest that the anoxic sediments near the surface harbored substantial amounts of anaerobic methane oxidizers that actively oxidized methane produced at the adjacent depth intervals. Of all the incubation sets, the rate of AOM without exogenous electron acceptors appeared to be the fastest (Figure 4A) . The results suggest that AOM could proceed with the reduction of electron acceptors within sediments. Considering that sulfate and nitrate in pore water and the bubbling pool were below the detection, their abundances in the incubated slurries would be further diluted by the basal solution added. Therefore, the most plausible electron acceptor, if any, would be the oxidized iron associated with sediments. This inference is, however, not supported by the lower AOM rates obtained from the incubations with synthetic ferrihydrite when compared with the rates for treatments without an exogenous electron acceptor. Previous studies indicate that ferrihydrite is the least crystalline form of iron oxide commonly observed in natural samples (Waite et al., 1994) and, therefore, has the greatest bioreactivity for microbial iron reduction. If ferric iron is the target electron acceptor, AOM would have to use the solid form distinct from the ferrihydrite supplemented with incubations. Mineralogical investigations are warranted to attest this assertion. The AOM activities detected for incubations (excluding ferrihydrite/AQDS, ferrihydrite/fumarate, and nitrate) also suggest that a wide range of electron acceptors could at least maintain the viability of ANME-2a members to various degrees (Figure 4) . The results are partially comparable with the previous study in which sulfate, AQDS, ferric citrate, ferrihydrite, humic acids, and melanin could feasibly stimulate AOM activity in sediments retrieved from a marine seep and a canal (Ettwig et al., 2016; Scheller et al., 2016) . Our results additionally suggest that no exogenous addition, and additions of fumarate were also candidate treatments to facilitate the AOM. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene analysis conducted for incubated slurries yielded a predominance of ANME-2a members for positive AOM incubations (Supplementary Figure S3) . The ANME-2a members have been experimentally demonstrated to exploit AQDS alone or to form syntrophic partnerships with Deltaproteobacteria for sulfate reduction (Scheller et al., 2016) . The capability of ANME-2a members in exploiting all the other electron acceptors tested in this study has not been confirmed in previous studies. Geochemical characteristics indicated that iron and manganese reduction prevailed in the top 40 cm of sediments (Figure 1) . Such inferences were further supported by the results that Desulfuromonadales within Deltaproteobacteria constituted the most abundant order based on the 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses. Its abundances were positively correlated with the concentrations of dissolved Mn and Fe. Strains belonging to Desulfuromonadales are known to be capable of catalyzing anaerobic respiration with nitrate, elemental sulfur, ferrihydrite, or manganese oxide as electron acceptors (Köpke et al., 2005; Greene et al., 2009; Summers et al., 2010; Greene, 2014) . Members within Desulfuromonadales, such as Geobacter, rely on the outer membrane c-type cytochromes to transfer electrons to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides (Lovley, 1993; Mehta et al., 2005) . The great abundances of c-type cytochrome encoded genes (macA, ppcA, and CxxCH) phylogenetically affiliated with Geobacter and Pelobacter further revealed the prevalence of metal reduction at the top 40 cm (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S8 ). The coincidence of AOM and the metal reduction zone at similar depth intervals has been observed in this and previous studies for cores collected on different dates (2009 vs. 2010) . These results suggest the persistence of a possible linkage between AOM and metal reduction through time. AOM driven by iron reduction has only been experimentally demonstrated in enrichment cultures composed of 40-50% ""Candidatus M. nitroreducens"" of the ANME-2d group and 40% Methylomirabilis oxyfera of NC-10 phylum (Ettwig et al., 2016) . Additional incubations with M. oxyfera as the sole methane oxidizer did not yield the production of detectable ferrous iron, leading Ettwig et al. (2016) to conclude that AOM coupled with the production of ferrous iron was mediated solely by M. nitroreducens. However, the 16S rRNA genes related to M. nitroreducens constituted only a minor portion (<1%) of the total reads in any environmental or incubated samples described in this study (Supplementary Figure S3) , thereby precluding the attribution of the observed coincidence of AOM and metal reduction zone to the ANME-2d members. The enhanced abundances of ANME-2a and Desulfuromonadales in the metal-to-methane transition zone provides the possibility that these two populations might form syntrophic consortia to facilitate the electron transport during AOM. To date, DIET has been proposed as the principal mechanism to couple the electron transport from AOM to sulfate reduction (McGlynn et al., 2015; Wegener et al., 2015) . Through mining of ANME genomes and metagenomes, McGlynn et al. (2015) found that the genomes of ANME-2a/2b/2d groups encode large MHCs (up to 34 hemes). In particular, the MHCs of ANME-2 members were fused with the single putative S-layer domain. Such genetic organization together with cytochrome reactive staining and transmission electron microscopic observation led McGlynn et al. (2015) to propose that tandem proteins encoding formate dehydrogenase-related cytochrome b with MHCs and MHC/S-layer fusion proteins could be an effective route to facilitate interspecies transport of electrons generated from the oxidation of methane to the downstream product, reduced methanophenazine, thereby stabilizing syntrophic aggregate arrangements. It is likely that the MHC/S-layer fusion proteins might be also able to facilitate the reduction of metal oxides by ANME members without the need of metal reducers. Similarly, evidence from cultivation, expressions of genes (c-type cytochromes, mcrA, dsrA, and pilA), and visualization of microstructures has shown that the HotSeep-1 members could have produced nanowires, such as pili, extending to the surface of ANME-1 cells under the AOM conditions (Wegener et al., 2015) . Again, such structures provide a putative route that enables the DIET between anaerobic methane oxidizers and metal reducers, and might facilitate the formation of syntrophic consortia with loose contact between individual cells (Wegener et al., 2015) . The MHCs/S-layer fusion proteins of ANME-2a (McGlynn et al., 2015) were present in all metagenomes of LGHMVs. If the MHCs/S-layer fusion protein indeed accounts for the electron transfer for the detected ANME-2a, syntrophic consortia could form with the aid of possible interspecies electron transport through the mechanisms describe above. Alternatively, electrons generated from anaerobic methane oxidizers could be transferred directly to extracellular electron acceptors in a process similar to that conducted by G. sulfurreducens (Methé et al., 2003) and possibly by ANME-2d (Ettwig et al., 2016) . The exact interactions between the ANME and Desulfuromonadales members remain uncertain, as attempts to perform fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments were not successfully, likely due to the interference of sediment auto-fluorescence and low RNA content (unpublished results). Finally, 16S rRNA genes related to Methylomicrobium of Methylococcaceae appear to be abundant in the bubbling fluids (1.4%, compared to the lowest value of 0.04% at 47.5 cm). Similarly, the abundances of mmo were more abundant in the bubbling fluids than that in cored sediments. Most genes of mmo were affiliated with M. crimeensis within Methylococcaceae. Strains related to these genera are capable of oxidizing methane under oxic conditions. Since the bubbling fluids were generally thought to originate from mineral dehydration or sediment compaction at great depths, the fluids are regarded the least altered and representative of the reducing source condition. The presence of these aerobic methane oxidizers, however, suggests that atmospheric oxygen might be entrained into the pool fluids through gas bubbling at quantities sufficient to drive methane oxidation while outcompeting the kinetics of abiotic oxidation of other reducing compounds (e.g., ferrous iron). The oxygenation induced by gas bubbling has been observed in intertidal sediments near the seep (O'Hara et al., 1995) . Such a process would lead to a steeper redox gradient that facilitates the coexistence of metabolisms with a spectrum of oxygen affinities. Nevertheless, while methane emanating from the pool could be directly discharged into the atmosphere, the observed aerobic methane oxidizers could act as biological filters for methane discharge. For comparison, control of methane emitted from the mud platform adjacent to the pool would be primarily accounted for by the anaerobic methane oxidizers (e.g., ANME-2a members). A portion of DOC is formed through the hydrolysis and fermentation of organic matter catalyzed by microorganisms and fuels electron-accepting processes downstream the metabolic network. Therefore, DOC concentrations represent the interplay between the production and consumption processes mediated by different components of microbial populations. The low DOC concentration at shallow depth suggests that the production of DOC could have been efficiently channeled to metal reduction and perhaps AOM. In contrast, the high DOC concentration at deeper intervals suggests that the DOC cycling might not be as efficient as at shallow depths due to the production of different intermediate DOC compounds and/or the shift in microbial communities and functions. The enhanced proportions of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria, and the increased DOC concentrations at depth provide a link between the DOC accumulation and these taxonomic groups. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the dominant OTUs were affiliated with P. denitrificans, S. paucivorans, uncultured Ardenticatenia, and Demequina sp. ER-8. These closest strains are generally considered to be capable of degrading organic matter. For the degradation of specific categories of organic matter, the 16S rRNA gene sequences related to Mycobacterium within Actinobacteria and Fulvivirga within Bacteroidetes were inferred to represent community members capable of degrading chitin. Sequences 16S rRNA genes related to Prolixibacter within Bacteroidetes were inferred to represent community members capable of degrading plant-derived materials. Similarly, the greater abundances of genes rha, abf, and xyl compared to chi at depths between 77.5 and 97.5 cm were correlated with the increased concentrations of DOC, suggesting an enhanced capability for the decomposition of plant-derived materials primarily mediated by Bacteroidetes. Finally, the proliferation of fermenters, such as Clostridium, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus, which are known of being capable of synthesizing hydrocarbons from acetate, butyrate, and alcohol, might also contribute to the increased concentrations of DOC. Based on the classification of 16S rRNA amplicons (Supplementary Figures S2a) , the dominant methanogens at 67.5 cm were related to M. pumilus, a strain known for using H 2 /CO 2 for methane production (Mori et al., 2000) . In contrast, the abundances of acetoclastic Methanosaeta harundinacea (Rotaru et al., 2013) increased to be almost equal to those of M. pumilus at 87.5 cm. The variable proportions of methanogenrelated sequences along depth combined with methane isotopic compositions and DOC profiles suggest that that predominant methanogenic pathways (either CO 2 -reducing or acetoclastic) shifted at different depths, a metabolic scheme potentially driven by the end products from organic hydrolysis, degradation, and fermentation. The metagenomic results also indicated that reads classified to soxABYX system, aprA, and dsrAB were more abundant at 17.5 cm when compared with those at other depths. This combined with the detection of a small proportion of aprA genes taxonomically assigned to AprA lineage I composed of sulfur oxidizers, and Desulfocapsa sulfexigens capable of disproportionating inorganic sulfur compounds (Finster et al., 2013) , and abundant dsrAB genes assigned to Desulfobacterales and Desulfobulbaceae suggest that oxidative and reductive pathways of sulfur coexist at the depth interval geochemically interpreted as the anoxic zone. The coexistence of both sulfur oxidizers and sulfate reducers has been observed at depths below sulfate reduction zone, and inferred to catalyze the ""cryptic"" sulfur cycling based on the gene expression, rate measurement, and isotopic pattern (Wasmund et al., 2017) . It remains unclear whether such sulfur cycling also prevails at our investigated site. Patterns of geochemical characteristics, gene abundances and assemblages, and incubation responses suggest a wide range of metabolic capability and interactions for microbial communities thriving at the LGHMV. The metabolic interactions are primarily driven by the upstream degradation of complex organic matter (e.g., chitin and cellulose) and fermentation mediated by Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes at depth. Despite the fact that a portion of degradative and fermentative products in mobile phase are accumulated in pore water, some are further exploited by various methanogens, fueling downstream AOM processes catalyzed by the ANME2a members near the surface. While the AOM could be stimulated by a range of electron acceptors, their activity is intimately linked with iron reduction likely through intercellular electron transfer under the in situ conditions. The cascading transformation of organic carbon highlights the importance of the microbial metabolic network in cycling sediment-associated, recalcitrant organic matter and controlling methane emission in terrestrial ferruginous, sulfate-depleted MVs.

215265781,Deep-Sourced Fluids From a Convergent Margin Host Distinct Subseafloor Microbial Communities That Change Upon Mud Flow Expulsion,N/A,"Seafloor mud volcanoes (MVs) release tens of teragrams of methane annually into the overlying water column (Kopf, 2003; Milkov et al., 2004; Sauter et al., 2006; Sahling et al., 2009; Pape et al., 2014; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Methane forms the basis of seafloor chemosynthetic ecosystems and is oxidized aerobically or anaerobically through microbial metabolism (Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Van Dover et al., 2003; Knittel and Boetius, 2009) . MVs also expel fluids and mud breccia composed of clay-rich sediments with intermixed rock fragments, which can be sourced from several kilometers below the seafloor (Kopf, 2002; Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . High fluxes of methane and upward-directed fluid flow at active seafloor MVs can restrict the delivery of relevant electron acceptors, such as oxygen or sulfate, into the seafloor. This limits microbial capacity for methane oxidation (Niemann et al., 2006; Boetius and Wenzhöfer, 2013) . Furthermore, anaerobic methanotrophs (ANMEs), the dominant consumers of methane in sediments (Reeburgh, 2007) , have doubling times of up to 7 months in vitro (Nauhaus et al., 2007) and take years to dominate microbial communities in situ (Ruff et al., 2018) . These limitations on biological methane removal support the argument that MVs represent potent sources of methane emission to the hydrosphere (Etiope and Milkov, 2004) . Microbial community changes in recently erupted muds of MVs are understood to occur on timescales of several years. In flows aged 1-2 years from the Håkon Mosby MV (Barents Sea), communities dominated by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria were identified as an initial successional stage (Ruff et al., 2018) . Diffusion of electron acceptors, such as oxygen and sulfate, into fresh flows can be inhibited by upward transport of MV-derived mud breccia and reduced fluids (Niemann et al., 2006) , but nevertheless is understood to drive a suite of redoxstratified microbial metabolisms that occur with increasing depth: aerobic oxidation of sulfide, sulfate reduction, anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM), and methanogenesis (Lin et al., 2018) . Whether microbial communities across active MVs respond similarly to fluid expulsion is not known, given the considerable heterogeneity of fluid sources and compositions (Mazzini and Etiope, 2017) . Additionally, how tectonically derived, deep-sourced MV fluids impact microbial community structure and potential activity remains poorly understood. Recently, the South Chamorro Seamount, a MV influenced by serpentinizing fluids derived from subduction at the Mariana convergent plate margin, has been described as an energetically favorable regime for microbial habitation: methanogens were recovered and identified, but methane from the fluids likely formed abiotically (Kawagucci et al., 2018) . Considering the numerous challenges associated with drilling-based studies, microbial characterizations of deep subsurface systems are often limited to sites of fluid discharge into shallower horizons, often referred to as ""windows to the deep biosphere"" (Deming and Baross, 1993; Lee et al., 2015; Woycheese et al., 2015; Hoshino et al., 2017; Krauze et al., 2017) . Venere MV, in the central Mediterranean, is located within the Calabrian Accretionary Prism (CAP) (Panieri et al., 2013; Ceramicola et al., 2014) , ∼50 km offshore Calabria at 1,600 m below seafloor (mbsf). Its active status is apparent through methane seepage along its caldera rim, the presence of visually distinguishable mud breccia deposits recently extruded from the western summit, and meter-scale changes in seafloor morphology documented by repeated bathymetric surveys between 2014 and 2016 (Loher et al., 2018a,c) . In mud breccia from the western summit, porewater chloride depletions to 20% of seawater values are consistent with smectite-illite clay dehydration reactions, and hydrocarbons show a thermogenic signature. These support fluid origin temperatures of 60-150 • C that correspond to a depth between 3.5 and 7.5 km below the seafloor (Loher et al., 2018c) , which may be within the 5-7 km sediment column overlying the basement of the CAP (Ferrucci et al., 1991; Voogd et al., 1992) . Given that sedimentation rates at Venere MV and the nearby Crotone-Spartivento forearc basins range from 0.17 to 0.26 mm/year (Ceramicola et al., 2014; Loher et al., 2018a) , the maximum ages of these recently extruded deposits are likely only a few years. Using a suite of geochemical, 16S amplicon, and metagenomic sequence data, we sought to characterize microbial communities inhabiting deep-sourced mud breccia at Venere MV and to document changes in community composition associated with extrusion of flow deposits from the summit as they began to entrain seawater. We hypothesized that (1) both deepsourced fluids and seawater-derived electron acceptors such as sulfate would exert a notable influence on microbial community structure; (2) methanotrophic taxa would be found in methanerich mud breccia with increasing distance downslope of the Venere MV summit; and (3) gene content from MVs would be distinct from that of microbial communities inhabiting other subsurface environments.  Exposed mud breccia deposits at the western summit of the coneshaped Venere MV (Figure 1) were visually investigated during multiple remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives on MARUM cruise M112 aboard the R/V METEOR from November 29 to December 10, 2014. The most recently extruded deposits at the summit were gray in color and showed a rough surface texture, in contrast to deposits from previous mud breccia outflows, which were yellowish and characterized by a smooth texture. Sedimentological interpretation of cores from both flow deposits identified the material as mud breccia without any noticeable hemipelagic cover, and coring confirmed that the spatial extent of the flows extended up to 1.6 km downslope (Loher et al., 2018a,c) . Areas of methane seepage were hydroacoustically detected in the water column just below the western summit and at several locations around the caldera rim ( Figure 1B) where the release of gas bubbles from the seafloor was visually confirmed (see initial descriptions by Loher et al., 2018b,c) . For this study we targeted sites located at the summit, where freshened mud breccia had most recently been extruded. Gravity cores and a series of ROV-guided push cores obtained along a downslope transect of the mud flow deposits were collected and compared with a gravity core (GeoB19236-1) from gas seep site 1 ( Figure 1B) . Seep site 1 is located in the MV periphery on the rim of the caldera, where methane discharge is evident from hydroacoustic data and chemosynthetic communities typical of cold seep sites have been described (Loher et al., 2018b) . This gravity core consists of mud breccia overlain by 2 cm of fine showing Eastern and Western summits, ring faults along the caldera rim, five sites of observed gas seepage (orange stars), and locations of cores at seep site 1 and at a non-seep reference site to the southeast. Data from Loher et al. (2018a) . (C) Zoomed-in view of the Venere MV western summit showing locations of gravity and push cores (circles and diamonds, respectively) collected for microbiological sampling. The extent of two recently extruded mud breccia flow deposits are shown with older deposits outlined in gray, underlying younger deposits delineated in white. Maps are modified with permission from Loher et al. (2018a) . sandy sediment. In addition, a reference minicore (GeoB19279-3) retrieved southeast of the MV area ( Figure 1B ) was used as a background control. This core consisted of fine sand and hemipelagic sediment, lacking mud breccia or sediments affected by fluid seepage. During this expedition, gravity core sediments were collected using a strategy developed to minimize the time between recovery and sampling of gas hydrate-rich sediments (Pape et al., 2010) . Instead of using the common PVC liners, the core barrel was lined with a flexible polyethylene bag (film thickness 0.2 mm, R. Losch, Germany). Upon core recovery, the bag containing the sediment was removed from the barrel. The clear plastic allows for rapid inspection of the material. In contrast to conventional thickwalled PVC liners, the sediment can be sampled immediately by cutting through the bag with a sterile knife. Porewater, gas, and microbiology samples were collected less than 20 min after cores arrived on deck. Minicores and push cores were transferred to the ship's laboratory and sampled in intervals of several centimeters by extruding the sediments from the plastic tube with a piston. Samples for DNA extractions and methane concentrations were collected from the same minicores and push cores, while parallel cores were sampled for porewater. Whole round core samples for DNA extraction were sliced using an ethanol-sanitized spatula and transferred to Whirl-Pak bags (VWR, Radnor, PA, United States) before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 • C. To determine porewater methane concentrations, 3 ml of bulk sediment was transferred to a 20 ml glass vial filled with 5 ml NaOH, leaving 12 ml headspace. Rhizons (Seeberg-Elverfeldt et al., 2005) were used to draw porewater samples into acid-washed syringes over a period of 10 h. Porewaters were collected at room temperature, because bottom waters measured 18 • C. Porewater samples for cation measurements were transferred to 1.5 ml acid-washed tubes and acidified with 20 µl ultrapure concentrated (65%) HNO 3 . Salinity was measured onboard with a salinometer (Krüss Optronic, Hamburg, Germany) with a ±0.1 PSU precision, and calibrated daily against dilution of IAPSO standards with salinities of 9.989, 29.968, 34.993, and 38.022 PSU. Alkalinity was determined onboard by diluting a 0.5 ml porewater sample with 9.5 ml distilled water and stirring constantly in an open beaker while titrating with aliquots of a 0.01 M HCl standard until pH decreased below 4, normally between 3.9 and 3.5. The pH electrode (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, United States) was calibrated with buffers of pH 4, 7, and 10. Alkalinity was calculated using the equation: where v HCl is the volume (in ml) of HCl added to final pH, c HCl is the molar concentration of HCl, pH start and pH final are the initial and final pH readings, v 0 is the initial sample volume in ml, and f H is the activity coefficient of H + in seawater, taken as 0.79 (Culberson and Pytkowicz, 1973) . Dissolved methane in bulk sediment was analyzed onboard using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) equipped with a capillary column connected with a flame ionization detector, following the same procedure as described in Pape et al. (2010) . Reported concentrations of dissolved methane are ex situ concentrations, uncorrected for sediment temperature (Bunsen coefficient) and porosity. The high spatial heterogeneity of methane supply in the marine subsurface prevents an accurate determination of in situ porewater methane concentration, unless cores are analyzed at pressure (Milkov et al., 2003; Pape et al., 2011) . Pressure cores from the Venere MV summit yielded average methane concentrations of 321 mmol/l, above the solubility of 120 mmol/l (Loher et al., 2018c) , and two orders of magnitude higher than ex situ values reported here. This agrees with previous observations where ∼1% of methane by volume was recovered from gravity cores (Paull and Ussler, 2001 ). These loss estimates are corroborated by strong degassing and observed ""moussy"" textures of mud breccia recovered from gravity cores at the summit flow and at seep site 1 (Bohrmann et al., 2015) . However, where our methane concentrations approach the solubility limit atmospheric pressure (∼1 mmol/l) we are not able to determine whether these measurements reflect in situ concentrations, or whether degassing occurred fully. Sulfate and chloride concentrations were measured by ion chromatography using a Metrohm 882 Compact IC plus (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) on a Metrosep A Supp 5 column. Analytical errors below 0.4% were reported for both ions. Linear interpolation was used to approximate chloride, sulfate, and alkalinity concentrations at depths where samples for microbiology were taken. Lithium and boron samples were diluted 1:50, and potassium diluted 1:100, with 1% quartz-distilled nitric acid and run on a Leeman Labs Prodigy ICP-OES ion chromatograph using a radial viewing mode. IAPSO seawater and in-house solution standards were run every 11 samples and used to evaluate instrumental accuracy and precision. Detection limits were determined according to EPA method 200.7 (Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, 1996) . The limit of detection for potassium was 0.42 mM, while the limit of quantitation was 0.61 mM. High standards for lithium and boron were 10.2 and 327 µM, respectively. DNA was extracted using a modified sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-based DNA extraction protocol (Zhou et al., 1996) . Other DNA extraction methods, such as Mobio PowerSoil kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), or those detailed in Lever et al. (2015) produced much lower yields of genomic DNA that amplified less consistently. DNA extraction buffer was prepared as described in Zhou et al. (1996) and filtered through a 0.2-µm syringe filter. In a clean laminar flow hood, 0.3 g sediment, 550 µl extraction buffer, and 50 µl 20% 0.2 µl filtered-SDS were placed into autoclaved 1.5 ml internally threaded cryogenic vials (VWR, Radnor, PA, United States). Upon thawing, vials were vortexed at high speed for 5 min using a vortex affixed with a bead-beading adaptor (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Vials were sonicated in a roomtemperature water bath sonicator at 40 kHz (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) in two pulses of 30 s each, separated by 90 s, and then incubated in a 65 • C water bath for 1 h, inverting to resuspend flocculated sediment every 15-20 min. Vials were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to pellet sediment. Supernatants were combined with equal volumes of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) in 2 ml heavy phase lock gel tubes (Quantabio, Beverly, MA, United States) and continuously inverted for 4 min. Tubes were spun down at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and aqueous layers carefully transferred to clean tubes with 2.5× the aqueous volume of ethanol and 1 µl glycoblue coprecipitant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). DNA was precipitated at −20 • C for 2 h, and then pelleted by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 • C. Supernatant was carefully removed by pipetting and residual liquid was left to evaporate for 10-15 min. A subsequent salt wash was performed by adding 500 µl cold 70% ethanol and then centrifuging and removing the supernatant as before. Tubes were then placed in a Savant vacuum concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) at 55 • C for up to 10 min to evaporate any remaining liquid. DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 µl nuclease-free water and stored at −20 • C. Two DNA extraction blanks were conducted: one without any added sediment, and another with sediment that had been baked in an oven at 175 • C for 2 h. DNA was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer and High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) after extraction. 16S amplicons were prepared following the Earth Microbiome Project Illumina protocol. V4 regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified in triplicate 25 µl reactions using universal 515-forward and 806-reverse primers (Caporaso et al., 2011) modified with dual-indexed Illumina sequencing adapters (Kozich et al., 2013) . The thermal cycling protocol of Caporaso et al. (2011) was followed without modifications. After confirming amplification with agarose gel electrophoresis, triplicate PCR products were pooled and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In addition to the DNA extraction blanks, a sample without any added template DNA was amplified and purified as a PCR negative control. Amplicon concentrations were quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) using the Qubit dsDNA high sensitivity assay kit and pooled in equimolar amounts. Illumina MiSeq V2 paired-end 250 bp sequencing was performed at the Oregon State University Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB). 16S amplicon sequences were processed with version 1.39.3 of mothur (Schloss et al., 2009 ) following an established pipeline (Kozich et al., 2013) . Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level and taxonomically classified using version 128 of the SILVA database (Quast et al., 2013) . Singleton OTUs and contaminant genera were removed (for details on potential contaminants, see the section ""Results""). Communities were rarefied to 356 reads, and relative abundances and metrics of alpha diversity (richness and Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) were then calculated. To compare beta diversity, a tree file containing the most abundant sequence from each of the 11,572 OTUs was constructed with Clearcut (Evans et al., 2006) . A dissimilarity matrix was then calculated using weighted Unifrac distances (Lozupone et al., 2007) . Principal coordinates (PCO) analysis was conducted in PRIMER7 (Clarke and Warwick, 2001 ) from the community dissimilarity matrix and a Euclideannormalized environmental data matrix containing porewater chloride, methane, and sulfate concentrations corresponding to all samples. Distance-based linear modeling was used to evaluate the influence of these variables on community structure. Differences in community structure among sites and cores were evaluated using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) (Clarke, 1993) . Metastats (White et al., 2009 ) was used to determine whether individual OTUs showed patterns of differential abundance between communities based on chloride, methane, or sulfate concentrations and summit mud flow ages. Metagenomic DNA from samples was extracted using the procedure described above, with modifications to account for the increased sediment volumes. 8.4 g from sample GeoB19242-15 at 2-3 cm, 4.8 g from sample GeoB19263-1 at 48-52 cm, and 31.2 g from sample GeoB19263-1 at 267-270 cm were used. Volumes of extraction reagents were scaled up according to sediment masses. Samples were placed in 15 or 50 ml conical tubes, and centrifuging steps were carried out at 4,500 × g for 10 min when pelleting sediment and 1,500 × g for 5 min when extracting with phenol-chloroformisoamyl alcohol. Samples were precipitated at 4 • C for 12 h with 0.6 volume isopropanol and 0.1 volume sodium acetate in 2 ml tubes. Pellets were pooled, desalted with ethanol as described previously, resuspended in nuclease-free water, and DNA was then purified with a Norgen CleanAll DNA/RNA cleanup and concentration kit (Norgen Biotek, Thorold, Ontario, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions for genomic DNA (>10,000 bp). Metagenomic library construction and sequencing was conducted at the Josephine Bay Paul Center Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, MA, United States, using an established protocol available online 1 . To add to the three samples described here, fastq files from seven additional metagenomes derived from recent mud flows of the Håkon Mosby MV (Ruff et al., 2018) were downloaded from NCBI and analyzed in parallel. The ends of low-quality fastq sequences were removed using version 1.0-r72-dirty of the seqtk trimfq tool 2 . Paired reads were assembled with Megahit v1.1.1-2-g02102e1 (Li et al., 2015) and annotated in ShotMAP v1.1 (Nayfach et al., 2015) against the clusters of orthologous group (COG) protein family database (Galperin et al., 2015) using a classification threshold score of 42.8 and a coverage-based abundance calculation strategy. This classification method was more accurate than other pre-2018 pipelines in quantifying gene family abundances using the COG database (Franzosa et al., 2018) . Alpha diversity statistics were obtained across all three Venere and seven Håkon Mosby MV metagenomes using the ShotMAP script compare_shotmap_samples.pl. Percent abundances of reads annotated to each COG functional category were summed across samples. Reads annotated to multiple COG categories were omitted and percent abundances re-normalized to allow for comparison against other publicly available metagenomes from subsurface ecosystems annotated using the COG database. This information was obtained from the MG-RAST and IMG/M metagenome databases (Markowitz et al., 2014; Keegan et al., 2016) . To investigate microbial community changes during the extrusion and downslope transport of recently exposed, chloride-depleted mud breccia originating from the marine subsurface and the influence of seawater entrainment in such sediments, we collected samples for geochemical and microbial analyses from Venere MV offshore Calabria, Italy ( Figure 1A) . In the following, we describe results of DNA extractions/quality controls, geochemical trends that characterize Venere MV summit flow deposits, and then integrated geochemical and microbial community observations. We finally compare gene content from Venere MV metagenomes with that of another marine MV and additional marine subsurface environments. Table 1 includes relevant information from all cores organized by their sampling locations. Yield and Controls for DNA and 16S Amplicon Sequence Analysis DNA extraction yields from summit mud breccia sediments ranged across several orders of magnitude, from <0.12 to 145 ng per g bulk sediment. Yields were lowest in samples taken from depths below 40 cm in the summit gravity core, and higher in surface samples <10 cm below seafloor (cmbsf) and throughout gravity core GeoB19263 taken near seep site 3 just below the western summit ( Figure 1C) . Genomic DNA yields from push cores of the newer summit flow deposit (GeoB19242) were mostly below 2 ng per g, and push cores from the older flow further downslope showed increasing yields with distance from the summit (Supplementary Figure S1) . Mud breccia samples with added Escherichia coli genomic DNA recovered only 8.3% of the DNA compared to extractions with gDNA and no mud breccia. Therefore, in addition to the evident low biomass within these samples, sorption of DNA to clayey materials also likely reduced recovery. Faint amplification was observed in one DNA extraction blank, but not in another with baked sediment added to it, which suggests the mud breccia may contain PCR inhibitors. In addition, several samples intended for 16S amplicon sequencing failed to amplify. The low amounts of extracted DNA recovered from Venere MV samples necessitated extra scrutiny in identifying and removing potential contaminant sequences. Nineteen bacterial genera present at higher abundances in the three blanks than in 68 samples (α = 0.05) were removed, as were four genera previously identified as common laboratory or reagent contaminants in low-biomass samples (Salter et al., 2014) . The removed genera (listed in Supplementary Table S1) comprised six bacterial phyla and 81% of the sequences identified in blanks, but only 2.7% of Venere MV communities overall. Bacterial and Archaeal genera that were plotted in figures include the 13 genera that comprised >1% of all sequences in the dataset, and an additional six genera that were each over 0.3% of all sequences and were over 10% of any single community. Altogether, these 19 genera made up 72.5% of all sequences in the dataset. Gravity and push cores (GeoB19245-1 and 19258-15, respectively) collected at the Venere MV summit and downslope flow deposits show elevated concentrations of lithium and boron, and a depletion in potassium at depths just centimeters below seafloor (Figure 2) . These contrast markedly with trends seen in the gravity core from seep site 1 (GeoB19236-1), where these constituents reflect concentrations found in bottom waters. In samples from Venere MV summit flow deposits where microbial community samples were collected, porewater chloride and sulfate concentrations show a positive linear relationship (Figure 3 ). Chloride decreases with depth at the summit ( Figure 4A ). Because chloride changes occur at depths where lithium, boron, and potassium also deviate from seawater values, we interpret the coinciding decreases in chloride as a distinct geochemical transition between deep-sourced and seawater-influenced end-members.  Results are organized according to sampling areas or depths. First we show geochemical and microbial community data from gravity cores of Venere MV summit mud flow deposits and methane seep site 1, an area uninfluenced by recent mud breccia extrusion. These cores reach over 1 mbsf. We then present comparable data from push cores from the summit flow deposits and a reference site (without evidence of mud breccia extrusion or fluid seepage) that detail depths up to 20 cmbsf. Porewaters freshen markedly in gravity cores from the Venere MV summit and in cores GeoB19263-1 and GeoB19276-1, collected 80 and 150 m downslope along the mud flow ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, the site 1 seep core (GeoB19236-1) shows no evidence of porewater freshening even though sediments are mainly comprised of mud breccia. The deepsourced fluids in summit gravity cores are highly alkaline (40-60 mM) and depleted in sulfate, as are fluids from the site 1 seep ( Figure 4B ). Low sulfate/chloride ratios in gravity core samples from mud flow deposits downslope of the summit suggest the occurrence of microbial sulfate reduction (Figure 3) . The accumulation of methane below the sulfate reduction zone at seep site 1 ( Figure 4C) shows a sulfate-methane transition zone that suggests the presence of AOM. Methane concentrations in summit gravity cores range from 2 to 4 mM, but do not decrease with depth as conspicuously. Microbial communities at all depths of the summit gravity core show consistent relative abundances of Atribacteria, ANME-1b, and Anaerolineaceae ( Figure 4D ). Other methanotrophs are present in two cores 80 and 150 m downslope of the summit: ANME-2a-2b in GeoB19263-1, and several genera of aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria at 24 cmbsf in GeoB19276-1. Clostridia and Desulfobacteraceae, potential sulfur cyclers, are also more abundant in communities from downslope gravity cores. In contrast, the seep site 1 microbial community shows high abundances of several ANME clades throughout the core. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) SEEP-SRB1, which often associate with ANME to mediate AOM (Knittel et al., 2003) , are also present in high abundances. ROV-guided push cores taken from Venere MV summit and downslope from the mud breccia extrusion site also show significant freshening in porewater with chloride values of 200 mM measured only a few centimeters below seafloor, whereas the reference minicore GeoB19279-3 does not ( Figure 5A ). All cores, with the exception of the reference, show decreasing sulfate and increasing alkalinity with depth ( Figure 5B ). Methane concentrations in mud flow deposit cores were higher closer to the summit, but still exceeded 1 mM at 150 m downslope and generally did not drop off with depth ( Figure 5C ). Methane in the reference core porewater was detected in nanomolar amounts. As in the gravity cores, push core communities contained high abundances of Atribacteria and ANME-1b, particularly in core GeoB19242-12 near the summit ( Figure 5D ). However, methylotrophic Gammaproteobacteria were the most dominant community members in cores from the older mudflow sequence downslope of the summit. The top four OTUs from this group matched most closely to the genus Methylomonas, which are obligately aerobic type 1 methanotrophs capable of fixing nitrogen (Lidstrom, 2006) . High abundances of an OTU belonging to Ammonifex and most similar to Thermodesulfitimonas autotrophica, an anaerobic chemolithoautotroph (Slobodkina et al., 2017) , were present at similar or slightly deeper depths. The most abundant OTU, a marine group 1 methanotroph, is most closely related to Methylomonas methanica (Boden et al., 2011) . Bacterial and archaeal genera present in high abundance in summit flow communities were not present in shallow sediments of the reference site, which instead contained high abundances of Marine Group I Thaumarchaeota ( Figure 5D ). However, these communities were characterized by much higher alpha diversity than those from all other cores, with Chao1 indices of 606-782 compared to 153 or lower in mud breccia communities. A PCO ordination analysis was used to examine patterns of beta diversity among Venere MV microbial communities and their relation to porewater geochemical parameters (Figure 6 ). Two PCOs captured 54.1% of the community variance. Communities from Venere MV summit deposits showed the highest betadiversity, though a high degree of similarity was observed in communities from the summit gravity core. ANOSIM tests indicated differences in community structure between samples from older and younger summit mud breccia deposits, and between most cores (34 of 55 pairwise comparisons). However, when summit gravity core communities were reclassified as a distinct group instead of as younger mud flows, this difference disappeared (Supplementary Table S2 ). For this reason, and because they showed high similarity, summit gravity core communities were colored separately on the ordination (Figure 6 ). It is noteworthy that communities from seep site 1 and from a reference core were distinct from those inhabiting mud breccia flow deposits at or near the summit (Supplementary Table S2 ). Communities from these deposits recently extruded from kilometer-scale depths may require time to adapt to physical and/or geochemical conditions of a shallower marine subsurface environment. Porewater sulfate, methane, and chloride concentrations were all significant drivers of community structure (p ≤ 0.006), and, respectively, accounted for 8.6, 7.6, and 6.4% of the difference in community structure (22.6% of the total). Methane and sulfate vectors point in opposite directions on the PCO (Figure 6) , reiterating contrasting observations of methane-rich, sulfate-depleted fluids in summit and seep site 1 gravity cores compared to surface mud breccia deposits which have begun to entrain sulfate-rich seawater (Figures 4, 5) . On the other hand, direct trends between porewater chloride and community composition are not conveyed in the ordination (Figure 6) , which is likely obscured by the high beta-diversity among summit flow communities. Several abundant OTUs in Venere MV summit flows are present in communities at different abundances based on mud flow age, and methane or chloride concentrations (Supplementary Figure S2) . One aerobic methanotroph belonging to Methyloccocales was more dominant in older summit flow communities. Another, classified to Marine Methylotrophic Group 1, constituted nearly a quarter of the communities where methane was below 0.5 mM, suggesting it was active in removing methane from pore fluids. Atribacteria dominated methane-rich sediments, and two OTUs belonging to Desulfobacteraceae were more abundant in older deposits where methane concentrations still exceeded 2 mM. ANME-1b was the only OTU showing a preference for deeply sourced fluids with low chlorinity (Supplementary Figure S2C) . This ANME was presumably dead, dormant, or outcompeted by other populations as mud breccia was extruded from the Venere MV summit and exposed to a more oxidizing environment. Metagenomes were analyzed from three samples at Venere MV, a surface mud flow deposit near the Venere MV summit, and 50 and 267 cmbsf from gravity core GeoB 19263-1, 80 m downslope. COG category abundances from Venere MV metagenomes were similar to those of seven others from Håkon Mosby MV, off Norway in the Barents Sea (Ruff et al., 2018) . The diversity of COGs among all MV metagenomes did not vary significantly. However, these two MVs together showed a distinctly different composition of COG categories than metagenomes belonging to hydrothermal vent, basaltic crust, or sediment ecosystems (Figure 7 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Supplementary Table S4 contains additional information for other metagenomes compared, which either displayed COG category information in-text or online in MG-RAST or IMG/M databases. In particular, MV metagenomes showed higher abundances of reads classified to defense mechanisms (to combat viral attack) than the other three environments (Supplementary Figure S3) . In addition, higher content in the categories of cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, translation, and posttranslational modification came at the expense of energy production/conversion and amino acid transport and metabolism. These broad-level differences may hint at specialized adaptations that allow life to persist in a distinct deep subsurface environment. Mud volcanoes emit large quantities of methane into the oceans, contain fluids generated at depths from clay dewatering and convergent margin activity, and host methane-oxidizing chemosynthetic communities (Corselli and Basso, 1996; Fitts and Brown, 1999; Kopf, 2002 Kopf, , 2003 Niemann et al., 2006) . In this study, we sought to investigate linkages between methane, deepsourced fluids, and microbial community structure and gene content at a subseafloor MV to an unprecedented extent by characterizing microbial communities in freshly exposed mud breccia deposits at Venere MV within a geochemical context as they were extruded onto the seafloor. First we consider the geochemical nature of the deep fluids, then follow with a discussion of microbial gene content and metabolic potential, and FIGURE 7 | Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of COG functional category percent abundances among publicly available metagenomes from diverse marine subsurface environments.

Additional information is supplied in Supplementary Table S4. finally place microbial community changes within the context of this transitional environment. As interpreted previously by Loher et al. (2018c) , the decrease in pore water chloride at Venere MV summit and mud flow deposits appears to be the result of the upward advection and transport of deep-sourced fluids, which appear to be generated not from gas hydrate decomposition but by smectite-illite clay mineral dehydration reactions (Loher et al., 2018c) , which occur at temperatures between 60 and 150 • C (Kastner et al., 2014) . The estimated regional heat flow gradient of 0.020 • C/m and the thermogenic hydrocarbon signature documented at the summit of Venere MV point to a fluid source at depths of 3-7.5 km below the seafloor (Loher et al., 2018c) . Boron enrichment in pore waters typically results from clay particle desorption during mineral dehydration reactions or leaching from basalts at high (>150 • C) temperatures (Seyfried et al., 1984; Kopf and Deyhle, 2002) , processes which have repeatedly been documented by fluid analyses along convergent margin subduction zones (You et al., 1993 (You et al., , 1995 . Lithium may also be released from sediments and basalts at temperatures ranging from 51 to 350 • C (You et al., 1995; James et al., 2003) , which may point to fluid sources located deeper than smectite-illite transition depths, as in MVs from the Nankai accretionary wedge (Nishio et al., 2015) . At the Venere MV summit, porewater boron concentrations of up to 13 mM rank among the highest ever documented at MVs, which typically range below 5 mM (Kopf and Deyhle, 2002) . Porewater lithium values of several hundred micromolars at Venere MV are comparable in magnitude to the MVs of the Barbados convergent margin (Martin et al., 1996) , and exceed those of the Kumano MVs of the Nankai wedge (Nishio et al., 2015) . Boron and lithium enrichments have also been noted to infer fluid mobilization depths of 4-6 km below seafloor in the active Carmen MV in the western Mediterranean (López-Rodríguez et al., 2019) . Potassium concentrations below 1 mM in Venere MV pore fluids are without precedent, though values as low as 2.4 mM in MVs of the Barbados margin have been interpreted as incorporation of K + into the clay mineral illite during smectite diagenesis (Martin et al., 1996) . This phenomenon has been noted at other sites including the Ulleung basin (Kim et al., 2016) and Canadian Shield sedimentary deposits (Bottomley and Clark, 2004) . Together, the magnitudes of chloride and potassium depletions at Venere MV point toward considerable fluid generation from clay dewatering during smectite-illite clay mineral transformations at depth. Below 1 m, porewater chloride ( Figure 4A) , potassium, boron, and lithium (Figure 2) in the Venere MV summit gravity core do not change appreciably. This suggests that below this horizon, there is no admixture with seawater but that active upward advection of deeply sourced (>3 km) fluids maintained their highly altered fluid composition to depths as shallow as 50 cmbsf. The nonlinear nature of these profiles (Figures 4A,B) evinces a system out of steady-state conditions, wherein seawater has only begun to diffuse downward into the mud breccia to depths of 50 cm or less. To compare microbial communities with the potential nature of the fluid regime, we use low chlorinity (<200 mM) in Venere MV summit and mud flow deposits as a proxy for deepsourced fluids. Despite the considerable geochemical transition from deep-sourced to seawater-influenced fluids in Venere MV flow deposits, chloride concentration only explained 6.4% of the difference among microbial communities. This would suggest that communities in recently extruded mud breccia are affected only minimally by these deep fluids, or have not yet had the time to shift as they begin to mix with seawater and electron acceptors therein. Only one OTU, an ANME-1b, changed noticeably with chloride concentration (Supplementary Figure S2C) ; it may thus be inactive or outcompeted by other taxa considering that doubling times for anaerobic methane oxidizers are over a month, and that years may be required before they become dominant within communities (Girguis et al., 2005; Ruff et al., 2018) . Despite the low influence of deep fluids on community structure, clear patterns are noted in mud flow deposits with increasing distance from the extrusion site. The increased percent abundances of methyl-and methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Ammonifex, and unclassified Desulfobacteraceae (Figures 4, 5) likely reflect new growth instead of a decline in actual numbers of competing taxa. Higher abundances of these taxa in downslope cores may reflect proliferation in response to changes in physical conditions (such as changes in temperature and pressure), geochemical conditions (presence and nature of electron acceptors), and time after mud flow expulsion from the center conduit, which may allow methane to diffuse upward through flow deposits and possibly into the water column. Microbial groups present in mud breccia extruded from the main conduit at the western cone of Venere MV presumably have adaptations to high temperature environments, or are able to persist in a dormant state under considerable energy limitation for extended timescales (Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013) . Cell generation times in sediments can increase at least two orders of magnitude below sulfate-methane transition zones (Starnawski et al., 2017) . The high degree of similarity between Venere MV communities throughout summit gravity core samples across the transition from deep-sourced to seawater-influenced fluids (Figures 4, 6) suggests that community changes do not occur instantly, and that the few taxa therein represent an end-member deep-sourced microbial community signature from within the MV conduit. Thermophilic ANME-1 clades have been described at hydrothermal vents and sediments impacted by hydrothermal fluids (Teske et al., 2002; Brazelton et al., 2006) , while Atribacteria are understood to disperse through mud volcanism (Hoshino et al., 2017) . The functional and genomic potential within the class Anaerolineae is still poorly understood, but some members are considered to be anaerobic fermenters that show evidence of cellulolytic activity (Xia et al., 2016) . Additional investigations are needed to determine whether community members present in deep-sourced mud breccia constitute live and potentially active populations. Currently, only members of the bacterial phylum Firmicutes are understood to form endospores (Fritze, 2004) , and Clostridia are the only class of these present in significant amounts at Venere MV communities. In particular, Thermoanaerobacteraceae and Ammonifex contain hyperthermophilic chemolithotrophic members isolated from hot springs that employ hydrogen or formate as electron donors and several sulfur compounds as acceptors (Miroshnichenko et al., 2008; Slobodkina et al., 2017) . These groups are most prevalent in shallow push core sediments where sulfate is present (Figure 5 ), yet the sulfate in these deposits is consistent with a mixing ratio with deep-sourced fluids and seawater as end members, suggesting an absence of ongoing sulfate reduction (Figure 3) . Microbial communities at MVs display high variability, though several keystone OTUs involved in methane and sulfur metabolism occur in these systems, particularly members of ANME, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria (Pachiadaki and Kormas, 2013) . Methanotrophic communities are restricted to surface sediments at the center of the active Håkon Mosby MV, which is characterized by a dynamic gas hydrate system (Pape et al., 2011) . ANMEs at Håkon Mosby MV are active in peripheral zones, where lower rates of deeply sourced fluid flow allow sulfate to permeate deeper into the sediment column (Niemann et al., 2006) . Studies of recent deposits at this location identified additional populations similar to those found at Venere MV, including Atribacteria and Chloroflexi associated with the subsurface conduit, and sulfate reducers and sulfur oxidizers in surface-exposed mud deposits (Ruff et al., 2018) . In addition, high abundances of Methylococcales (up to 20%) have been found to characterize communities of active MVs in the Mediterranean compared to inactive ones nearby (Coelho et al., 2016) . In contrast to active methanogens described at other MVs (Lazar et al., 2012) or deep biologically sourced methane described at other accretionary margins (Ijiri et al., 2018) , the low abundance of sequences belonging to canonical methanogens (0.7%) and thermogenic isotopic signatures of hydrocarbons at the summit of Venere MV suggests that microbial methane production is negligible. Based on preliminary comparisons with other marine subsurface ecosystems, the distinct gene content in MV metagenomes (Figure 7) likely reflects functional adaptations in community members that may not be endemic to MVs, but are nevertheless highly abundant therein. Elevated percentages of defense mechanism COGs in MV metagenomes are suggestive of diversified adaptations against viral attack (Makarova et al., 2013) , though viral diversity may select against certain defense elements (such as CRISPR-Cas systems) from the genome (Weinberger et al., 2012) . Viruses can outnumber bacterial and archaeal cells in subsurface environments by one to two orders of magnitude (Engelhardt et al., 2014; Nigro et al., 2017) , and as such, their influence on microbial community dynamics and evolution within MVs should be topics of future investigation. Compared to basalts and hydrothermal environments, the higher percentages of COGs related to translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis in MVs suggest smaller average genome sizes (Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2004) . The gain, loss, or modification of cell membrane genes in populations of Sulfurovum has been implicated to be adaptations to hydrothermal environments (Anderson et al., 2017) ; these forces could also explain high percent abundances of cell membrane COGs in MVs. With the exception of amino acids, the similar abundances of metabolic COG categories between MVs and other subsurface environments could imply that metabolic gene content across subsurface environments is somewhat homogenous at a broad level of classification. Further analyses of MV metagenomes should continue characterizing metabolisms involved in biogeochemical cycles, and pay particular attention to specific adaptations to temperature, pressure, or the unique geochemistry of deep-sourced fluids these microbial genomes could hold. Microbial community changes have been characterized across transitional subsurface environments in many settings. Increased diversity observed in aging basalt outcrops has been explained by geochemical changes, such as the accretion of organic matter and allochthonous minerals, that could support a wide variety of metabolisms (Lee et al., 2015) . In contrast (Woycheese et al., 2015) , observed a decrease in diversity in serpentinizing seep fluids after they were exposed to the atmosphere and a select few genera became dominant. It took around 2 years for alpha diversity to increase in freshly exposed muds at Håkon Mosby MV, despite available electron donors and acceptors (Ruff et al., 2018) . Patterns of alpha diversity in Venere MV mud flow deposits are not apparent, and thus may reflect a similar time dependency. The observation that Venere MV mud flow microbial community composition was influenced by methane and sulfate availability is suggestive of energy limitation, which has also been found to structure communities in deep sediments of the South China Sea (Graw et al., 2018) . Preliminary IODP data from Expedition 370 found that subsurface temperatures above 65 • C can drastically restrict cell numbers (Heuer et al., 2017) . Incomplete heat flow data from shallow Venere MV deposits prevented us from determining the influence of temperature on community composition. Decreasing pressure as fluidized muds are transported upward may represent another physical factor that potentially influences microbial community composition (Bartlett et al., 2007; Myka et al., 2017) . Differences observed between communities from the Venere MV summit gravity core and nearby downslope deposits may indicate additional geochemical or physical forces at play, though community assembly may be stochastic to some extent (Stegen et al., 2012) . Similar to microbial communities in extruded mud breccia flows of the Håkon Mosby MV (Ruff et al., 2018) , we observed increases in SRB (Desulfobacteraceae and SEEP-SRB1) with time and distance from the MV summit, mirroring trends in genomic DNA concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1) . These changes were particularly evident in cores with high porewater chloride but low sulfate, which points toward ongoing microbial sulfate reduction (Figure 3) . Populations of ANME did not change or increase in abundance, though ANME-2a-2b were one notable exception, present in downslope gravity cores and also at the more mature seep site 1 (Figure 4D) . We postulate that mud breccia deposits closest to the summit (<80 m) are too young for ANME populations to have developed. If community successional patterns align with those described by Ruff et al. (2018) , these flows were likely extruded less than 2 years ago, and push core communities dominated by aerobic methanotrophs may be even less than a year old. This is in line with findings by Loher et al. (2018a) who documented morphological changes near the western summit of Venere MV between 2014 and 2016 that support its active status. Nevertheless, the high abundances of aerobic methyl-and methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria in recently exposed MV surface sediments are somewhat unexpected. These groups dominate downslope push cores that are lower in methane than others closer to the summit ( Figure 5C ), but they are highly abundant >20 cmbsf into the low-chloride and presumably oxygen-free mud breccia fluids, inhabiting the same depths as obligate anaerobic genera such as Ammonifex. Although Gammaproteobacteria have been shown to dominate bioturbated sediments and maintain endosymbioses with Siboglinid polychaete worms (Thornhill et al., 2008) , no macrofauna were found in Venere MV summit flow deposits. One possible mechanism of delivering oxygen from bottom water into the mud breccia would be via advection through the plated and fractured surface structure of the most recently extruded mud breccia. Testing this hypothesis would require oxygen measurements, which are presently not available. AOM by bacteria is not without precedent: Methylomirabilis, of the NC10 phylum, uses nitrite to generate oxygen and oxidize methane using a particulate methane monooxygenase homologous to those found in aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Ettwig et al., 2010) . Although the typically clay-rich matrix composition of mud breccia would limit diffusion rates, the low biomass in Venere MV summit mud flow deposits may not consume oxygen very quickly. Bottom seawater penetration into recently extruded mud breccia could also explain the delivery of methylotrophic Gammaproteobacteria into shallow mud breccia depths, as these groups normally persist in bottom waters (Tavormina et al., 2010) or at the sediment-water interface, and were not detected in deep sediments from the summit GC. Additional constraints on mud flow dynamics, pore fluid movement, and geochemical interfaces are needed to better understand how microbial communities respond to a highly dynamic environment. The active Venere MV, located on the CAP offshore Italy, emits fluids and mud breccia sourced from kilometer-scale depths within sediments that are depleted in sulfate and chloride with respect to seawater. Microbial communities inhabiting summit mud flow deposits are distinct from those at reference and peripheral methane seepage sites. Downslope mud breccia communities contain several clades of aerobic methyl-and methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria, while ANMEs and SRB develop in older mud breccia deposits further from the summit. Spatiotemporal succession patterns of similar communities from another MV suggest that Venere MV flows may have been extruded less than 2 years ago. Microbial gene content from both of these MVs is distinct from that of other marine subsurface habitats, and likely reflects adaptations to a unique environment.

18110353,Increased methane emissions from deep osmotic and buoyant convection beneath submarine seeps as climate warms,"Large methane hydrates reserves are found in mud volcanoes, but climate change may lead to methane release. Here, the authors show that methane adsorption creates overpressures leading to rapid recirculation of seawater, thus reducing the melting timescales of methane hydrates from millennia to decades.","tantly there is concern that anthropogenic climate change could destabilize hydrates, thereby potentially releasing large quantities of methane into the ocean and atmosphere [3, 4, 5] . Thus there are both environmental and economic reasons to be interested in methane associated with seeps and mud volcanism. A mud volcano is a geological structure on land or in the oceans in which water plus fine particulates -'mud' -issues from a conduit typically topped by a conical hill with a crater. The emerging mud is generally accompanied by methane, both dissolved and, if the concentration exceeds the saturation concentration, as bubbles [6] . A submarine seep, on the other hand, has similar fluid flow through the porous sediment constituting the seabed without the conical structure or open conduit. What physical forces drive such fluid flows? We find that both buoyancy and osmotic effects are present in cold seeps and mud volcanism in which, rather than being a passive element, methane is its driving force. Some researchers have suggested the importance of considering osmosis in seeps and mud volcanism [7, 8] . Clays and shales are known to possess the semipermeability necessary for osmosis, associated with charge and pore-size effects [9, 10] . Moreover, methane hydrates frequently exist in the sediments around a cold seep or mud volcano [6, 2] . As hydrate forms, the sediment plus hydrate becomes progressively less permeable [11, 12] . However, other mechanisms involving adsorption and chemical reaction can also produce significant osmotic pressures [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] . Methane is shown to adsorb onto sediments [21, 22, 23, 24] . Hydrates form in pores under a wider range of conditions than in the bulk [25] and methane molecules adsorb onto the cages of methane hydrate during the hydrate growth process [26, 27] . Thus, we propose below that given a supply of methane, a submarine cold seep or mud volcano can function as a geological instance of an osmotic pump [9, 28, 29] . We find cause for concern that this convective pump mechanism facilitates methane hydrate destabilization under anthropogenic climate change.  Consider the possible physical driving forces for a submarine seep in which salty water and methane are driven out of the seabed (Fig. 1) . The origin for this water can be either a reservoir beneath the seabed or seawater itself, recirculated within the porous seabed. One commonly discussed flow mechanism is the expulsion of pore water from sediments under compression, which can yield a speed of some v sc = 1.8 × 10 −3 m yr −1 [30] . This estimate provides a baseline with which to compare mechanisms. Buoyancy and osmotic forces are other possible driving mechanisms. Let us consider quantitatively the processes for fluid transport in a cold seep in which the sea bed consists of a homogeneous porous medium, within which, at a given depth beneath the seafloor, we position (Fig. 1a) an extended source of buoyancy, caused by either a thermal or a compositional difference, or (Fig. 1b) a two-dimensional source of buoyancy, such as that at a continental margin. Much previous work has explored the occurrence of flow focussing in overpressured heterogeneous sediments [31, 32] . We further consider the case (Fig. 1c) in which the sediment is heterogeneous, so that focussed flow may occur above a source of buoyancy or osmotic effects; for example, methane dissolved in warm water, the porous medium being semipermeable to this methane. We estimate the rate of flow of water induced in each case. We should mention that there exists a further buoyancy-driven flow mechanism, that of liquid flow driven by buoyant bubbles [33] , but this becomes dominant only with very large gas fluxes; that is, during the eruptive phase of mud volcanism, while here we concentrate on flows during the quiescent phase that subsists ∼ 95% of the time [6] . The effectiveness of each mechanism of pumping fluid depends of course on the permeability of the sediment. Measurements at seeps indicate values for inter-granular permeability in the range 10 −18 -10 −14 m 2 [34] . However, it has been suggested [34, 35, 36] that bulk permeabilities are much higher, of the order of 10 −12 m 2 , owing to channelling of fluid through the sediment. Below we assume a bulk permeability k = 10 −12 m 2 and later extend our results to the range of permeabilities 10 −13 -10 −11 m 2 . Positive buoyancy forces can arise from a temperature gradient that heats the water, or from solutal sources. For example, heat is released when methane hydrates form and lower-density fresh water is generated when hydrates dissociate (Fig. 1a) . When buoyancy from a geological process is released over a large area at depth in an otherwise quiescent, saturated porous medium, the less-dense fluid rises above the source (Fig. 1a) . In a homogeneous sediment, the upward flow is essentially one-dimensional and we estimate (Methods) flow speeds v est ∼ 0.15 m yr −1 and v ess ∼ 0.75 m yr −1 for thermal and solutal convection, respectively. Consider now the release of heat over a long, thin area such as a continental margin. The rise of the warm fluid is now more localized, forming a line or two-dimensional plume (transverse view in Fig. 1b) . The plume increases in width as it rises, owing to viscous drag and to transverse heat conduction. The rise velocity of the warm fluid decreases with height as a consequence of cooling and the consequent reduction of buoyancy, while the volumetric flow rate increases on account of the increase in plume width. We consider a heat source of strength F t = 25 J m −1 s −1 at a depth H = 100 m to be consistent with observations of surface heat fluxes of the order of 0.12 J m −2 s −1 measured at the northern Cascadia accretionary sedimentary prism [37] . The upward liquid speed at the seafloor is then estimated (Methods) as v lst = 0.25 m yr −1 , the half-width of the plume is b lst = 87 m and the total flow rate per unit length is Q lst = 43 m 2 yr −1 . A similar plume flow develops when less dense fluid is released in a localized region at depth, for example water liberated through methane hydrate dissociation [38] or during the smectite-illite transformation [39] . In a given case, the chlorinity of interstitial pore water sampled at a seep site is about 0.95 times that of seawater [34] , suggesting dilution of low salinity water from depth with seawater by a factor of the order of 20. Also, heat balances over active seep areas taking into account measured background thermal gradients have suggested dilution of the original water from depth with seawater by a factor of 6 to 30 [39] . Constraining the plume flow here to a dilution factor of 20 allows us to estimate (Methods) the original source fluid flow rate Q 0 = 0.16 m 2 yr −1 , so that the the total flow rate per unit length at the seafloor is Q lss = 3.1 m 2 yr −1 . We estimate the plume speed v lss = 0.13 m yr −1 and half-width b lss = 12 m. This source flow rate is consistent with values quoted for the release of water by the smectite-illite transformation and the hydrate layer [39] . For comparison, consider now a buoyant flow in a heterogeneous porous medium under a seep (Fig. 1c) . We assume focussed flow directly under the seep area has increased the local permeability so that the main resistance to flow arises in the drawing of seawater from the surroundings into the rising seep plume. Osmotic forces arise from a compositional gradient of fluid within a medium possessing a degree of semipermeability. Let us consider the flow induced by the osmotic pressure gradient associated with a release of fresh water saturated with methane at depth in the same heterogeneous porous medium under a seep (Fig. 1c) . The water at the seafloor, above and be-yond the seep region, is free from methane owing to continuous motion of ocean currents. We expect seawater to flow downward from the seafloor into the porous sediment and towards the region with high concentration of methane. The methane in solution may diffuse into and through the surrounding seawater-saturated porous sediment. A mixture of the source freshwater with methane and seawater will eventually rise in the form of an osmotic plume, exiting at the seafloor as a seep flow. We predict (Methods) a vertical velocity of v so ∼ 571 m yr −1 for an osmotic source at depth H = 100 m and a dilution ratio of 20. The total flow rate in the convective cell is Q so = 5919 m 3 yr −1 . The effluent flux of methane averaged over the inflow area is approximately 0.025 mol m −2 yr −1 . These scaling and numerical results suggest that liquid efflux from the seabed in seep regions driven by osmotic pumping can be at least 10 times larger than in seeps with convection induced by salinity and thermal differences. It is also far larger than reported velocities for water expulsion resulting from sediment compression. Lastly, let us consider both buoyant and osmotic circulation in the vicinity of a fully-developed mud volcano with a fractal network of smaller channels at depth leading to the main central conduit, like a tree roots and trunk, above a source of solute or/and heat. Consider an idealized version of the geometry of the conduits: a vertical main channel, through which water with dissolved methane flows upwards from side feeder channels at depth and exits at the seafloor (Fig. 1d) . Here, we consider the drawdown of water from the seabed caused by buoyant or osmotic pressure associated with a solute in solution in these conduits. Each conduit thus behaves like a buoyant or osmotic source considered above. Such network flows have been considered for many systems, from rivers in geology to the vascular system and the lungs in biology; our case corresponds to a directed spanning tree, the most efficient class of networks [41] . We find that the speed of the flow in the main conduit is proportional to the total lateral area of all the feeder conduits (Methods). The combination of a buoyant or osmotic pump and a very small volume fraction of conduits within the sediment produces flow rates orders of magnitude larger than that in a homogeneous porous medium alone. The convective pump mechanism that we have demonstrated here functions as an amplifier of a small external source of buoyancy or dissolved methane into a large quantity of water that cycles through the seep or volcano. The question of the provenance of the water is a telling datum. The dominant contribution to the water issuing from submarine seeps and mud volcanoes is not water from reservoirs under the seafloor, but seawater [42, 43, 44, 45] . In Fig. 2 we present a comparison of in-situ measurements of liquid and methane fluxes from cold seeps [30, 46] and mud volcanoes [47, 48] with our theoretical predictions. It is clear that thermal and solutal convection alone cannot explain the very high velocities measured at methane-rich sites with low permeability sediments. Contrariwise, osmosis induced by methane is likely to be the physical mechanism responsible for some of these high velocities, as revealed by the orange shaded ellipse. Indeed, even with a conservative estimate of the osmotic effect, osmotic pressure gradients are capable of producing very fast flows. The fluids vented at these seep sites had concentrations of dissolved methane in the range 0.6-126 µM. Osmosis is an efficient mechanism for producing fast localized flows owing to the relatively large pressure differences it generates. While for the buoyant seep considered above the pressure driving the convective cell is of the order of 4400 Pa, in the osmotic seep a pressure of 19400 Pa is achieved. Fluid flow into the seabed in the vicinity of a seep has been observed; this flow pattern is difficult to understand from non-convective mechanisms. Measurements of downward speeds have been reported of 0.02-1.6 m yr −1 in the vicinity of methane vents in the Gulf of Mexico [49] and of 0.1-0.5 m yr −1 in Hydrate Ridge, Cascadia [40, 50] . These measurements may be compared with a predicted downward velocity at the seafloor surrounding the seep of approximately 3.1 m yr −1 for the osmotic flow, but only 0.38 m yr −1 for the buoyant case, so the faster downward flows, at least, should be owing to osmosis. Our prediction of localized venting driven by osmosis is consistent with observations of seep regions in the Gulf of Mexico involving cold and dense saline effluent, where buoyancy can not drive the flow [51, 52, 53] . There is at present just one measurement of flow rates in a mud volcano conduit, of 400 km yr −1 at a conduit of the Håkon Mosby mud volcano with radius 0.2 m (Mud volcano II [47] ; the other mud volcano measurement we plot, Mud volcano I [48] , corresponds not to a conduit, but to flow through a porous medium, as at a seep). This conduit flow measurement is compatible with our theoretical estimate for a mud volcano that predicts that the exit speed in a main conduit will be increased in proportion to the total lateral area of the network of conduits. Given a tiny volume fraction of 0.00001% of the porous medium forming feeder conduits for a main conduit, we predict such high-speed flows can be driven by both buoyancy or osmosis. This is a measure of how much more efficient than a seep a mud volcano is at pumping seawater. Our model shows that recirculation of seawater within the seabed is rather greater and deeper than previously understood. While earlier models have considered convection of seawater in shallow layers of sediment of only a few metres depth [39, 34, 38] , here we have deduced that convection can extend to the depth of the source of buoyancy or dissolved methane. Such flow can cool the sediment column by up to 1.3 × 10 7 J m −2 yr −1 per unit temperature difference between the seawater and the seep effluent. Measurements of outflow temperatures at seeps indicate a temperature elevated by 0 -5 K relative to seawater [2] . So we predict a maximum heat flux of 6×10 7 J m −2 yr −1 associated with convection in the sediment. We therefore envisage that recirculation of seawater to hundreds of metres depth will be problematic under conditions of climatic warming, as buried methane hydrates below seep and mud-volcano sites will be much more susceptible to destabilization than has been recognized up to now. Previous studies have estimated a timescale of millennia for conduction of heat from warmer seawater at the seafloor to affect the base of a hydrate layer at a few hundred metres depth and promote melting [3, 4, 5] . However, under enhanced heat transport by both buoyant and osmotic convection, we predict that the melting of hydrates could begin within timescales as short as 30 years. Such accelerated heat transport by convection will also increase the rate of melting of some hydrates by a factor of up to 100 compared to the heat conduction scenario previously studied (see Methods). The release of methane to the hydrosphere may thus occur much sooner and faster than previously thought. Such a continuous intense release of methane at the seabed will form a plume of rising methane bubbles that may reach the upper water column [47, 54, 55] . It is challenging to assess what portion of the global inventory of methane hydrate, estimated as 1.8×10 3 Gt C [56] , might be susceptible to warming by the mechanism described here. For this, we need to combine oceanographic predictions for the warming of the upper few hundred metres of the ocean with hydrate stability studies. It is thought [57] that marine deepwaters on upper continental slopes (up to a few hundred metres depth), at the edge of the gas hydrate stability zone, encompass some 3.5 % of the global hydrate inventory. It is also known [4] that shallow waters down to a few hundreds of metres respond to climate change in roughly 10 years, while deep waters at 1-3 km take longer, 100-1000 years. Based on these estimates, a maximum of about 3.5 % of the global hydrate inventory (∼ 60 Gt C) might be susceptible to warming by the mechanism proposed here within a timescale of a few decades.  The subscripts es, lst, lss, so, and ss denote an extended source of buoyancy, a thermal margin plume, a solutal margin plume, a seep driven by osmosis and a seep driven by buoyancy, respectively. The subscripts 'single' and 'network' refer to a single conduit and a network of conduits in a mud volcano. A buoyancy-viscosity balance suggests a velocity v es ∼ k∆ρg/µ driven by the density difference between the surrounding, less dense liquid ∆ρ. For a thermally-driven flow ∆ρ = ρβ t ∆T = 2 kg m −3 for a temperature difference ∆T = 10 K [37] and ρ = 1000 kg m −3 . For a solutal source of buoyancy, the maximum density difference driving the flow can be estimated to be smaller than ∆ρ = 10 kg m −3 taking into account salinity differences [34] and heat absorbed during methane hydrate dissociation. For the properties of water, we take the thermal expansion coefficient β t = 2 × 10 −4 K −1 and the viscosity µ = 1.8 × 10 −3 kg m −1 s −1 . The vertical velocity at the centreline of a plume at a distance H above the source is v lst = (kβ t gF t /(µC p )) 2/3 (3/(32κ m H)) 1/3 and the plume half-width is b lst = (48µC p κ 2 m H 2 /(kβ t gF t )) 1/3 [58] . The thermal diffusion coefficient of the saturated sediment is κ m = 10 −7 m 2 s −1 ; g is the acceleration of gravity. The specific heat capacity of water is C p = 4.2 × 10 3 J kg −1 K −1 . The plume velocity is v lss = (k∆ρgQ 0 /µ) 2/3 (3/(32D s H)) 1/3 and the plume half-width is b lss = (48µD 2 s H 2 /(k∆ρgQ 0 )) 1/3 . We take the effective diffusivity of the solute causing the density difference, e.g., salt, in the porous medium as D s = 10 −9 m 2 s −1 , and ∆ρ = 10 kg m −3 as before. For pumping driven by osmosis, the porous medium behaves as only partially permeable to methane because a fraction of methane molecules of up to 0.6 are adsorbed [30, 22] and later released by the sediment. This adsorption creates a change of momentum in the methane molecules that leads to a reflection coefficient of σ 0 < 0.6 [22, 19, 17, 59] . For the pressure and temperature conditions in the seep data in Fig. 2 [21, 23, 24] . Seawater of course contains another solute, sodium chloride (other solutes found in seep water have much lower concentrations [44, 45] ); we may neglect the osmotic effect of sodium and chloride ions because size-restriction effects in the sediment are very small for the permeabilities considered here [9, 28] . The semipermeability of the sediment to methane creates an osmotic pressure difference between the seawater and the methane-rich fluid released at depth of p 0 = σ 0 c 0 RT ; here, R is the universal gas constant and T ∼ 283 K is the temperature. A balance of osmotic and viscous forces gives the scale for the flow rate of seawater drawn into the osmotic plume Q so ∼ 2πakp 0 /µ. This flow will be channelled upwards towards the seafloor in a plume within the high permeability sediment column below the seep. Consistent with seafloor observations, we assume a radius of a = 2 m for this column [40, 2] . The vertical velocity in the plume is v so ∼ Q so /(πa 2 ). Numerical simulations neglecting the resistance in the upward flow compared to the downward and radial flow confirm this scaling, with a coefficient of 1.4 for seeps spaced at 50 m and a dilution ratio of the original source fluid of 20. We estimate a vertical effluent speed v so ∼ 471 m yr −1 . The vertical downward speed at the seafloor surrounding the seep is of the order of u so = 3.1 m yr −1 . For pumping driven by buoyancy, the pressure difference between the seawater and the hot or fresh fluid released at depth is p 0 = ∆ρgH. A balance of buoyancy and viscous forces gives the scale for the flow rate of seawater drawn into the buoyant plume Q ss ∼ 2πakp 0 /µ. Numerical simulations neglecting the resistance in the upward flow compared to the downward and radial flow confirm this scaling, with a coefficient of 0.35 for seeps spaced at 50 m and a dilution ratio of the original source fluid of 20. We estimate a vertical effluent speed v ss ∼ 59 m yr −1 . The vertical downward speed at the seafloor surrounding the seep is of the order of u ss = 0.38 m yr −1 . A similar balance of buoyant/osmotic and viscous forces applies as for a seep, with the plume radius a replaced by the conduit radius, R c . Thus, for a single vertical conduit, the effluent speed v single ∼ Q so /(πR 2 c ) is to leading order independent of the conduit length. For a network of conduits, with the simplifying assumptions that one conduit domain has no impact on the others and the viscous resistance to flow in the network is small compared to that in the porous medium, the flow rate is proportional to the sum of the lateral surface areas A i of all the individual conduits; the exit velocity in the main conduit is then v network = v single A i /A single . The exit speed thus depends on lengths and radii of the feeder conduits extending about the main conduit. For a single vertical conduit of radius R c = 0.2 m, we predict a maximum speed of v single ∼ 3000 m yr −1 . v network can be several orders of magnitude larger than this: to achieve a hundredfold increase to v network ∼ 3 × 10 5 m yr −1 , for example, the lateral surface area of conduits needed is A i ∼ 100 · 1000 · 0.2 ∼ 10 4 m 2 , for H = 1000 m and R c = 0.2 m. Assuming feeder-conduit radii r c ∼ 0.01 m, the corresponding volume of these conduits is ∼ 10 2 m 3 . The recirculation volume of the porous medium is ∼ 1000 · 1000 2 = 10 9 m 3 . So, a hundredfold increase in the exit speed requires just a fraction of 10 −7 of the recirculation volume of the porous medium to be conduits. The time of travel of a thermal signal from the seafloor to the base of the hydrate layer (where melting occurs) is approximately given by H/u, where H is the distance from the seafloor to the base of the hydrate layer and u is the superficial or Darcy vertical speed of the seawater moving downward in the sediment surrounding the seep or mud volcano. u was estimated from the scaling expressions above and confirmed by numerical simulation. The ratio of the heat flux associated with convection of seawater downward into the sediment and that associated with conduction is the Péclet number P e = uH/κ. We find P e ∼ 100 for the osmotic seep. The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article. ",Silvana Cardoso,2016,27807343,10.1038/ncomms13266
24389953,"Methanogenic diversity and activity in hypersaline sediments of the centre of the Napoli mud volcano, Eastern Mediterranean Sea","Submarine mud volcanoes are a significant source of methane to the atmosphere. The Napoli mud volcano, situated in the brine-impacted Olimpi Area of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, emits mainly biogenic methane particularly at the centre of the mud volcano. Temperature gradients support the suggestion that Napoli is a cold mud volcano with moderate fluid flow rates. Biogeochemical and molecular genetic analyses were carried out to assess the methanogenic activity rates, pathways and diversity in the hypersaline sediments of the centre of the Napoli mud volcano. Methylotrophic methanogenesis was the only significant methanogenic pathway in the shallow sediments (0-40 cm) but was also measured throughout the sediment core, confirming that methylotrophic methanogens could be well adapted to hypersaline environments. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway below 50 cm; however, low rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were also present, even in sediment layers with the highest salinity, showing that these methanogens can thrive in this extreme environment. PCR-DGGE and methyl coenzyme M reductase gene libraries detected sequences affiliated with anaerobic methanotrophs (mainly ANME-1) as well as Methanococcoides methanogens. Results show that the hypersaline conditions in the centre of the Napoli mud volcano influence active biogenic methane fluxes and methanogenic/methylotrophic diversity.","Large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane are stored in marine sediments 2 (Kvenvolden, 1988) . Methane is also emitted from these sediments, sometimes 3 ascending from deep sources along channels or conduits reaching the seafloor, 4 creating structures such as pockmarks or mud volcanoes. Submarine mud volcanoes 5 are typically found at various tectonically active and passive continental margins, 6 from which mud and fluids (water, brine, gas, oil) flow or erupt (Milkov, 2000) . They 7 are considered a significant source of atmospheric carbon, especially methane 8 (Dimitrov, 2003) . Mud volcanoes are typically driven by overpressured subsurface 9 sediment in subduction zones of continental margins. They can erupt violently or 10 gently extrude semi-liquid mud-volcano breccia (Dimitrov, 2003) . Over 200 mud 11 volcanoes have been found along the northern flank of the Mediterranean Ridge in 12 the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Charlou et al., 2003) . The formation of the 13 Mediterranean Ridge is linked to the collision between the African and Eurasian 14 tectonic plates, resulting in intensive faulting (Haese et al., 2006) . The Napoli mud 15 volcano is a circular dome situated in the Olimpi area (Fig. 1 ). This mud volcano has 16 ascending brine fluids characterized by pools and lakes with diameter size ranging 17 from centimeters to meters (Charlou et al., 2003) . Fauna are present on the summit 18 (active inner zone), whereas in the outer zone most fauna are dead, suggesting that 19 chemosynthetic activity is limited due to the brines and fluid flows (Olu-Le Roy et al., 20 2004) . 21 Most of the gas venting from these mud volcanoes is composed of methane, mainly 22 of biogenic origin (Charlou et al., 2003) which is produced by methanogenic Archaea. 23 Methanogenesis is the ultimate terminal oxidation process in the anaerobic 24 degradation of organic matter. Methanogens are divided into three metabolic groups 25 based on substrates used: hydrogenotrophs use H 2 /CO 2 , acetoclasts use acetate, 26 and methylotrophs use methylated compounds (Garcia et al., 2000) . Few studies 27 have specifically focused on activity or diversity of methanogens in cold seeps and 28 mud volcanoes (Dhillon et al., 2005; Kendall et al., 2006) , and only eight 29 methanogens belonging to six different genera have been cultured and isolated from 30 cold seeps (Sowers et al., 1983 , 1984 , von Klein, 2002 , Mikucki et al., 2003 , Shlimon 31 et al., 2004 , Singh et al., 2005 , Kendall et al., 2006 , 2007 . Most (>90%) of the 32 uprising methane is consumed by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) before it 33 reaches the seafloor (Knittel et al., 2009) . AOM is driven by methanotrophic ArchaeaF o r P e e r R e v i e w O n l y (ANME), and is often coupled to Desulfosarcinales-and Desulfobulbus-related 35 bacteria, as sulfate-reducing partners (Boetius et al., 2000; Knittel et al., 2005; 36 Niemann et al., 2006) . Based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, AOM in marine 37 environments is mediated by three distinct clusters of Euryarchaeota, namely ANME-38 1, ANME-2 and ANME-3. These clusters are phylogenetically related to the orders 39 Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales which include cultivated methanogens 40 (Lösekann et al., 2007) . 41 The maximum activity of a mud volcano is generally located at the center where 42 methane-rich muds and fluids are freshly expelled from a deep reservoir. In Napoli, 43 methane to ethane ratios and δ CH 4 values (-65.6‰PDB, Charlou et al., 2003) 44 indicate that methane is biogenic. Napoli mud volcano deep-sourced brine fluids 45 (Charlou et al., 2003) impact on the geochemistry, and thereby, potentially microbial 46 diversity and activities. However, the methanogenic community diversity and activity 47 in the active centers of mud volcanoes has not yet been described. Hence in this 48 study, pathways for biogenic methane production, community structure and activities 49 of methanogens in the center of the Napoli mud volcano were assessed. Rates of the 50 three main metabolic types of methanogenesis were measured, together with the 51 distribution of Archaea, including methanogens by 16S rRNA gene PCR-DGGE, as 52 similarity to sequences from hypersaline sediments of the Gulf of Mexico (Lloyd et al., 105 2006) . Selection of sediment samples for clone libraries of mcrA genes was based on 106 the measured peaks in methanogenic activities ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material. 107 SM2), at depth sections 40-60, 60-80, and 100-120 cmbsf. A total of 42 mcrA 108 sequences from sediment depths 40 to 60 cmbsf, 29 from depths 60 to 80 cmbsf, 109 and 40 from depths 100 to 120 cmbsf were analyzed. Rarefaction curves generated 110 for mcrA clones obtained from the 3 sections indicated saturation (Supplementary 111 Material. SM3), while percent coverage was determined to be 87%, 73% and 71% for 112 40-60, 60-80 and 100-120 cmbsf respectively for the clone libraries. The mcrA 113 phylotypes at 40 to 60 and 100 to 120 cmbsf were mainly affiliated with the ANME-1 114 (mcrA group a/b, Fig. 4 ). Some sequences were also closely related to the ANME-2a 115 (mcrA group e) and with methylotrophic methanogens of the Methanococcoides (Fig.  116 4, Supplementary Material. SM4). In the 60 to 80 cmbsf sediment sections, all mcrA 117 gene sequences were affiliated with the ANME-1 cluster probably involved in the 118 anaerobic oxidation of methane (Fig. 4) . ANME-1 sequences were detected in layers 119 20 to 40 cmbsf where methane concentrations were concave up, and below where 120 sulfate removal was rapid, both typical of an AOM zone and consistent with the 121 authigenic carbonate formation. 122 DGGE fingerprinting and mcrA clone library analysis showed that ANME-1 were 123 present at all depths, except for the 80-100 cmbsf whereas the same analysis 124 highlighted that ANME-2a were present from 40 to 120 cmbsf, with the same 125 exception at 80-100 cmbsf. The ANME-2a subgroup was previously mostly detected 126 in cold seep environment dominated by low fluid fluxes (Mills et al., 2003; Inagaki et 127 al., 2004; Mills et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2006; Niemann et al., 2006) , and also in 128 hypersaline sediments in the Chefren mud volcano in the Nile Deep-Sea Fan 129 (Omoregie et al., 2008) . 130 F o r P e e r R e v i e w O n l y Also, members of the ANME-1 group have been detected in other environments with 137 high salinities such as a hydrothermal (45 °C) mud vent habitat underneath the deep-138 sea brine lake Urania in the Eastern Mediterranean (Yakimov et al., 2007a) , the brine 139 lake of the l'Atalante Basin (Yakimov et al., 2007b) , and an Arctic hypersaline 140 perennial spring (Niederberger et al., 2010) . 141 Given the very high chloride concentrations in the Napoli sediment sections from 142 which the clone libraries were constructed (i.e. 3000 mM at 40 cmbsf, and 4900 mM 143 at 120 cmbsf) it is possible that the Napoli mcrA a/b sequences belong to the ANME-144 1 subcluster adapted to high salinity habitats. In the hypersaline sediments of a mud 145 volcano in the Gulf of Mexico, there was no evidence for AOM, even though high 146 methane fluxes were detected (Joye et al. 2009 ). In contrast, in the Napoli mud 147 volcano sediments there was indirect evidence of AOM occuring in hypersaline 148 sediments, where methane was also present. 149  Methanogenic activity using methylamine was the only significant pathway 152 (Supplementary Material. SM2) in the shallow sediment layers (0 to 40 cmbsf) where 153 sulfate concentrations were maximum and chloride concentrations were at the lowest 154 values. Methylamine methanogenesis turnover rates were more than 10 2 times 155 higher than those for methanol methanogenesis in these same layers. Methanol 156 methanogenesis turnover rates were generally very low but a peak of activity occured 157 at about 50 cm and in the methane-rich layers, and again at 90 cmbsf. Methane 158 production was detected from the same depth interval in non hypersaline media 159 designed to enrich methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 160 (trimethylamine [TMA] and H 2 /CO 2 ). Total DNA was extracted from 10 -1 and 10 -2 161 dilution series of the TMA enriched medium inoculated with the 0-20 cmbsf sediment 162 section that produced methane. Phylogenetic affiliation of the 16S rRNA gene 163 sequences NapK-0_20-enr35, and NapK-0_20-enr36 showed 99% sequence 164 similarity with clone Tommo05_1274_3_Arch90 of the Euryarchaeota (FM179838 Culture-dependent and -independent methods were successful in identifying 177 Methanococcoides related methanogens from 0 to 120 cmbsf. These methanogens 178 are obligate methylotrophs using only methanol and methylamines as substrates 179 (Garcia et al., 2000) . The Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) outcompete methanogens 180 for substrates such as H 2 and acetate in sediments dominated by sulfate-reducing 181 process (Holmer et al., 1994) . However, SRB do not compete for methylated 182 substrates that are known to be mostly present in near sediment surfaces (Cetecioglu 183 et al., 2009 ). Then methylotrophic methanogens are able to outcompete SRB in 184 sulfate-rich marine sediments (Purdy et al., 2003; Dhillon et al., 2005; Roussel et al., 185 2009 ). Oremland et al. (1982 reported that methanol and trimethylamines were 186 important substrates for methanogens in salt marsh sediments, dominance of 187 Methanoccoides-type methanogens in sediments of Skan Bay (Kendall et al., 2007) 188 and in sediments of mangroves (Lyimo et al., 2000; Lyimo et al., 2009) were 189 previously reported. Methylamines were also shown to be the main methanogenic 190 catabolic substrate in the hypersaline brine of l'Atalante basin (McGenity, 2010) . Pure 191 cutures of methylotrophic methanogens of the Methanohalophilus genus using non 192 competitive substrates such as methylated amines or methanol show higher 193 tolerances to high salinity, up to 24 to 25% NaCl (Oren, 1999) . Methylotrophic 194 methanogens yields more free-energy (-191 .1 kJ/mol of trimethylamine) than 195 acetoclastic (-31.1 kJ/mol of acetate) or hydrogenotroph (-131 kJ/mol of hydrogen) 196 probably allowing methylotrophic methanogens to maintain an osmotically balanced 197 and functional cytoplasm in hypersaline environments (Oren, 1999) . Also, various 198 organic osmotic compounds were detected in halophilic methanogens such as 199 glycine betaine, glutamine, β-glutamate or N ε -acetyl β-lysine (Oren, 1999 (Singh et al., 2005) . M. alaskense was also 206 detected in a cold perennial spring of the Canadian high Arctic (Perreault et al., 207 2007 ). However, a second peak (0.25 pmol cm -3 day -1 ) of 220 activity occured at 125 cmbsf. This similar depth distribution of hydrogenotrophic and 221 acetoclastic methanogenesis was previously reported in two brines from the northern 222 Gulf of Mexico continental slope (Joye et al., 2009 ). Acetate methanogenesis rates in 223 the Napoli mud volcano were in agreement with those measured in sediments of the 224 Nankai Trough (maximum rate 0.11 pmol cm -3 day -1 ) (Newberry et al., 2004) . 225 Interestingly, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rates were below activity rates 226 measured in other marine sediments (Newberry et al., 2004; Parkes et al., 2007) . 227 The presence of methanogenesis activities from hexadecane, a long chain alkane 228 (Supplementary Material. SM2) around ~80 cmbsf demonstrated that methane 229 production from satured hydrocarbons might be significant as previously shown in 230 stable anaerobic enrichments (Zengler et al., 1999) . Interestingly, maximum turnover 231 of hexadecane to methane occured at a similar depth to peaks in both 232 hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogenis rates. A syntrophic association 233 involving methanogens and bacteria to degrade hexadecane to methane most likely 234 would be involved (Dolfing et al., 2008) , with acetogenic bacteria decomposing 235 hexadecanes to acetate and H 2 , which are in turn are available for acetoclastic and 236 hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Grabowski et al. (2005) observed in a low process. Acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were surmised to be 240 involved in the final step of hydrocarbon degradation in a petroleum hydrocarbon-241 contaminated aquifer (Kleikemper et al., 2005) . Also, Lloyd et al. (2006) detected 242 sequences possibly related to methanogens in the petroleum-rich and hypersaline 243 methane seep sediments of the Gulf of Mexico. Schulz et al. (1997) showed that the 244 sediments mobilized in the Napoli mud volcano were characterized by gaseous 245 hydrocarbons, and that the sediments comprising the mud breccia originated from 246 4900 to 7500 mbsf. Hence, the Napoli mud volcano probably displays a wide range 247 of substrates producing methane, including deep sourced petroleum. 248 Overall, PCR-DGGE and mcrA gene analysis demonstrated the presence of ANME-249 1, 2 and 3 clusters in sediments where hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic 250 methanogenesis rates were measured, suggesting that AOM is probably also present 251 and active. CO 2 produced by anaerobic methane oxidation mediated by ANME, plus 252 AOM metabolic intermediates could be available for the hydrogenotrophic 253 methanogenesis thus enhancing methane production (Parkes et al., 2007) . Sulfate-254 reducing bacteria can be inhibited by high salinities (Brandt et al. 2001) , which may 255 enable methanogens to occur even in the presence of high sulfate concentrations, as 256 in the Napoli mud volcano sediments. 257 Below 100 cmbsf, acetoclastic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway for 258 methane production. Hence, a shift from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic 259 methanogenesis occured. Bicarbonate can also be converted to acetate by 260 acetogens (Zepp Falz et al., 1999) . Acetogens were found to be important 261 competitors of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in a low-sulfate hypersaline microbial 262 mat collected from salterns in Baja (Kelley et al., 2006) . Also, halophilic 263 homoacetogens were reported in cyanobacterial mats, capable of producing acetate 264 from betaine, or bicarbonate (Zhilina et al., 1990) . Even though the acetogenic 265 reaction yields less energy than the actoclastic reaction, the halophilic 266 homoacetogens of the order Haloanaerobiales have been shown to use an 267 enegertically more efficient option to adapt to high salinity environments (Oren et al., 8 cm -3 and 11% respectively), compared to the total prokaryotic 281 depth distribution (Parkes et al., 2000) . Microbial abundance strongly decreased with 282 depth, reaching 5.5 x 10 6 cm -3 at 150 cmbsf. Only a limited number of prokaryotes 283 can cope with the hypersaline conditions of the Napoli mud volcano sediments which 284 explains the decrease in prokaryotic cell numbers with depth. However, within the 285 upper overlap between sulfate and methane (~20 to 60 cmbsf, Fig. 2 ), there is a clear 286 increase in total cell numbers above this decreasing trend (Fig. 5) , which suggests 287 active AOM (Parkes et al., 2005) and is consistent with the presence of ANME-1 288 sequences (Table 1) . 289 Although microbial abundance generally decreased with increasing chloride 290 concentrations, methanogenic activities in the centre of Napoli mud volcano (Charlou 291 et al., 2003) were comparable to those measured in subsurface sediments (Webster 292 et al., 2008) , but lower than rates of methanogenesis in Mediterranean brines and 293 Gulf of Mexico (Joye et al., 1999; van der Wielen et al., 2005; Daffonchio et al., 294 2006 ). This could be linked to the ascending fluid flows in the center of the mud 295 volcano, that could hinder efficient methanogenesis. Three factors are known to 296 influence methanogenic pathways: salinity, temperature and availability of substrates 297 (Zepp Falz et al., 1999; Glissmann et al., 2004; McGenity, 2010) . Salinity is a major 298 factor in determining microbial community structure, and hypersaline sediments can 299 be phylogenetically more diverse than other environments (Lozupone et al., 2007) . 300 However, saline gradients are composed of a number of electron acceptors, donors, 301 nutrients, and carbon sources available for the microorganisms (McGenity, 2010) . In 302 addition, salinity may indirectly control substrate availablity for methanogens, by 303 controling the diversity of organisms producing their substrates (i.e., halophilic because acetoclastic methanogens cannot tolerate these extrême halophilic 307 conditions (>60 ‰ salinity) (Oren, 1999) . However, acetoclastic methanogenesis 308 does occur in Napoli sediments, and at depths where chloride concentrations are 309 higher than 4 M (>140 ‰). Acetoclastic methanogenesis at a salinity exceeding 60‰ 310 has already been reported in brine sediments of a mud volcano in the Gulf of Mexico 311 (Joye et al., 2009) , demonstrating that some acetoclastic methanogens have adapted 312 to high salinity environments. In contrast, uncutivated archaeal sequences affiliated 313 with the MBG-D have been detected in many saline and hypersaline environments 314 (Benlloch et al., 2002; Sorensen et al., 2005; Lloyd et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2008; 315 Omoregie et al., 2008) . Jiang et al. (2008) propose that high salinity and alkalinity, 316 among other unknown factors, could play an important role in controlling the 317 distribution of marine benthic groups, such as the MBG-D. Hence the hypersaline 318 regime in the Napoli center sediments could have influenced establishment of these 319 Studies conducted on lake sediments show that a shift from 4 to 20°C induces a shift 321 from acetoclastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Zepp Falz et al., 1999; 322 Glissmann et al., 2004) . Indeed Schulz et al. (1997) hypothesize that in lake 323 sediments at low temperatures, hydrogenotrophic methanogens are limited by the 324 lack of supply of H 2 , which is linked with the idea that H 2 -producing syntrophs are 325 sensitive to low temperatures. In the Napoli sediments, the temperature at 70 cmbsf 326 was around 14 °C which could be one factor explaining why overall hydrogenotrophic 327 methanogenesis is higher than acetoclastic methanogenesis. In this context, Napoli 328 sediments are similar to other marine sediments as these are also dominated by 329 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Whiticar et al., 1986) . 330 Therefore, the brine affected Napoli mud volcano in the Mediterranean Sea 331 represents a dynamic ecological niche for methanogens and other prokaryotes that 332 have to adapt to variations in fluid flow and composition, and high salinity. 333  Site description and sediment sampling. 336 Sediment cores were collected from the center of the Napoli mud volcano at 1940 337 metres of water depth (Fig. 1) Two gravity cores KUL-3 (33°43.497'N, 24°41.1648'E) and 340 24°41.1549'E), 160 cm and 120 cm in length, respectively, were obtained. 341 Temperature gradients were measured using sensors attached to the gravity cores. 342 Immediately after retrieval, the KUL-3 and KUL-4 cores were sectioned aseptically in 343 20-cm-thick layers in a cold room (4°C), and mini-cores of sediment were removed 344 for gas and molecular analysis. Samples for molecular analysis were collected by 345 using cut-off sterile 5 mL syringes in the 20 cm sediment sections of KUL-4 and were 346 frozen at -80°C for nucleic acid extractions. For the KUL-3 core, 20 cm sections were 347 flushed with nitrogen, hermetically sealed in aluminium bag-rolls (Grüber-Folien, 348 Germany), and transported to the laboratory at 4°C for subsequent methanogenesis 349 rate measurements and pore water analysis. Methane concentrations were determined from 3 cm 3 sediment sample sealed in 369 glass tubes containing 6 mL NaOH (2.5% w/v), on board using the headspace 370 technique coupled with a gas chromatograph GC (HSS-GC) equipped with a thermal-371 conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame-ionisation detector (error of 4%). Helium was 372 the carrier gas, and column temperature was 40 °C (details in Sarradin et al., 1996) . Genes coding for the alpha subunit of the methyl-coenzyme M-reductase's (mcrA) 481 were amplified using the ME1 (5'-GCMATGCARATHGGWATGTC-3') and ME2 (5'-482 TCATKGCRTAGTTDGGRTAGT-3') primers (Hales et al., 1996) http://wdcm.nig.ac.jp/RDP/html/analyses.html). Potential chimeras were eliminated 502 before phylogenetic trees were constructed. The mcrA sequences were then edited 503 in the BioEdit v7.0.5 program (Hall, 1999) , translated into amino acid sequences, and 504 aligned using ClustalX (Larkin et al., 2007) . Sequence data was analysed with the 505 F o r P e e r R e v i e w O n l y Rarefaction curves were calculated for each mcrA clone library using the RarFac 509 program (http://www.icbm.de/pmbio/), and we used a 97% similarity level to define 510 the groups of sequences. Libraries' coverage was calculated using the following 511 formula: C=[1-(n 1 /N)]*100, where n 1 is the number of unique OTUs, and N is number 512 of clones in the library (Singleton et al., 2001) . 513 Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. 515 The sequence data reported here will appear in GenBank nucleotide sequence 516 databases under the accession no.

4430700,Novel microbial communities of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano and their role as a methane sink,"Submarine mud volcanoes may be major players in the emission of the greenhouse gas methane. A select group of microorganisms, called methanotrophs, can consume this gas, but their impact on methane emission in this environment is not well understood. A study of the waters around a mud volcano in the Barents Sea has identified three key methanotrophic communities: aerobic bacteria, anaerobic archaea living beneath tubeworms, and previously undescribed archaea associated with bacterial mats. A natural cap on the capacity of the microbial methane filter was also discovered: the upward flow of sulphate- and oxygen-free volcanic fluids restricts the efficiency of methane oxidation, allowing much of the methane to escape to the hydrosphere and potentially the atmosphere.","Mud volcanism is an important natural source of the greenhouse gas methane to the hydrosphere and atmosphere 1, 2 . Recent investigations show that the number of active submarine mud volcanoes might be much higher than anticipated (for example, see refs [3] [4] [5] , and that gas emitted from deep-sea seeps might reach the upper mixed ocean [6] [7] [8] . Unfortunately, global methane emission from active submarine mud volcanoes cannot be quantified because their number and gas release are unknown 9 . It is also unclear how efficiently methane-oxidizing microorganisms remove methane. Here we investigate the methane-emitting Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV, Barents Sea, 726 N, 146 449 E; 1,250 m water depth) to provide quantitative estimates of the in situ composition, distribution and activity of methanotrophs in relation to gas emission. The HMMV hosts three key communities: aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Methylococcales), anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2) thriving below siboglinid tubeworms, and a previously undescribed clade of archaea (ANME-3) associated with bacterial mats. We found that the upward flow of sulphate-and oxygen-free mud volcano fluids restricts the availability of these electron acceptors for methane oxidation, and hence the habitat range of methanotrophs. This mechanism limits the capacity of the microbial methane filter at active marine mud volcanoes to ,40% of the total flux. The HMMV (Fig. 1 ), a circular structure of 1 km diameter and ,10 m elevation above the adjacent sea floor, has been studied since the 1990s as a typical example of an active mud volcano 9 . Its formation might have coincided with a submarine landslide during the late Pleistocene, 330,000-200,000 years ago 10 . Today, fluids, gas and muds rise from a depth of 2-3 km through a conduit below the HMMV 10, 11 . The emitted gas is of a mixed microbial/thermogenic origin and consists of .99% CH 4 with a d 13 C-isotope signature of -60% (refs 12, 13) . The rising fluids are depleted in sulphate, chloride and magnesium as a result of subsurface clay dewatering 11 . Investigation of the HMMV with RV Polarstern and ROV Victor 6000 in 2003 showed extensive outcroppings of fresh subsurface muds associated with steep thermal gradients 14 , gas and fluid vents, and a large gas plume reaching the mixed upper water column above the HMMV 8, 12 . Seafloor videography in combination with geochemical measurements provided in situ estimates of gas flux 8 , fluid flow 15 and habitat distribution 16 . We focused on the three main concentric habitats above the gassy muds ( Fig. 2) : the centre of the HMMV, which was devoid of visible epifauna; thiotrophic bacterial mats dominated by a Beggiatoa species; and surrounding fields of siboglinid tubeworms. The concentrations of gases in sediments and bottom water were elevated in all three habitats (Table 1 ). An essential difference between the habitats is the fluid flow modelled from in situ gradients of temperature, oxygen and sulphide concentrations 15 . The results indicate that the upward transport of oxidant-depleted mud volcano fluids hinders downward diffusion of oxygen and sulphate, and limits methanotrophic habitats in the centre and below bacterial mats to the uppermost millimetres to centimetres, respectively 15 . We have now identified and quantified the methanotrophs that populate the three habitats to assess their role in controlling methane flux at the HMMV (Table 1;  The surface of the most recent mud flows in the centre of the HMMV, characterized by steep temperature gradients of 3uC m -1 (ref. 14) , hosted high numbers of microbes, reaching 3.6 (62.1; 6s.d.) 3 10 9 cells cm -3 , of which 56% (68%) belonged to type I aerobic methanotrophic bacteria of the orders Methylococcales and Methylophaga (Figs 2b, 3c ). The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of the dominant Methylococcales types (HMMV-MetI and -MetII) are closely related to sequences of methanotrophic mussel symbionts (94-97%) 17 and to clone sequence Hyd24-1 (96-99%) from gashydrate-bearing sediments of Hydrate Ridge 18 . High concentrations of a 13 C-depleted (-80%), type I methanotroph-specific fatty acid (C16:1v8c) were found in the same samples ( Fig. 3d ). As predicted by the fluid flow model for this area 15 , methanotroph cell numbers, lipid biomarkers and rates of aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) peaked in the uppermost surface sediment and decreased more than fivefold in the second centimetre because of limited oxygen penetration ( Fig. 3a-d ). Only small amounts of methanotroph lipids (,0.1 mg per gram sediment dry weight; mg g-dw 21 ) and very low numbers of cells (,10 7 cells cm -3 ) were found below a sediment depth of 5 cm ( Fig. 3c, d ). ANME cells were not microscopically detectable in the centre cores using all known ANME oligonucleotide probes, and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) was not detectable. In situ microsensor profiles of sulphide concentrations in HMMV sediments indicated that AOM occurs in older mud flows, 2-3 cm below the sulphide-oxidizer mats (Figs 2c, 3f ). Accordingly, microbial biomass peaked in the top 3 cm ( Fig. 3g ) and mainly consisted of a previously undescribed consortium of archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) forming dense cell aggregates ( Fig. 2c ). 16S rRNA gene analyses of DNA revealed a dominant cluster of archaeal sequences forming a new phylogenetic group named ANME-3 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Single sequences of this cluster were only sporadically detected at cold seeps 19, 20 , which are typically dominated by other phylogenetic clades of anaerobic methanotrophs (that is, ANME-1 and ANME-2 with their bacterial partners, sulphate reducers of the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) branch) [19] [20] [21] . We propose that members of the ANME-3 cluster are also capable of AOM, for three reasons: the AOM maximum coincides with the sulphide production zone; there are high numbers of ANME-3 aggregates (19.7 (60.6) 3 10 6 aggregates cm -3 at 1-2 cm sediment depth), making up 80% of total cell numbers; and concentrations of the lipid biomarkers sn2-hydroxyarchaeol, archaeol and specific penta-methylicosenes are highly elevated ( Fig. 3e-h) . Moreover, the archaeal lipid biomarkers have stable C-isotope signatures (d 13 C-values ,-98%), indicating that methane is the main carbon source of ANME-3 cells. Analyses of 16S rRNA genes and lipid biomarkers showed that the bacterial partner associated with ANME-3 is different from all other ANME consortia (see Supplementary Information) . It is closely related to Desulfobulbus spp. (DBB) and also takes up methanederived carbon, as indicated by its specific lipid biomarker C17:1v6c with a d 13 C-value of -70% ( Fig. 3h ). As predicted by the fluid flow model, 95% of ANME-3/DBB aggregates were found directly below the Beggiatoa mats ( Fig. 3g ). Because of reduced fluid flow velocities, sulphate can penetrate the upper 4-6 cm of the sediment column ( Fig. 3f , Table 1 ). Furthermore, the re-oxidation of sulphide by the sulphide oxidizer mats replenishes the sulphate pool in these sediments, further contributing to the maintenance of high activity and biomass of the AOM community in this zone. The next significant transition in HMMV habitats occurs about 300-400 m from its geographical centre, where the sulphide oxidizer mats are replaced by dense tubeworm colonies on the hummocky periphery of the HMMV (Fig. 2d , Table 1 ). Two siboglinid tubeworm species, Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis and Sclerolinum contortum 13 , populate this area with biomasses of 1-2 kg wet weight m -2 (estimated from sieved boxcore samples). Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis, the dominant species in the investigated area, is up to 60 cm long and has a diameter of 0.5 mm. In the tubeworm fields, fluid flow rates modelled from temperature profiles (0.4 m yr -1 ) were lower than those in the centre or bacterial mat area 14 . In agreement with the low subsurface temperature gradient in this zone 14 (Fig. 3e , i), gravity cores from this area contained gas hydrate below the worm-infested sediment layers. Balancing downward diffusion and upward fluid flow, maximum sulphate penetration could reach 12 cm. However, the measured oxygen and sulphate penetration in the tubeworm field (Figs 2d, 3i, j; Table 1 ) show that the tubeworms substantially increase the transport of electron acceptors into deeper sediment layers. Accordingly, the maximum AOM was found between the base of the worm tubes and the hydrate layer (60-90 cm below sea floor (b.s.f.)), coinciding with a subsurface peak of ANME-2/DSS aggregates (5.5 3 10 6 aggregates cm -3 ) and their specific biomarker lipids ( Fig. 3i -l). Integrated ex situ methane consumption was higher than in other zones of the HMMV (Table 1) . Microbe-invertebrate symbioses have an advantage over free-living microbial populations because they can engineer their environment to increase access to both electron donors and acceptors by special migratory behaviour, mining and pumping. An interesting question remains: which factors determine the transition between Beggiatoa mats and tubeworm fields, and the temporal succession of the thio-and methanotrophic communities? Visual observation of the sea floor showed that sulphide-oxidizing mats and tubeworm colonies are mutually exclusive (no worms were found within bacterial mats). Tubeworm larvae probably cannot settle on Beggiatoa mats owing to the high fluid flow and high AOM-based sulphide concentration in this habitat. However, compared with filamentous sulphide oxidizers, tubeworms can reach much deeper zones of sulphide production, and might efficiently compete for sulphide and methane uptake. In conclusion, we found that methane oxidation was the main energy source for microbial biomass in all habitats of the HMMV. Populations of aerobic or anaerobic methanotrophs comprised 56-76% of the total microbial community (centre and Beggiatoa mat habitats). At their maxima in abundance and activity ( Fig. 3) , methanotrophic communities show relatively low 22 cell-specific rates of methane oxidation (around 0.1 fmol CH 4 per cell per day, under atmospheric pressure), possibly owing to the low ambient temperature of -1 uC. The total integrated activity and biomass was lower for the aerobic methanotrophs than for the AOM communities, as the former were limited to the surface of the centre muds by high fluid flow (Table 1 , and see Supplementary Information). ANME-3 and ANME-2 consortia both dominate areas with lower flow, and profit from the association with other organisms that re-oxidize sulphide to sulphate. Total methane consumption in the centre, Beggiatoa and tubeworm habitats was up to 0.2, 1.8 and 3.0 3 10 6 mol yr -1 , respectively (sum 5.0 3 10 6 mol yr -1 ). In 2003, methane emission to the hydrosphere from the HMMV reached 8-35 3 10 6 mol yr -1 (ref. 8) , resulting in a total methane flux of 13-40 3 10 6 mol yr -1 . Aerobic oxidation of methane had a minor role (1-3%) compared with anaerobic oxidation, which removed up to 37% of the total methane flux. Hence, the efficiency of microbial methane removal is substantially lower than in other methanefuelled systems [23] [24] [25] . These data confirm that fluid advection acts as a main habitat-structuring factor at cold seep ecosystems, by regulating the availability of electron acceptors and hence the distribution and activity of methanotrophs. It is generally assumed that with increasing upward flow velocities, more dissolved methane is transported to the surface, fuelling increasingly active seep communities (for example, see ref. 26 ). However, geofluids produced from compaction processes and dewatering are depleted in electron acceptors. High flows of methane-laden fluids introduce a negative switch in the relationship between fluid flow and methanotroph activity. Furthermore, if such fluids transport heat from below, they could even suppress the formation of hydrates, which represent an important-although dynamic-sink for methane on earth 27 . Consequently, as in the case of the HMMV, methane rising with warm, oxidant-depleted fluids might accumulate in muds and escape as free gas to the hydrosphere. Here we have shown that the efficiency of the microbial filter against methane decreases considerably at fluid flow rates .0.4 m yr -1 , causing increased efflux of methane to the hydrosphere and probably even to the atmosphere 8 . Velocities of decimetres to metres per year are within the average range of fluid flow measured at cold seeps 28, 29 , so the described inhibition of microbial methane consumption might be widespread at seeps. Further quantitative in situ measurements of fluid flow and microbial methane consumption are necessary to define the relevance and control of methane emissions from submarine mud volcanoes and other fluid-flow driven geo-bio-systems. Sampling. Our studies took place during two cruises with RV L'Atalante (2001) and RV Polarstern (2003), both equipped with ROV VICTOR 6000. Sediments were collected with ROV pushcores and gravity cores for on board (ex situ) measurements. Sediment cores as well as in situ microsensor profiles were obtained along a radial transect from the centre to the east of the mud volcano (Fig. 1b) . Bottom water was sampled with a bottom water sampler and methane concentrations were determined by gas chromatography 8 . A detailed description of the methods described here is provided in the Supplementary Information. Sulphate reduction and methane oxidation rates. Microbial rates of aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation (MOx and AOM, respectively) and sulphate reduction (SR) in sediments were determined ex situ using 14 Lipid analysis. Lipid biomarkers from frozen sediment samples and tubeworm tissue were extracted, separated and derivatized as described previously 22, 30 . Single lipid compounds were analysed by gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine their quantity, identity and stable carbon isotope ratio, respectively 30 . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Cells of Methylococcales as well as ANME-3/DBB and ANME-2/DSS aggregates were quantified by FISH with monolabelled oligonucleotide probes as previously described 20 . Sulphate and chloride concentrations. Sulphate concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis from the supernatant of 5 ml sediment fixed with 25 ml zinc acetate solution 25 . Chloride concentrations were determined from pressure-filtered pore water by ion chromatography. Microsensor measurements. Microsensors (20 mm tip diameter) for O 2 , H 2 S and pH were manufactured and used as described previously 15 . Profiles were recorded in situ with a spatial resolution of 0.025 cm by deploying a profiler unit (equipped with the sensors) with the ROV or a free falling lander system. A detailed description of in situ data and the geochemical models applied here is provided elsewhere 15 . Profiles of oxygen, sulphide and temperature (a, e, i); sulphate, ex situ methane and sulphate turnover (b, f, j), bacteria and aggregate counts (c, g, k), and selected lipid biomarkers (d, h, l) from the centre (a-d), Beggiatoa-covered sediments (e-h), and the tubeworm field (i-l). Oxygen, sulphide and temperature were measured in situ with microsensors mounted on a deep-sea profiling unit. AOM, SR, sulphate, cell and aggregate counts, and lipid biomarker contents, were determined using ROV pushcorer samples from the same sites. The errors of MOx and AOM measurements (Fig. 3b , f, j) are given as s.e.m.",Helge Niemann,2006,17051217,10.1038/nature05227
214827724,Atribacteria from the Subseafloor Sedimentary Biosphere Disperse to the Hydrosphere through Submarine Mud Volcanoes,N/A,"The subseafloor environment is one of the largest biospheres on Earth, with an estimated total abundance of microorganisms of about 2.9 × 10 29 cells, which is equivalent to half of the microbial cells worldwide in the oceans . Over the past decade, subseafloor life and the deep biosphere have been intensively explored by means of scientific ocean drilling, which has assessed the biosphere extent down to around 2.5 km below the ocean floor (Orcutt et al., 2013; Ciobanu et al., 2014; Inagaki et al., 2015) . Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that some subseafloor microbial cells are not dead but rather are physiologically active or revivable to some degree, and their long-term metabolic activity may contribute to global biogeochemical cycles (Morono et al., 2011; Røy et al., 2012; Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013) . The taxonomic composition of microbial communities in subseafloor sedimentary habitats has been extensively studied using a variety of cultivation-dependent and -independent molecular approaches, demonstrating that some predominant microbial taxa, distinct from known water-column communities, widely inhabit sediments at a variety of oceanic locations under similar geochemical and geophysical settings (e.g., Inagaki et al., 2003 Inagaki et al., , 2006 Webster et al., 2004; Biddle et al., 2008) . One of the common predominant microbial taxa frequently found in the marine sediment is Atribacteria including members of JS1 and OP9 which are recently revealed to be monophyletic by phylogenomic analyses of single-cell amplified genome (Nobu et al., 2016) . Atribacteria are especially predominant in anaerobic, organic carbon replete, and methane-rich marine sediment. Although representatives of this phylum have not been cultivated as yet, several recent studies of single-cell amplified genomes consistently suggested anaerobic heterotrophic metabolism (Carr et al., 2015; Nobu et al., 2016) . Although the co-occurrence of Atribacteira with methane (Inagaki et al., 2006) , no evidence has been reported that this phylum was directly involved in methane production or consumption. Alternatively, Atribacteira would control methane production in anaerobic marine sediment by primary or secondary fermentation producing fermentation products as acetate or CO 2 , that can be used as substrates for methanogen (Carr et al., 2015; Nobu et al., 2016) . Among diverse geological and oceanographic settings in the ocean, numerous submarine mud volcanoes (SMVs) have been observed worldwide along the margins of convergent plates, which transport mud, gasses and fluids from several kilometers below the seafloor to the overlying hydrosphere (Milkov, 2000; Kopf, 2002 and references therein) . SMVs accordingly serve as conduits for the release of substantial amounts of methane and other hydrocarbons into the water column (Sauter et al., 2006; Wallmann et al., 2006; Sahling et al., 2009) , and hence act as natural pipelines in the geosphere. Over the past decades, the microbial communities inhabiting hydrocarbon seeps associated with SMVs have been investigated around the world, including at the Håkon Mosby (Niemann et al., 2006; Jerosch et al., 2007; Losekann et al., 2007) , Kazan (Kormas et al., 2008; Pachiadaki et al., 2010) , Amsterdam (Pachiadaki et al., 2011) , Chefren (Omoregie et al., 2008) , and Gulf of Mexico mud volcanoes (Martinez et al., 2006) and at the Nankai Trough (Miyazaki et al., 2009) . The studies at SMVs mainly focused on the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) consortia of sulfate-reducing bacteria and methane-oxidizing archaea living in sediments at the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). Considering that SMVs transport not only solid materials (e.g., muds and breccias) but also gasses and fluids from deep sources (Sauter et al., 2006; Feseker et al., 2008) , it is possible that submarine mud volcanism may also transport microbial communities from the deep subseafloor biosphere to the overlying ocean. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents on the ridge systems have been proposed as ""windows to a subsurface biosphere"" (Deming and Baross, 1993) , and there have been some investigations into the dispersal of subseafloor microbial communities, including mesophilic to hyperthermophilic microbes, through volcanic and hydrothermal vent activity (e.g., Huber et al., 2003 Huber et al., , 2006 Takai et al., 2004; Jungbluth et al., 2016) . In the hydrothermal systems, however, only surface of vents are habitable zone for microbes due to the very steep temperature gradient up to higher than 300 • C. Therefore, deep-sea hydrothermal vents would not be considered as conduits of deep biosphare and hence the geosphere-biosphere interactions at sedimentary geosystems (e.g., oceanic plate subduction zones, forearc sedimentary basins) as well as interactions between the Earth's surface and deep subseafloor biospheres in the large oceanic province remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated microbial communities inhabiting two SMVs off Tanegashima Island, Japan (Ujiie, 2000) , by taking sediment cores from the summit (down to a sediment depth of 3.6 m) and samples of overlying seawater (up to 200-300 m above the summit). Sediment core samples were collected in 2015 using a Navigable Sampling System (see Ashi et al., 2014) , which enables pinpoint piston coring with televisionmonitoring of the seafloor. The concentrations of methane in the water column peaked at 19 and 72 m above the two SMVs, respectively, indicating the presence of a methane plume from the SMV. To identify and quantify members of the microbial communities in mud volcano sediment and seawater samples, we applied molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes using a second generation sequencer, image-based cell counts, catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), and microfluidic digital PCR techniques.  Previous acoustic seafloor surveys identified several 10s of SMVs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean at water depths of 1200-3500 m off Tanegashima Island, Japan. For one of these, geochemical information, including stable isotopic compositions of methane and water (i.e., interstitial water in sediment) is available (Nakayama et al., 2010) , whereas there are as yet no microbiological studies. In 2015, we investigated the distribution and diversity of microbial communities inhabiting two of the SMVs in this area: MV#1 and MV#14 (Figure 1 ). MV#1 has a diameter of about 3000 m, a height of 300 m, and is situated  Sediment and seawater samples were obtained at two stations, VTF2 (MV#1) and VTF5 (MV#14), during cruise KH-15-2 of R/V Hakuho Maru in 2015. Sediment samples were collected using the Navigable Sampling System (Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo). At each station, hydrographic parameters were recorded with a CTD-carousel system (SBE 9, Sea-Bird Scientific, Bellevue, WA, United States), which was deployed with simultaneous water sampling using Niskin bottles (General Oceanics, Inc., Miami, FL, United States). For comparison in the DNA analysis, we used stratified sediment core samples from the Peru Margin, Juan de Fuca ridge flank, and offshore of the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan, which were collected during Ocean Drilling Program ( Table 1) . For DNA extraction, all SMV sediments and the stratified sediments were frozen immediately after sampling and stored at −80 • C until use. For cell count of the SMVs sediment, 2 g of sediment was collected by using a tip-cut syringe and transferred to a 15-ml falcon tube. Subsequently, 8 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde was added to the sediment for fixation. After overnight fixation at 4 • C, the fixed sediment was washed twice with PBS buffer and stored in 50% PBS/ethanol at −20 • C. After core recovery, wet sediment was immediately sampled at 20-to 50-cm intervals and pore water samples were extracted onboard with a stainless-steel squeezer (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) . The sulfate content of pore water was analyzed using an ion chromatograph (Dionex ICS-500) with an isocratic carbonate/bicarbonate eluent coupled with suppressed conductivity detection. Analytical precision was estimated to be within 0.4% from repeated measurements of the same samples. Sediment samples for the determination of methane concentrations were collected using tip-cut plastic syringes immediately after core recovery. The syringe end was tightly capped with a silicone-rubber stopper. The sediment sample was transferred from the syringe into a glass vial in a N 2 -flushed glove bag, and then the vial was capped with a Teflon-coated rubber septum and aluminum seal for subsequent geochemical analyses. The glass vials were frozen at −20 • C and stored until analysis. In a laboratory on shore, the glass vials were heated in an oven at 60 • C for 30 min. From the glass vials, 0.1-0.5 mL of the gas phase was extracted with a gas-tight syringe and introduced into a gas chromatograph-isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer (Tsunogai et al., 2002) . The methane content was calculated by comparing the 44 CO 2 output of the isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometer with those measured during analyses of a working-standard gas containing 5000 ppm methane in He. The standard deviation of repeated analysis of the laboratory standard gas was <4%. For quantification of methane in seawater, two replicate samples were collected from each Niskin bottle: two 120-ml serum vials were filled to overflowing after flushing with approximately two vial-volumes to avoid air contamination. The seawater samples were fixed by the addition of 500 µl saturated HgCl 2 solution to inhibit microbial activity during storage, sealed with gray butylrubber septa and aluminum crimp-caps, and then stored in the dark at 4 • C until analysis in the laboratory at the University of the Ryukyus (Okinawa, Japan). Dissolved methane was analyzed by purge-trap gas chromatography (GC) (GC-2014, Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector. Hydrocarbons were chromatographically separated on a Porapak Q packed column (80-100 mesh; 2-m length) operated at 40 • C using ultra-high-purity He as the carrier gas (Air Liquide, purity 99.9999%). The system was calibrated using a gas standard with a certified methane concentration (9.72 ppm) provided by Japan Fine Products (Kawasaki, Japan). The precision of the method was 10%, as estimated from the standard deviation of replicate analysis of water samples (n = 4). Cell concentrations in sediment samples were determined using a previously described procedure (Morono et al., 2013) . Briefly, after washing fixed sediment with a NaCl solution, a mixture of detergent and methanol was added and the sediment slurry was shaken for 60 min at 500 rpm using a Shake Master (Bio Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). The slurry was then sonicated and carefully layered onto a high-density cushion consisting of multiple density layers of Nycodenz and sodium polytungstate solutions. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was carefully transferred to a new vial. The detergent and methanol mixture was added to the remaining pellet, and the mixture was again sonicated and centrifuged with the high-density cushion solution. The supernatants were pooled and the combined recovered suspension was filtered onto a polycarbonate membrane. For seawater samples, 300 mL of formalin-fixed seawater was directly filtered onto a polycarbonate membrane. The number of microbial cells stained by SYBR Green I was determined either using an automated cell counting system with analysis of acquired images using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) (Morono and Inagaki, 2010) , or counted manually under fluorescence microscopy. DNA was extracted from 5 g wet sediment or 300 mL seawater using the PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to manufacturer's instructions. For the seawater samples, soon after recovery of the Niskin bottles 300 mL seawater was filtered using a disposable MicroFunnel 300 Filter Unit with 0.2-µm pore size (Pall Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and stored at −20 • C prior to extraction. For a negative control, 5 mL Milli-Q water (Millipore) was used for extraction in place of sediment or seawater. The extracted DNA solution (approximately 5 mL) from sediment was further concentrated by ethanol precipitation. To increase the DNA yield, 10 µL of linear acrylamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Kanagawa, Japan) was added before centrifugation. The DNA precipitate was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.0 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) and stored at −20 • C until use. The abundance 16S rRNA genes was quantified by microfluidic digital PCR (dPCR) using the BioMark Real-time System and 12.765 Digital Array (Fluidigm Corporation, South San Francisco, CA, United States) as described elsewhere (Hoshino and Inagaki, 2012) . For each sample, 6 µL of PCR mixture was prepared as follows: 3.0 µL of 2× MightyAmp buffer (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan), 0.15 µL of Binding Dye sample loading reagent (Fluidigm), 0.12 µL of MightyAmp DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio), 0.3 µL of EvaGreen (Biotum, Fremont, CA, United States), 0.015 µL of Rox dye, 0.15 µL each of forward and reverse primer, 1.0 µL of extracted DNA, and 1.115 µL of water. We used the domain-specific primers B27F-B357R and A806F-A958R (Table 2 ) for the amplification of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, respectively. The V3-V4 hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene, which is often used for analyzing microbial diversity and community structure, was amplified by PCR using universal primers U515F/U806R (Table 2 ). The 25-µl PCR mixture consists of 0.3 µM of each primer, 1 µl of the template DNA, 1× MightyAmp Buffer Ver.2, and 0.5 µl of MightyAmp DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio). The PCR started with 2 min at 98 • C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 • C for 10 s, annealing at 55 • C for 15 s, and elongation at 68 • C for 30 s. After purification of the desired PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, index and adapter were added to the purified product during the eight cycles of second-round PCR using KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready mix (Kapa Biosystems) with 250 pg of the purified PCR product as described elsewhere (Caporaso et al., 2012) . The indexed PCR products were purified twice by AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter), and then the PCR product was sequenced by the MiSeq platform with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3, 600 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). All the purified PCR products were sequenced in a sequencing run of Miseq and account for two fifth of total clusters. Raw sequences were demultiplexed, and the sequence quality was filtered using the BaseSpace app (Illumina). Further processing, including primer trimming, sequence length screening, taxonomic identification, clustering and diversity analysis, were performed using the 'mothur' software package (v. 1.35.0) (Schloss et al., 2009 ) and USEARCH 64-bit version 1 . After the screening, the average number of sequence reads per sample was 54,410 (Supplementary Table 2 ). The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) obtained were used for non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis using the 'vegan' package of R software as described elsewhere (Dixon, 2003; Doi and Okamura, 2011) for beta-diversity analysis of microbial communities. To exclude confounding results due to potential contaminants from the extraction process and chemicals used for PCR and sequencing, the top 10 families in the negative controls, and previously reported core-human microbiomes (Li et al., 2013) were arbitrary removed (listed in Supplementary Table 1 ). The removed top 10 families are generally consistent with laboratory and reagent contaminants in microbiome analyses (Salter et al., 2014) . We performed all the analyses in this study without removing those potential contaminant and confirmed that removal of those did not significantly affect the results (Supplementary Figures 1, 2 and Table 2 ). To detect and visualize atribacterial cells in microbial communities in the MVs, we designed a new oligonucleotide probe Atri578 (Table 2) , which can be used to detect a broad range of atribacterial sequences in the ARB Silva Database by using ARB software and mathFISH (Ludwig et al., 2004; Yilmaz et al., 2011) . The coverage of Atri578 to atribacterial sequences determined by TestProbe3.0 with the SILVA Database SSU128 is 70.6% and only two sequences in the outgroup are no-mismtach to Atri578. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled Atri578 probe was purchased from Biomers GmbH (Ulm, Germany). The optimal formamide concentration in hybridization buffer was determined by clone-FISH (Schramm et al., 2002) using a synthesized vector (Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan) containing the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of Atribacteria bacterium SCGC AAA255-N14 (ASPC01000002). We tested formamide concentrations of 0% to 60% at 10% intervals, at 35 • C and found 10% to be the optimal formamide concentration. Using this concentration, Atribacteria on the membrane filters were detected by CARD-FISH for the water column samples. The sediment samples from SMVs had very low cell number and the number of cells on the filter membrane after cell separation described above was not enough to detect Atribacteria. Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed according to a previously described protocol (Hoshino et al., 2008 (Hoshino et al., , 2015 . Briefly, hybridization was performed in hybridization buffer containing 10% formamide and 0.5 µM of the HRP-labeled Atri578 probe at 35 • C for 2 h. After washing away excess probe, the membrane filter was incubated with Alexa555-or Alexa488-labeled tyramide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 35 • C for 30 min for signal deposition, followed by counterstaining with SYBR Green I or DAPI. Sequence data obtained in this study have been submitted to the DDBJ database under accession numbers DRA005491 and DRA005492.  Sulfate concentrations in sediment pore water from both SMVs showed maxima around 25-30 mM in the uppermost sediment, with concentrations rapidly decreasing with depth (Figure 2) . In sediments deeper than 1 m below the seafloor (mbsf), sulfate was almost depleted at both SMVs. The concentration of methane was generally higher in pore water from MV#1 than MV#14, ranging from 0.5 to 13 mM and from 0.06 to 5.1 mM, respectively. Although measured concentrations varied widely probably because of depressurization of sediment, methane was depleted near the sediment surface at around 1 mbsf. The depth profiles of sulfate and methane indicate that the SMTZ was located at around 1 mbsf at both SMVs. In the overlying water column, the concentration of methane peaked to 0.71 nM at 29 m above MV#1 and to 1.93 nM at 70 m above MV#14. Those peaks indicate the occurrence of methane plume and thus advective flow from the SMVs because methane is immediately oxidized in water column and its concentration almost never reached to that high in normal water column at the similar depth (Toki et al., 2016) . Cell densities in seawater, based on counts of cells stained with SYBR Green I, were estimated to be in the range of 4.7 × 10 4 to 1.4 × 10 5 cells/ml at MV#1 and MV#14, respectively (Figure 3) . The gene abundance of 16S rRNA genes in seawater, as sum of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Figure 3) FIGURE 2 | Methane (red circles) and sulfate (blue circles) concentrations in sediment pore water at SMVs MV#1 (A) and MV#14 (B). FIGURE 3 | Microbial cell counts by SYBR Green I staining, and digital PCR (dPCR) quantification of 16S rRNA gene abundance. dPCR results are the sum of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance. dPCR results from reference sites from previous drilling expeditions are provided for comparison (see Table 1 for sampling site information). * Height above the summit of the SMVs. * * LSR, ""low statistical reliability"" because of very low, but detectable, cell numbers. quantified by microfluidic dPCR, were overall slightly lower than the cell densities. Cell counts and gene abundance from the seawater above the SMVs were relatively constant throughout the water column at 5 × 10 3 copies/ml and 6 × 10 4 cells/ml (Top panel of Figure 3 ) up to around 400 m above the summit, the upper limit of sample collection. The cell concentrations in the shallowest sediment samples from the seafloor were 2.4 × 10 2 and 1.3 × 10 5 cells/g-wet sediment for MV#1 and MV#14, respectively. Cell concentrations at the two SMVs dropped sharply to only 20 and 13 cells/g-wet sediment at 0.58 and 0.51 mbsf, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene abundance for MV#1 in the uppermost sediment sample was 3.3 × 10 3 copies/g-wet sediment, which is an order of magnitude higher than the cell concentration, whereas the cell counts in the uppermost sediment at MV#14 were higher than the 16S rRNA gene abundance (8.0 × 10 3 copies/g-wet sediment). The 16S rRNA gene abundance in sediment from depths greater than 1.5 mbsf were 10-100 times the cell concentrations. Throughout the sediment cores, MV#1 generally had lower 16S rRNA gene abundance than MV#14, and the gene abundance at MV#1 decreased to about 1 × 10 2 copies at 1.1 mbsf. At MV#14, the 16S rRNA gene abundance gradually decreased with increasing depth to 4.7 × 10 2 copies/g-wet sediment at 3.0 mbsf, the deepest sediment sampled. The estimated 16S rRNA gene abundance as well as cell concentrations in the deeper mud volcano sediments were markedly lower than those in shallow seafloor sediments and in other stratified subseafloor sediments on Pacific margins collected during previous IODP expeditions. In general, the abundance of 16S rRNA genes in the SMVs varied from 10 1 to 10 5 copies/g-wet sediment, which is two to seven orders of magnitude lower than in stratified sedimentary environments (Figure 3) . The cell counts are higher than the gene abundance in the water column in this study, whereas in the sediment the trend was opposite to the water column. The reasons of formar discrepancy can be partially explained by biases as low DNA extraction efficiency or false positive counts of fluorescence-emitting particles (Lloyd et al., 2013) . The latter might be caused by low recovery of cells from very sticky texture of the MV sediment. In any case, the results from both methods are consistent with the general trends; (1) Higher microbial abundance in the overlying seawater than mud volcano sediment: (2) Decrease of microbial abundance with sediment depth. We obtained around 1.6 million sequences in total by Miseq sequencing of SMV sediment and overlying seawater samples (Supplementary Table 2 ). Phylum-level classification showed the predominance of Proteobacteria in all seawater samples, comprising more than 50% in all sequence libraries (Figure 4) . The taxonomic composition of microbial communities in seawater was generally constant at both sites and at different depths. The second most representative phylum was Marinimicrobia (formerly SAR405), comprising 10-14% of the total community, followed by Thaumarchaeota comprising 5-15%. In contrast, the community composition of mud volcano sediments was markedly different from that in the water column, even at the phylum level; for example, Marinimicrobia was nearly absent in sediment samples. The MV community composition was also distinct from those of the reference stratified sediment (Supplementary Figure 4) . In addition, the community compositions at the two mud volcano sites were notably different: Proteobacteria was dominant at MV#1, comprising between 21 and 58% of the total, whereas Atribacteria FIGURE 4 | Microbial community composition in the sediment and overlying seawater at two SMVs using phylum-level classification. Only the top 20 phyla are shown. Numbers in parentheses show the water column depth (meters above the SMV summit) for water samples (labels that start with ""w"") and depth in sediment for sediment samples (labels that start with numbers). (formerly OP9 and JS1) comprised 21-88 and 0.7-39% of total sequence reads at MV#14 and MV#1, respectively. Some phyla, such as Firmicutes, Aerophobetes (formerly CD12), and Aminicenantes were prevalent only in the sediment samples. The degree of similarity between microbial communities in sediment and seawater was determined by nMDS analysis applied to OTUs with >97% similarity (Figure 5) . Microbial communities in the overlying seawater from 200 to 300 m above the mud volcano summits were generally similar. Compared to the seawater communities, microbial communities in sediments were more diverse, even across very small changes in depth at 2 and 6 mbsf for the SMVs and reference stratified marginal sediments. Microbial communities in stratified sediments were grouped into one cluster despite being collected from geographically distinct sites, whereas the microbial communities in SMV sediments were different from those in both the stratified sediments and in the overlying water column. A gradation in microbial composition is evident from deep to shallow sediment within both SMVs. These trends suggest that physical and chemical conditions may affect microbial composition more than can be explained by the conditions in well-stratified sediment. The nMDS plots (Figure 5 ) also indicate that shallower SMV sediment communities, especially at MV#14, are similar to those in normal stratified marine sediments. This difference might suggest differences in activity of the SMVs: if MV#1 is more active than MV#14, the seafloor at MV#14 would be covered with marine sediments freshly deposited since the last eruption; consequently, shallower sediments at MV#14 would harbor the microbial communities that typically occur in the surrounding stratified sediments. We identified the common OTUs in all SMV sediment and seawater samples to determine whether mud volcano activity dispersed some of the community members of the subseafloor sedimentary habitats at SMVs to the overlying seawater. We found only one OTU (i.e., OTU-1) common to all of the samples examined for both sites (MV#1 and MV#14). OTU-1 is the most abundant OTU in the SMV sediment samples, comprising 1.4-38 and 22-85% of the sequence reads from MV#1 and MV#14, respectively. OTU-1 sequences are affiliated with Atribacteria, which is well-known as a predominant taxonomic clade of marine sedimentary bacteria (e.g., Inagaki et al., 2006; Webster et al., 2006b; Blazejak and Schippers, 2010) ; almost all Atribacteriarelated sequences detected in this study are included in this OTU (Supplementary Figure 5) . The relative abundance of OTU-1-related sequences was generally low in seawater samples, comprising less than 0.1% of total reads. This abundance peaked, however, to more than 0.7% at 39 m (MV#1) and 52 m (MV#14) above the summits of both SMVs and returned to around 0.1% above this depth (Figure 6) . Interestingly, the depth profile of methane similarly peaked at 19 m (MV#1) and 72 m (MV#14) above the summit, indicating the presence of Atribacteria in methane plumes emanating from the SMVs. Because the relative abundance of OTU-1 in sequence libraries are not necessarily quantitative, we verified the presence and abundance of Atribacteria in seawater samples by CARD-FISH using the newly designed probe Atri578, which specifically targets the Atribacteria-related sequences detected in this study and related sequences in publicly available databases (Figure 7) . CARD-FISH analysis showed that Atribacteria in the water column were most abundant at 39 m (MV#1) and 52 m (MV#14) above the respective summits; results overall in good agreement with the relative abundance of OTU-1 sequence. Consequently, we infer that Atribacteria inhabiting the subseafloor sediments at SMVs are dispersed into the overlying seawater along with the methane plume. The mechanisms of dispersal of microbial life from the deep biosphere to the Earth's surface biosphere remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed that deep-biosphere microbial communities are transported from deep subseafloor sedimentary environments to the ocean through the activity of SMVs; specifically, members of the Atribacteria, typically observed in the global subseafloor sedimentary environment, were found to be present in methane plumes above two SMVs. The deep-sea hydrothermal systems have been well-studied and dispersal of thermophilic microbial communities to the ocean has been well-known (Deming and Baross, 1993; Takai et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2006) . However, the diffused microbial communities inhabit around the surface of vents due to the high temperature of hydrothemal fluid and those do not come from FIGURE 6 | Depth profiles of methane concentrations, relative abundance of OTU-1 in the sequence library, and cell numbers of Atribacteria as detected by CARD-FISH using probe Atri578. OTU-1 is the most abundant OTU affiliated with Atribacteria. deep biosphere. In contrast to those systems, little is known about the dispersal and transport of microorganisms from the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere to the overlying hydrosphere. A recent molecular ecological study of microbial communities in marine sediments and the overlying seawater showed that some of the OTUs represented by abundant sequences in the sediment are also present but represented by rare sequences in the water column population (Walsh et al., 2016) ; however, the possible mechanism or the driving force for the dispersal remains unknown. In this study, we examined these scientific questions at two SMVs off Tanegashima Island, Japan. We found that Atribacteria-related sequences were prevalent throughout the sediment and overlying water column at both SMVs examined. One of the atribacterial phylotypes (i.e., OTU-1) was commonly present in all samples. It is possible that only a very small portion of the sedimentary microbial cells can be diffused from sticky mud volcano sediments into the overlying water column, so we might only be able to detect the most abundant deep biosphere-derived OTUs because of the sensitivity of sequencing analysis. In support of this idea, the second most abundant OTU in the sequence libraries of the sedimentary microbial community (OTU-12, within the Aerophobetes) was found in the water column and showed a profile similar to those of OTU-1 and Atribacteria cell counts (Supplementary Figure 6) . These consistent results suggest that there might be no selection of microbial phylotypes in the dispersal process, and hence sedimentary microbes are evenly dispersed to the overlying seawater along with discharging gasses and fluids. The candidate division JS-1 affiliated with Atribacteria was originally found in the sediment from Japan Sea (Rochelle et al., 1994) , and meanwhile the widespread distribution of this group was reported in marine sediments including organic rich deepsea sediment (Webster et al., 2006a) , shallow marine sediment (Oni et al., 2015) , tidal flats (Webster et al., 2007) and methane hydrate bearing sediment (Reed et al., 2002; Inagaki et al., 2003 Inagaki et al., , 2006 . Their relative abundance often comprised higher than 50% of sequence libraries (Newberry et al., 2004; Inagaki et al., 2006; Carr et al., 2015) . Those high abundances of Atribacteria in the methane rich sediments imply that this group was selected in high methane concentrations. In general, sediments of mud volcanoes contain high mathane concentrations and would be suitable enviromnent for Atribacteira as reported in Amsterdam mud volcano (Pachiadaki et al., 2011) . The dominance of Atribacteria in MV#1 and MV#14 in this study was consistent with those previous studies. At the Vodyanitskiy mud volcano in the Black Sea, it has been hypothesized that ANME-1 and ANME-2 archaea are associated with methane bubbles and participate in AOM in the anoxic water column (Schubert et al., 2006) . In this study, we detected methane plumes together with atribacterial cells in the oxic water column, which is an environment very different from the deep sedimentary biosphere. We semi-quantitatively compared the frequency of 16S rRNA genes of OTU-1 between seawater and sediment samples, although the number of atribacterial cells in seawater visualized by CARD-FISH could not be directly compared to those in sediment samples, for which estimates were not technically possible because of the low in situ cell densities. Our results showed that, in methane plumes, the highest abundance of OTU-1 in the sequence library approached 1% relative abundance for MV#1 and MV#14 (Figure 6 ). These abundances are much higher than previously reported, where the highest relative abundance of sedimentary communities in the water column was 0.025% for normal sedimentary environments in the open ocean (Walsh et al., 2016) . The total abundance of 16S rRNA genes determined by microfluidic dPCR in methane plumes was 1.4 × 10 4 copies/ml in samples from both SMVs. By multiplying the proportion of sequence by the gene abundance, we estimated the density of OTU-1 16S rRNA genes to be 1.2 × 10 2 copies/ml and 1.1 × 10 2 copies/ml for MV#1 and MV#14, respectively. The gene abundance in sediment pore water can be similarly estimated under the assumption that bulk density and porosity of the sediment are 1.8 g/ml and 50%, respectively (i.e., using shipboard results available in the Cruise Report of D/V Chikyu training cruise CK09-01, Leg. 1 2 ). The estimated abundance of OTU-1 16S rRNA genes in the topmost sediment of MV#1 and MV#14 are 4.4 × 10 3 and 6.3 × 10 3 copies/ml pore water, respectively, which are only 37-and 57-fold higher than those in the methane plumes in the water column at 32 and 39 m above the respective SMVs. Given these estimates, we infer that there could be a supply of substantial amounts of the subseafloor microbial community to the overlying seawater, for which we propose the term ""deepbiosphere plume."" Once sedimentary microbial components are released into the water column, it is likely that they are transported via currents as ""deep-biosphere seeds"" into the ocean, perhaps over long distances, as previously discussed for thermospores found in arctic sediments (Hubert et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, at this point, it is difficult to quantify the deep-biosphere seeds, constantly or episodically dispersed from SMVs along with methane and fluids. To expand our understanding of this interesting phenomenon involving geosystem-ecosystem interactions will require continuous monitoring of the geobiological system over a wide spatial range through future deep-sea research and ocean drilling opportunities. 2 www.godac.jamstec.go.jp In this study, by using the Atri578 probe targeting Atribacteria for CARD-FISH, we confirmed the presence of sedimentary Atribacteria in methane plumes (Figure 7) . The detected atribacterial cells were individualized cocci (diameter approximately 1.0 µm), not forming aggregates or attached to any particulate matter. Our CARD-FISH observations suggest that the Atribacteria are generally free-living in the sediment pore water rather than tightly attached to the minerals. Because CARD-FISH detects rRNA inside individual cells, the detected cells may have been still alive and in their in situ metabolic state. This led us to hypothesize that deep-biosphere seeds of Atribacteria will colonize new habitats on the seafloor and revive to start growing, freshly deposited in a sedimentary habitat after traveling a long distance in the ocean. Previous studies of the partial genome sequence of Atribacteria indicated that they are heterotrophic anaerobes that ferment organic acids, such as propionate, and produce the fermentation products acetate, ethanol, and CO 2 (Carr et al., 2015; Nobu et al., 2016) . Their fermentation products may therefore directly or syntrophically support methanogenesis or acetogenesis; that is, the terminal metabolic processes in the anoxic heterotrophic microbial ecosystem. In addition, it is worth noting that there have been no functional genes for methanotrophy so far identified in the known Atribacteriaderived genome sequences. This suggests that there may be little or no biogeochemical contributions from Atribacteria in methane plumes if they are just surviving and drifting in the water column. Their biogeochemical activities would resume when these deep-biosphere seeds are safely redeposited on the seafloor and buried back into the anoxic sedimentary habitat. The number of cells in MV#1 and MV#14 sediment samples was much lower than in well-stratified sediment core samples from Pacific margin sites. In addition, the shallower mud volcano sediment in this study contained only 10 2 -10 5 cells/g-wet, which is several orders of magnitude lower than the 10 8 -10 9 cells/cm 3 in very active and water-rich SMVs (e.g., Håkon Mosby mud volcano; Losekann et al., 2007) . This implies that cell densities in the deeper zones of MV#1 and MV#14 are possibly much lower than in other, more active SMVs. Because the SMVs near Tanegashima originated from Eocene strata (Ujiie, 2000) , it is possible that the low cell concentrations in the mud volcano sediment at this site can be explained by sediment matrices that are too deep and too old to support microbial life, and the geosystem may lack both available electron donors and acceptors. This, however, is still an open question. In this study, we investigated microbial communities at two SMVs off Tanegashima Island, Japan, using second generation sequencing, microfluidic digital PCR, image-based cell counts, and CARD-FISH techniques. Beta diversity of sediment and water-column microbial communities, as well as cell-count and gene quantification data, consistently indicated that microbial community compositions in mud volcano sediments are very distinct from those in well-stratified marginal sediments and water columns. Sedimentary Atribacteria were present in methane plumes in the overlying water column, suggesting microbial dispersal from the deep sedimentary biosphere to the overlying hydrosphere through submarine mud volcano activity. These findings suggest that a transmigration of ""deep-biosphere seeds"" may occur between the Earth's surface and subsurface biospheres.

14583627,Stratified Community Responses to Methane and Sulfate Supplies in Mud Volcano Deposits: Insights from an In Vitro Experiment,"Numerous studies on marine prokaryotic communities have postulated that a process of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled with sulfate reduction (SR) is the main methane sink in the world's oceans. AOM has also been reported in the deep biosphere. But the responses of the primary microbial players in eliciting changes in geochemical environments, specifically in methane and sulfate supplies, have yet to be fully elucidated. Marine mud volcanoes (MVs) expel a complex fluid mixture of which methane is the primary component, forming an environment in which AOM is a common phenomenon. In this context, we attempted to identify how the prokaryotic community would respond to changes in methane and sulfate intensities, which often occur in MV environments in the form of eruptions, diffusions or seepage. We applied an integrated approach, including (i) biochemical surveys of pore water originated from MV, (ii) in vitro incubation of mud breccia, and (iii) prokaryotic community structure analysis. Two distinct AOM regions were clearly detected. One is related to the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) at depth of 30-55 cm below the sea floor (bsf); the second is at 165-205 cm bsf with ten times higher rates of AOM and SR. This finding contrasts with the sulfide concentrations in pore waters and supports the suggestion that potential AOM activity below the SMTZ might be an important methane sink that is largely ignored or underestimated in oceanic methane budget calculations. Moreover, the incubation conditions below the SMTZ favor the growth of methanotrophic archaeal group ANME-2 compared to ANME-1, and promote the rapid growth and high diversity of bacterial communities. These incubation conditions also promote the increase of richness in bacterial communities. Our results provide direct evidence of the mechanisms by which deep AOM processes can affect carbon cycling in the deep biosphere and global methane biochemistry.","The existence of microbial life in the deep subsurface has been known since ZoBell's studies in the 1930s [1] and was first proven in sediment cores during drilling in the 1980s [2] . However, whether the deep biosphere is the largest prokaryotic habitat on Earth is an enigma because the estimations of cell numbers and biomass differ dramatically among sampling sites and counting techniques [3] [4] [5] . The importance of these deeply buried communities for driving carbon and nutrient cycling and for catalyzing a multitude of reactions among rocks, sediment and fluids is widely accepted [6] . Available reports demonstrate that the highest quantities of active prokaryotes are associated with diverse biogeochemical interfaces, e.g., highly organic rich sediments such as the Mediterranean sapropels [7] ; the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ), where anaerobic methanotrophy is the driving force behind local microbial activities [4] ; the deep hypersaline anoxic lakes, where the ecosystems are largely driven by sulfur cycling and methanogenesis [8] ; an increase in microbial biomass was also observed in sediments with gas hydrates [9] . Recent developments in research on the marine methane cycle have shown that the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is the key microbial action responsible for methane turnover in the ocean and is the first step in making energy available to the local ecosystem [10] . The AOM process has been proposed to involve reverse methanogenesis [11, 12] , which is coupled with sulfate reduction via anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and diverse sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) [13, 14] . Because ANME and SRB annually consume approximately 85% of oceanic methane production, the assessment of in situ AOM rates plays a vital role in global methane budget modeling [10] . Currently, estimations of in situ AOM rates are primarily based on the methane/sulfate turnover rates using radioactive tracers. Longterm incubation under simulated conditions has not been frequently reported and has only been performed at shallow sediment depths near the SMTZ [10] . Marine mud volcanoes (MVs) are among the most spectacular seepage-related geomorphological structures and produce a strong outburst of methane-saturated geofluids from the deep subsurface. The development of a MV is related to strong lateral or vertical compressions of the Earth's crust that provoke deep-lying sediments to move upward [15] . Such emitted sedimentary material is called ''mud breccia'' and represents exclusively MVrelated deposits [16] . The main gaseous component in the seeping fluids is methane, a strong greenhouse gas. In addition to methane, mixtures of wet gas, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and petroleum products are often present. Such chemically complex allochthonous sedimentary and fluid mixtures incite the development of particular environments at and below the sea floor and fuel microbial processes that shape the community structure of the chemosynthetic seepage. MVs are known to exhibit environmental heterogeneity, which is directly related to the mode of MV eruptions and to the chemistry of the expelled products. Hydrocarbon-rich fluids expelled to the surface bring up methane, which is utilized as a carbon and energy source. Because AOM is the initial step in biological energy conversion within the local ecosystem, the bioavailability of methane directly determines energy supply and the biomass in the sediment along the fluid migration pathway. Additionally, microbial AOM activity controls the storage of methane in the ocean. However, the distribution of active methane-consuming microbes, especially those that perform anaerobic methanotrophy along the sedimentary section of a MV, has yet to be sufficiently investigated. Furthermore, the organization of prokaryotic communities and their structure at varying sedimentary depths and in environments with variable methane concentrations has not been reported thus far. To test the potential for in situ AOM activity, we report the results of an in vitro incubation experiment under methane-and sulfate-rich conditions that was performed on freshly recovered mud breccia from the Ginsburg MV in the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1) . The availability of freshly erupted MV deposits allowed us to examine potential AOM activity at and below the SMTZ. We applied a vertical profile sampling strategy to reveal changes in AOM community structure and its spatial distribution at varying depths and to identify possible ecological factors that influence the community's metabolic behavior and dynamics.  Sampling location is Ginsburg MV (35u22.4319N; 07u05.2919W) in the Gulf of Cadiz. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species and no specific permissions were required for these locations/activities. The Gulf of Cadiz is an extensive embayment of the Atlantic Ocean from Cape Saint Vincent, Portugal, to the Gibraltar Strait on the southwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 1) . The area is known for its MVs [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and the Ginsburg MV is located within the Western Moroccan MV Field of the gulf. A gravity core was taken and in total 3.55 m long of mud breccia was recovered from the crater of the MV (water depth ca. 910 m; core M2007-56) during a MicroSYSTEMS cruise of R/V Pelagia in 2007. The sampling location was the same one from which cores were collected during the TTR-9 (1999) and TTR-10 (2000) cruises undertaken for hydrocarbon gas and lipid biomarker studies [22, 23] . The lithology, presence of chemosynthetic tube worms at the surface layer and gas hydrates at depths below 1 m of sediment provided a mirror image of the previously recovered MV deposits taken during several TTR cruises [17, [19] [20] [21] . The recovered sedimentary core was immediately cut into 1 m sections and opened in the cold lab container at +4uC for subsampling. Pore water samples were obtained on board at +4uC directly from mud breccia using a Rhizon Core Solution Sampler (Rhizosphere Research Products, Wageningen, the Netherlands). The sampler consisted of a 10 cm porous polymer tube, which was impermeable to bacteria to maintain the sterility of the samples, connected to a 10 cm PVC tube and a Luer-Lock connector attached to the standard 10 ml syringe. By drawing the piston, filtered pore waters were collected in the syringe in the vacuum. To assess sulfate levels, 1 ml of pore water was placed in a plastic vial and kept at 220uC. To distinguish stable carbon isotopes from dissolved inorganic carbon (d 13 C-DIC), 2 ml of pore water was preserved with 10 ml of saturated mercury chlorite solution and stored in darkness at +4uC in gas-tight glass vials without head space. Sulfide was preserved in 5 ml glass vials containing 0.5 ml of pore water and 4.5 ml of 0.1 N NaOH solution, which was initially refluxed with N 2 for 5 min. Samples with preserved H 2 S were stored at +4uC. For the incubation experiment, mud breccia samples were collected directly at 4uC. Sub-sampling was carried out along the total length of the core at 5 cm intervals using 50 ml plastic sterile syringes with cut tips. Samples were immediately sealed in trilaminate PEI aluminum bags (KENOSHA C.V., Amstelveen, the Netherlands) in a nitrogenous atmosphere and stored at +4uC until use. In off-shore laboratories, the experiments were carried in an anoxic N 2 atmosphere in a glove box (Concept 1000, L.E.D. Techno NV, Belgium). In total, 26 sections along the 2.55 m of the mud breccia section were selected. From each layer, 30 ml of fresh mud volcano deposits were diluted 5 times with artificial seawater medium in a 250 ml Scott bottle closed with a gas-tight butyl stopper. The headspace was first flushed and filled with 12 C-CH 4 at 0.1 MPa of absolute pressure (the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure) and then pressurized up to 0.15 MPa of absolute pressure by 13 C-CH 4 (99% Atom, Campro Scientific GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The Scott bottles were placed on a shaker (80 rpm shaking) at 15uC in darkness. The total duration of the experiment was 176 days. Slurry samples were taken after days 8, 21, 31, 45, 73, 102, 135, and 176 of incubation. At each selected interval, approximately 3 ml of slurry was collected through a syringe without open the bottle, completely filled into two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and centrifuged at 13,200 g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected and used for the determination of dissolved sulfide, sulfate and pH according to a previously described method [24] . The residue (,1.3 ml in each tube) was frozen at 220uC for future DNA extraction. Gas analysis was performed on samples incubated for 8 and 176 days. The gas pressure inside the incubation bottle was measured with an INFIELD 7C Tensiometer (UMS, München, Germany). From each incubation bottle, 0.5 ml of gas was removed and immediately injected into a 12 ml vacuumed gas sampling tube (Labco Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK). Next, the gas sampling tube was filled with helium up to atmospheric pressure. The CO 2 concentration (including both 13 C-CO 2 and 12 C-CO 2 ) was quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC 14B, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 2 m Porapak Q column (0.3 cm o.d., SS 80/100) and a pre-column (1 m) of the same material (both at 35uC) and a 63 Ni electron capture detector (ECD) at 250uC. The ratio between 13 C-CO 2 and 12 C-CO 2 was quantified with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS 20-20, Sercon Ltd, Cheshire, UK) coupled to a GC in a climatized room (21.060.5uC) using the same technical settings as described previously [25] . Both AOM and SR rates were expressed as nmol sulfide/CO 2 production per ml of fresh sediment per day (nmol/ml rs/d). The turnover rate was calculated according to the following formula: For the AOM rate calculation, the total production of 13 C-carbon species, i.e., 13 C-CO 2 in both liquid and gas phases, 13 C-HCO 3 2 and 13 C-H 2 CO 3 in liquid phase, was first calculated. Given that 1/3 of the initial headspace consisted of 13 C-CO 2 and 2/3 consisted of 12 C-CO 2 , the overall AOM rate was calculated as follows: Prokaryotic community analysis of the incubated samples DNA extraction. DNA extraction was performed on the samples taken on day 0 and day 176 at each sediment depth, in total 52 samples. The residue after chemical analysis was thaw and mixed, from which a 0.5 ml slurry was used to extract DNA using Fast DNA Spin Kit for soil (Bio 101, Q-Biogene, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manual supplied with the kit. The raw DNA was then purified with a DNA Purification Kit (Wizard, Promega, Madison, USA) and eluted to a final volume of 50 ml. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the prokaryotic community. To amplify bacteria, the primers 27f-FAM and 907r (Table 1) were used under the condition described in Table S1 and Table S2 . The obtained PCR product was purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted to a final volume of 30 ml. The DNA concentration in the PCR products was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA). Then, 100 ng of the purified PCR product was added to Tango buffer (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada) and digested with 2.5 units of restriction enzyme Mspl at 37uC for 3 hours. After digestion, 100 ml cold ethanol (95%) was added, and the sample was incubated at 4uC for 30 min to precipitate the digested DNA fragments. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 min. The pellet obtained from the precipitation was further washed with 100 ml cold ethanol (75%) and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was discharged, and the pellet was vacuum dried for 5 min using Savant SpeedVac DNA 110 (GMI, Minnesota, USA). To amplify archaea, a nested PCR approach was applied. The first PCR was run with primers Arch21f/Uni1392r (Table 1) under the condition described in Table S1 and Table S3 . The nested PCR was run with the primers Arch21f-FAM and Arch958r (Table 1 ) using the product from the first PCR as a template under the condition described in Table S1 and Table S4 . The products were assayed on a 1% agarose gel. Bands of the correct length on the gel were cut and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR product (100 ng) obtained from gel extractions was digested by 2.5 units of restriction enzyme Hha1 at 37uC for 3 hours. The digested DNA fragments were then washed and dried according to the procedure as described above. The resultant DNA fragments with fluorescent labels were analyzed at the Genetic Service Unit (University Hospital, Gent, Belgium). Statistical analysis of the patterns was performed using Bionumerics 5.1 software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) [26] . Extracted data were processed for ecological interpretation in the following aspects: 1) Richness-the number of bands in one T-RFLP pattern was used an indicator of community richness. 2) Community organization (Gini)-calculated from the normalized area between a given Lorenz curve and the perfect evenness line [26] . This calculation yields a single value used to describe the degree of evenness of the community. 3) Similarity via depth-used to describe the rate of community changes with sediment depth using moving window analyses [26] . The value presented is the similarity of T-RFLP patterns of two samples from the sediment depths next to each other. For example, the T-RFLP pattern of sediment sample at 20 cm bsf was compared to that of sediment sample at 10 cm bsf, and the similarity is shown as a unit of percentage in y axil. The mud breccia slurry samples from the incubation experiment were taken at days 0 and 176 and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (1 part slurry to 3 parts formaldehyde) overnight at 4uC. The fixed sample was then washed with PBS buffer twice and further diluted 2000 times with PBS. Next, 8 ml diluted slurry was filtered onto a circular GTTP polycarbonate filter (0.2 mm, Millipore, Germany) with a diameter of 2.5 cm. Cell staining and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) analysis were performed on the filter based on the protocol of Pernthaler et al [27] . DAPI (49,69-diamidino-2-phenylindol) staining was used to assess the total cell count. The probes used to identify ANME groups and SRB are listed in Table 1 . Cells were counted under a microscope (Zeiss, Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Germany) with 50 fields of view (140 mm * 90 mm) used for each hybridization. The detection limit of this method was 2*10 5 cell (aggregate)/ml raw sediment.  The sediment core from the Ginsburg MV reached 904 m of water depth and recovered 357 cm of sediment. When the core was cut open, voids, most likely from the decomposition of gas hydrates, were observed at depths of 53-58 cm, 111-113 cm, 128-133 cm, 173 cm, 193 cm, and 213-218 cm bsf. A thin layer consisting of a few mm of hemipelagic trapping was observed on the surface. In the pore water, sulfide was detected at 34-141 cm bsf (maximum 11.2 mM) and at 193 cm bsf (maximum 2.6 mM) ( Fig. 2A) . The sulfate concentration decreased from ambient seawater levels (i.e., 28.0 mM) to 4.0 mM within the top 12 cm of sediment and remained stable until 307 cm bsf; below this depth, a sharp increase was observed (Fig. 2B) . The seawater chloride concentration (54462 mM) was measured in the top 12 cm of sediment. The chloride concentrations varied from 431 to 627 mM in the top 34 cm and remained relatively stable until 297 cm bsf, with an average value of 528621 mM (Fig. 2C) . When methane and sulfate were supplied, sediments from different depths responded differently in terms of SR-AOM activities. Throughout the 176 days of the incubation period, two distinguishable active zones were formed. A shallow active zone was defined at 30-55 cm bsf in which the sediments only showed low SR activity after 102 days of incubation (Fig. 3) . The overall SR activities during the 176-day incubation period were in the range of 0.3-1.4 nmol/ml rs/d. When the SR was calculated between day 102 (when sulfide production was observed) and day 176 (the end point of the incubation), the rates were in the range of 0.6-3.2 nmol/ml rs/d. No detectable AOM activity was observed in these samples. A deeper AOM active zone was defined at 165-205 cm bsf. In the presence of methane and sulfate, this interval exhibited an immediate production of sulfide, which remained active throughout the incubation experiment (Fig. 3) . The highest SR activity, 24.7 nmol/ml rs/d, was detected at a depth of 195 cm bsf. This sediment layer also showed AOM activity, with rates of 1.4-6.2 nmol/ml rs/d (Fig. 4A) . The remainder of the mud breccia section revealed no SR or AOM activities (Fig. 3) . During the incubation experiment, diverse bacterial communities were described throughout the mud breccia sample at different sediment depths (Fig. 4B) . Throughout the incubation period, the average bacterial communities' similarity via depth increased from 68% at day 0 to 81% at day 176. After incubation, the average Fig. 4C shows that the uppermost 40 cm exhibited moderate bacterial evenness (Gini), and these values increased with increasing depth especially after incubation. In contrast, Fig. 4D shows that bacterial richness decreased with increasing depth within the top 75 cm both before and after incubations. Archaeal T-RFLP patterns could only be obtained from the uppermost 65 cm of sediment because that concentrations of archaeal cells are below the detection limit of the method applied in the present work. Compared with bacterial communities, archaeal communities showed much lower richness (Fig. 4G) .  Cell counts based on DAPI staining demonstrated that the cell concentration in the shallow active zone (i.e., sediment from 55 cm bsf) was one log unit higher than that in the deeper active zone (i.e., sediment from 195 cm bsf) ( Table 2) . After incubation, a 70% decrease in total biomass was found at a sediment depth of 55 cm bsf. Here, the abundance of ANME-1 cells remained constant, and their relative concentration increased from 6% before to 20% after the incubation. The ANME-2 and SRB contents were just above the detection limit, and ANME-3 cells were not detected. In contrast, the incubation had no effect on total cell numbers in mud breccia at 195 cm bsf but clearly stimulated the growth of ANME-2 and SRB, especially in the form of aggregates (diameter 2-10 mm) ( Table 2 ).  The Ginsburg MV is located in the eastern part of Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1) , an active MV and fluid-venting region [23, 28] . Mud breccia was collected from a relatively recent mudflow and it contained gas hydrates; the presence of gas hydrates is a known phenomenon for this MV [23] . For the last decade, the Ginsburg MV has been reported as an active structure, and its tectonic structure and geobiochemistry have been intensively studied by Figure 4 .

Cell identification and quantification by CARD-FISH. different programs and scientific groups [17, [21] [22] [23] [29] [30] [31] . In the present study, the sulfide and sulfate distribution profiles identifies the location of the SMTZ at a depth of 30-70 cm bsf (Fig. 2) . This result is in agreement with published data on hydrocarbon gases, pore water parameters and AOM/SR rates measurements from the same MV [23, 31] . Meanwhile, Figs. 2B and 2C show that at a depth of ca. 190 cm bsf, the behavior of sulfide and sulfate curves indicates the possibility of an additional AOM active zone. The sulfate profile clearly suggests an alternative to the seawater sulfate source, the nature of which has thus far not been elucidated. The occurrence of specific void-like structures resulting from the dissociation of gas hydrates was also documented within the same mud breccia interval. Accordingly, pore water parameters suggest two potentially active AOM intervals within the uppermost 2.5 m of mud breccia. The evidence of two separate active AOM zones is also supported by the in vitro incubation experiment in which additional methane and sulfate were supplied. Under these conditions, immediate and/or delayed SR was detected within similar sedimentary layers, i.e., at 30-55 cm bsf and at 165-205 cm bsf. Furthermore, despite the low sulfide concentrations in the pore water, mud breccia from the deep AOM zone showed immediate SR and AOM activity that was ten times higher than the activity in the AOM interval above (Fig. 4A) . Therefore, the vertical distribution profiles of pore water form a valuable tool for targeting the potential AOM active zones but are not necessarily sufficient to quantify the rates of the process. Although measured in vitro activity is strongly affected by the incubation conditions, in vitro measurements remain a valuable indicator for understanding in situ microbial activity. We are aware that in this study, the incubation was performed as single microcosms without replicates due to the biomass limitation, which may cause bias. Still, the sediment depths with AOM activity were clustered into two intervals, which is strong evidence to locate the AOM active zones. The in vitro experiments led to the hypothesis that, in the presence of necessary electron donors and acceptors, anaerobic methanotrophy can be fuelled and sustained even at great sedimentary depths. The discovery of multiple AOM active intervals in one sediment core suggests that deep AOM activity should not be overlooked in methane budget calculations. Based on the currently available data, the sources and sinks of oceanic methane are not balanced with the standing stock. For example, according to the estimated data from Reeburgh [10] , the reciprocal of the measured and modeled specific turnover rates for the deep ocean (0.01-0.02 year ) yields an estimated residence time of between 2 and 3 years based on the addition of methane. These data on methane turnover rate to calculate the budget were often generated from in situ or in vitro radioactive tracer incubations, which is a sensitive method but is restricted to surface sediment and short-term monitoring. Deep or delayed methanotrophic processes have therefore been largely ignored. Based on the experimental data in this study, the deep layer AOM activity is one order of magnitude higher than that in SMTZ. This deep buried methane sink could at least partially reconcile the gap of current methane budget. Although ANME lipid biomarkers, especially ANME-1, appeared to be present in every interval of the Ginsburg MV core down to 180 cm bsf [23] , both the pore water profile and our incubation results lead to the conclusion that AOM activity is only present at certain sediment depths. It is not surprising that sediments all along the sampling core might have been exposed to a methane-and sulfate-rich environment during certain historical periods because the discharge of hydrocarbon-rich fluid is a common phenomenon in the Gulf of Cadiz and the Ginsburg MV is characterized as an active structure with extensive mud diapirism and mud volcanism. The relatively broad distribution of ANME lipids along the MV deposits indirectly indicates methane flow and, thus, a migration or displacement of the SMTZ in the Ginsburg MV [23] . The AOM microbial activity in recent or ancient SMTZs cannot be always restored within a six month period simply by providing fresh methane and sulfate in laboratory conditions, implying that the in situ development of the AOM community after methane-and sulfate-rich fluid migration is a long-term process. The incubation conditions in this study apparently favor the activity and growth of ANME-2 over ANME-1. An increase in ANME-2 cells and aggregates has been observed in both of the AOM active zones. Moreover, sediment from the deeper location, in which ANME-2 is dominant, has higher SR-AOM activity compared with that from the SMTZ, where ANME-1 is dominant. In fact, in addition to ANME-2, ANME-1 has been selectively enriched in the SMTZ; the ANME-1 cell numbers remained constant, whereas there was a 70% decay of total freeliving cells (counted by DAPI staining, Table 2 ). Alternatively, this 70% decay of cells might have contributed to heterotrophic SR and other microbial processes; however, we did not measure such processes. This incubation result is in agreement with investigations from other researchers regarding the niche differentiation of ANME-1 and ANME-2. For example, it has been suggested that compared to ANME-1, ANME-2 is dominant in environments with higher SR activity, lower flow rates, relatively elevated methane partial pressures and temperatures in the range of 10-15uC [32] [33] [34] ; such a pattern is similar to what we observed in our incubations, especially in the deeper active zone. The incubation promoted a tendency for prokaryotic communities, especially bacterial communities, at different depths to converge (Figs. 4B and 4E) . Concurrently, the bacterial community richness also rose as a result of the incubation, even in sediment intervals without detectable SR activity (Fig. 4D) . The entire incubation period lasted 176 days, at which point there was almost no overpressure inside certain incubation bottles; methane gas had been consumed by microorganisms and lost during sampling. During the incubation period, the ANME and SRB cells reproduced 1-3 times (calculated from the data in Table 2 ). Due to the extremely low growth rates of ANME and SRB (with doubling times of approximately 2 months), they are not major contributors in terms of abundance to overall prokaryotic community dynamics despite the fact that they are key players in primary production in the cold seep ecosystem. The rapid changes in community structure and the increase in richness are thought to be driven by the increase of substrate diversity during incubation [35] . Initially, methane and CO 2 were the only sources of additional carbon; later, the metabolic products of ANME and SRB and the decay of biomass allowed more complex carbon compounds to become available to the system. It must be taken into account that, due to the low biomass content from our samples, this T-RFLP analysis is unlikely to capture rare species. It has been proven that when a preconditioned community colonizes a familiar habitat, the community structure is more predictable [36] . It is therefore reasonable to believe that the species that were observed to increase using T-RFLP were also historically dominant. The increase of biodiversity suggests that a more complex metabolic network within local ecosystems was stimulated due to the incubation, whereas the increase in similarity via depth suggests that the metabolic networks at different sediment depths share similar groups of microbes. Future work with higher efficiency and sequencing data, which may be accomplished by using pyrotags, could detail such communities and their functions. In this study, we attempted to identify how the prokaryotic community would respond to changes in methane and sulfate intensities in Ginsburg MV sediment. After a long-term in vitro incubation, a deeply buried AOM active zone was discovered besides the SMTZ, where the AOM activity was one order of magnitude higher than that of SMTZ. This discovery calls up our attention that the potential AOM activity at deep subsurface even below SMTZ should not be ignored or underestimated in oceanic methane budget calculation. Moreover, the incubation condition, a highly reduced environment with high sulfate and methane concentration but no flux nor organic nutrient supply, caused a selective enrichment of ANME (especially ANME-2 rather than ANME-1) and SRB. Although ANME-2 and SRB are the main contributors to SR-AOM activity, bacteria, who may be living on the organic compounds released from cellular metabolism and decay, are taking the major part to shape the overall community structure. This study provides direct information regarding to the spatial distribution and activity of archaea and bacteria in cold seep environments.  ",Yu Zhang,2014,25393146,10.1371/journal.pone.0113004
28363766,Cellular immune responses and phagocytic activity of fishes exposed to pollution of volcano mud.,"Since May 29, 2006, a mud volcano in the Brantas Delta of the Sidoarjo district has emitted mud that has inundated nearby villages. Pollution in this area has been implicated in detrimental effects on fish health. In fishes, leukocyte and phagocytic cells play a vital role in body defenses. We report for the first time the effect of ""LUSI"" volcano mud on the immune systems of fish in the Brantas Delta. The aim of this study was to find biomarkers to allow the evaluation of the effects of volcanic mud and anthropogenic pollution on fish health in the Brantas Delta. The study took places at the Brantas Delta, which was polluted by volcano mud, and at reference sites in Karangkates and Pasuruan. Leukocyte numbers were determined using a Neubauer hemocytometer and a light microscope. Differential leukocyte counts were determined using blood smears stained with May Grunwald-Giemsa, providing neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts. Macrophages were taken from fish kidney, and their phagocytic activity was measured. In vitro analyses revealed that leukocyte and differential leukocyte counts (DLC) were higher in Channa striata and Chanos chanos caught from the polluted area. Macrophage numbers were higher in Oreochromis mossambicus than in the other species, indicating that this species is more sensitive to pollution. In areas close to volcanic mud eruption, all specimens had lower phagocytic activity. Our results show that immune cells were changed and phagocytic activity was reduced in the polluted area indicating cytotoxicity and alteration of the innate immune system in fishes exposed to LUSI volcano mud and anthropogenic pollution.",N/A,Yenny Risjani,2014,24631200,10.1016/j.marenvres.2014.02.004

8249528,Acoustic scattering from mud volcanoes and carbonate mounds,"Submarine mud volcanoes occur in many parts of the world’s oceans and form an aperture for gas and fluidized mud emission from within the earth’s crust. Their characteristics are of considerable interest to the geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and underwater acoustics communities. For the latter, mud volcanoes are of interest in part because they pose a potential source of clutter for active sonar. Close-range (single-interaction) scattering measurements from a mud volcano in the Straits of Sicily show scattering 10–15dB above the background. Three hypotheses were examined concerning the scattering mechanism: (1) gas entrained in sediment at/near mud volcano, (2) gas bubbles and/or particulates (emitted) in the water column, (3) the carbonate bio-construction covering the mud volcano edifice. The experimental evidence, including visual, acoustic, and nonacoustic sensors, rules out the second hypothesis (at least during the observation time) and suggests that, for this particular mud volcano the dominant...","One of the important problems limiting active sonar performance in shallow water is the large number of false targets. Scattering that produces ""target-like"" echoes is defined here as clutter. Sonar clutter can arise from a variety of ocean features. High scattering has been observed from biologics ͑e.g., Ref. 1͒ and anthropogenic features such as wellheads and wrecks ͑e.g., Refs. 2 and 3͒. In shallow water, much of the observed clutter is believed to arise from features on and under the seabed. Seabed features ͑and the associated scattering mechanisms͒ that lead to clutter have not been well studied in the past; in particular the characteristic scattering and its dependencies upon incident and scattered vertical angle, azimuth and frequency are poorly understood. One potential source of clutter from the seabed is mud volcanoes and carbonate mounds. Mud volcanoes form due to the rise of fluidized sediments and/or gas along a fault or on top of a seafloor-piercing shale diapir. They may occur in sedimentary areas with hydrocarbon generation at depth, originate from thick clay beds, usually erupt along fault lines, and often bubble gas ͑mostly methane͒, and sometimes oil. At least 300 mud volcanoes are known to exist on the ocean shelves, 4 mainly within the petroliferous basins. They are known to occur in a variety of geologic settings, including the abyssal parts of inland seas, active margins, continental slopes of passive margins, and continental shelves. A recent review article estimates the number of deep-water submarine mud volcanoes at 10 3 -10 5 . 5 Mud volcanoes studied along the Mediterranean Ridge at water depths ϳ2000 m are of order several 10 3 m in diameter and 10 2 m in height ͑e.g., Ref. 6͒. Deep-water mud volcanoes often are associated with gas hydrates. Much less is known about shallow water mud volcanoes, and it is anticipated that continued advances in ocean exploration will bring new discoveries of mud volcanoes in areas presently not associated with mud volcanism. The recently discovered mud volcanoes in the Straits of Sicily 7 are much smaller ͑of order 10 1 to 10 2 in diameter and several meters in height͒ than their deep-water counterparts. They occur in water depths of 70-170 m ͑too shallow for gas hydrates͒ along the Scicli fault zone. Seismic reflection data ͑discussed in Ref. 7 and Sec. III B͒ show diapiric structures beneath coneshaped structures, which are typical of mud volcanism. Though we do not have absolute proof that these features are mud volcanoes ͑a core sample would be required͒, we use the term mud volcanoes in the same sense as Ref. 8 , given the apparent presence of carbonate mounds. The objectives of this research were to identify the scattering mechanism associated with a single mud volcano ͑MV͒ and determine the frequency and angular dependence of the scattering. For the scattering mechanism, the three hypotheses that seem most probable are: ͑1͒ gas bubbles ͑emitted͒ in the water column; ͑2͒ gas entrained in sediment at/near mud volcano; and ͑3͒ structure itself ͑carbonate pavements and/or chimneys͒ The measurements were designed to determine which mechanism͑s͒ play a significant role in the scattering and the commensurate clutter. Through long-range reverberation, clutter features can be detected and localized. Long-range broadband ͑200-2000 Hz͒ reverberation measurements in the Malta Plateau ͑unpublished data͒ have shown significant clutter at the locations of some of the mud volcanoes ͑MVs͒. In the area of interest ͑see Site 18 box in Fig. 1͒ scattered returns from the MVs are 10-20 dB above the background reverberation and have been observed from distances up to 22 km. However, at long ranges, quantifying scattering characteristics of the feature, e.g., identifying the scattering mechanism, can be difficult or impossible. This is because uncertainties in the propagation paths, i.e., mechanisms dominating the propagation to and from the scatterer ͑both related to the oceanography and the seabed geoacoustics͒ are typically quite large. An alternative approach is to probe the clutter features at close range using a direct path scattering technique. Direct path scattering observations offer two significant advantages: ͑a͒ the uncertainties associated with propagation ͑through a generally sparsely sampled ocean͒ are minimized, and ͑b͒ the measurement geometries are favorable to producing data from which hypotheses about the scattering mechanisms can be directly tested. Our experimental approach, adapted from a scattering technique designed for diffuse scattering, is discussed in more detail in Sec. IV A. Before discussing the scattering technique, we summarize ͑in Sec. III͒ what is known about the mud volcanoes from geophysical sensors and visual observations. In order to identify potential scattering mechanisms, a variety of measurements were made on and around the MVs. These include bathymetry and seafloor backscatter data collected with a Reason 8101 240 kHz multibeam echo sounder, 300 kHz water column backscatter collected with an RDI acoustic Doppler current profiler ͑ADCP͒, and temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen above the suspected mud volcano using a Seabird CTD sensor. Additionally, an instrumented module ͑GAS-SCIPACK͒ 9 was deployed. These data were collected during the Boundary2004 Experiment within a few days of the low frequency acoustic scattering experiment ͑described later in Sec. IV͒. Seismic reflection data and sidescan data were collected during prior campaigns ͑2000 and 2002͒. The experimental area, the Malta Plateau in the Straits of Sicily ͑Fig. 1͒, occupies the northern edge of the North African passive continental margin and is a submerged section of the Hyblean Plateau of mainland Sicily. While several clusters of mud volcanoes have been identified on the Malta Plateau, our interest here is focused on the MV cluster at Site 18 shown in Fig. 2 . The seafloor in Fig. 2 is gently sloped, from a depth of 164 m in the northeast corner of the survey to 167 m in the southwest corner. Several MVs are visible, rising to a maximum of approximately 5 m above the mean seafloor depth. The outer length scales observed in these features are quite variable, ranging from 40 to 400 m. Also visible in the data are nearly linear depressions adjacent to some of the larger MVs that may be associated with faults and/or regions of fluid escape. The multibeam sounding resolution varied across the swath from approximately 4 to 10 m in the across-track direction, and 2.5 m in the along-track direction. In postprocessing, the data have been low pass filtered, so that the resolution of in Fig. 2 is approximately 10 m. An acoustic backscatter value associated with each multibeam bottom detection ͑one value for each beam on every ping͒ was also recorded in the raw multibeam data record. In order to compare different areas on the seafloor, these data were first corrected for any range and angle dependencies not associated with seafloor characteristics ͑simi-lar to Ref. 10͒. Our main interest here is only in distinguishing between different types of seafloor, and so only relative backscatter values are required. The strong angular dependence in the backscatter makes it difficult to identify different seafloor types in the data, and so the backscatter data are converted into a mosaic of values representing the backscatter that would be expected at a fixed grazing angle ͑70°͒. For each backscatter value, this is done by subtracting a predicted difference ͑in dB͒ for the backscatter at its true grazing angle from the predicted backscatter at 70°. Predicted backscatter values are derived from an empirical second degree polynomial fit that describes the angular dependence of all of the backscatter data within 40 m of the backscatter value in question. Although this method can introduce artifacts into the resulting mosaic, these artifacts should be on scales that are less than approximately 40 m, and the larger scale seafloor structure should remain largely unchanged. The result of this process is shown in Fig. 2͑b͒ . Note that for each of the MVs ͑bathymetric highs͒ the corresponding scattering is relatively high. In general, for regions between the bathymetric highs, the scattering strength is lower. However, there are several discrete high scattering patches that do not correspond with an apparent bathymetric high ͑which might be because there are small mounds below the multibeam resolution͒. The backscattering data show three distinct regions: the background ͑ϳ87 dB, arbitrary units that are proportional to acoustic backscatter͒, intermediate regions that are 2 -4 dB above the background, and high backscatter regions which are 6 -10 dB above the background. These three regions will be discussed again in the context of the visual observations ͑Sec. III C͒. Sidescan data ͑Fig. 3͒ were collected using an Edgetech DF-100 along a 6 km line that cut through the central part of the multibeam survey box ͓see thick gray line in Fig. 7͑b͔͒ . The sidescan data clearly show three groups of features with high scattering; the easternmost and westernmost features can be clearly seen in the multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data ͑Fig. 2͒. The high scattering from near the center of the image does not have a clear counterpart in the bathymetry ͓Fig. 2͑a͔͒ but does in the multibeam backscatter data ͓Fig. 2͑b͔͒. Raw sidescan data at the largest mound ͑Fig. 4͒ show protrusions on the mound roughly 10 m in lateral dimension and up to 4 m in height ͑calculated from the shadow length͒. From the shadow characteristics ͑also see Fig. 4 of Ref. 7͒ these protrusions appear to be constructed of cemented or consolidated sediment. These protrusions are believed to be carbonate chimneys. Note that the carbonate chimneys are not resolved in the multibeam data ͑Fig. 2͒. Sub-bottom seismic reflection data were collected with an EG&G Uniboomer ͑Fig. 5͒. The western most and easternmost MVs are clearly seen at around 5 and 5.5 km, respectively. Note the indication of an acoustic shadow underneath the MVs which might be caused by the high impedance associated with the mounds, or possibly gas. Deeper layers show no clear indications of gas. Geochemical and visual oceanographic observations were performed using the GAS-SCIPACK module, an instrumented module for casts and towed surveys close to the seabed. 9 The module was equipped with two solid-state methane sensors ͑K-METS, Capsum, Germany͒, CTD and transmissometer ͑Idronaut 316͒, 12 Niskin 2.5 l bottles ͑General Oceanics 1015͒, echo sounder ͑Tritech PA500͒, color camera ͑Deep Sea Power & Light MULTI-SEACAM 2050 color͒, Light DL 1040 ͑120 V / 250 W͒, attitude sensors ͑heading, pitch, roll͒ and internal status sensors ͑internal T, voltage, current, water detector͒. Sensor data and images were displayed in real time in an onboard console composed by a PC, TV, and video recorder. GAS-SCIPACK depth and direction were controlled following communications among console operators, winch driver, and navigating officer. Tow depths were typically a few meters above the seafloor. Though measurements were conducted at eight different sites on the Malta Plateau, we report here mainly on the Site 18 results.  Bubbles were not visually detected at any of the eight sites. Two of the sites showed enriched benthic and pelagic biomass ͑Gorgonia, worms, fishes͒ and calcareous algae fixed on apparently cemented sediments. Only Site 18 ͑where the scattering measurements were conducted, see The underwater video observations from Site 18 indicate seabed variability that is characterized by three distinct classes. The seafloor image in Fig. 6͑a͒ shows a very soft, fine-grained sediment with evidence of bioturbation, which is characteristic of large areas of the seafloor a few tens of meters away from the MVs. This soft seafloor is in stark contrast to the seafloor image shown in Figs. 6͑c͒ and 6͑d͒ over the MVs. A third seafloor type- Fig. 6͑b͒ , found on the perimeter of the MVs, appears to be coarse-grained material ͑presumably weathered/eroded material from the carbonate mounds͒ and shows no evidence of bioturbation. These three bottom types-fine-grained, coarse-grained, and carbonate blocks and fragments-correspond reasonably well to the three different 240 kHz backscatter regions: background, intermediate, and high backscatter, respectively ͑see Sec. III A͒. A total of 18 seawater samples were collected at eight sites. Seawater samples were collected in 200 ml glass bottles, sealed with silicon septa and aluminium caps. Methane analyses were performed on board by head-space extraction ͑double syringe technique 11, 12 ͒, in thermostatic conditions, and GC-FID ͑gas chromatography-flame ionization detector͒; Autofim II, Telegan, UK; detection limit 0.1 ppm, accuracy 4%-5%. The reproducibility of replicate headspace samples was within ±15%, as determined from ten water samples in atmospheric equilibrium. Calibration was performed using atmospheric samples and Scotty II standards. Concentrations of methane above 2 -4 nMol/ l ͑equilib-rium value with the atmosphere at the site-specific salinity temperature͒ are considered anomalous. Methane anomalies ͑tens of nMol/ l͒ were detected in all seawater samples collected close to the seafloor sediments. The highest concentrations ͑Ͼ200 nMol/ l͒ were found at two locations ͑36.4275°N 14.6434°E and 36.5708°N 14.4313°E͒ exhibiting similar bathymetric features as in Fig. 2 . The latter location corresponds to Site 18-close to the location of the acoustic scattering measurements. At Site 18 a concentration of 300 nMol/ l was measured. The solid-state methane sensors provided three pieces of useful information. First, they confirmed background levels of tens of nMol/ l across the area. At locations where the GC-FID showed high levels of methane, the solid-state sensors generally did not detect an increase. This is attributed to the relatively slow response time of the sensors ͑2-3 min͒. Second, given the response time and the drift speed of the vessel ͑less than about 1 knot͒, the indication is that the high levels of methane must exist over lateral dimension much smaller than ϳ50 m ͑at several meters above the seafloor͒. Finally, the sensors are quite sensitive to the presence of bubbles; however, no bubbles were detected during any of the tows. Acoustic backscatter data from the hull-mounted ADCP on R/V Alliance were collected during one night where the R/V Alliance rotated between several MVs at Site 18, performing station keeping maneuvers for 20-45 min at each position. An example of the data collected corresponding to one of the four ADCP beams is shown in Fig. 7͑a͒ , with the ship's position during this time shown in Fig. 7͑b͒ . There are two distinct types of features in this data: ͑1͒ a group of scatterers spread over the entire bathymetric feature in a thin layer at a nearly constant depth of ϳ95 m, and ͑2͒ one or more plumes that are relatively large in their vertical extent ͑between 100 and 150 m͒. The acoustic backscatter in the horizontal layer is much lower than the backscatter from the vertical plumes, indicating that these are clouds of scatterers with either different number densities, different types, or both. Further, note that the plumes present over the mound located at 36.5725 N, 14.438 E between 01:10 and 01:55 local time appear to be gone 5 1 2 h later, although it is possible that the ADCP beam simply did not intersect the plume at that later time. The plumes found at 36.573 N, 14.430 E are present during both times that the ship was at that station. Measurements with a SeaBird CTD system ͑with an SBE 43 Oxygen sensor͒ taken between 22:08 and 22:51 local time several nights later show a very slight increase in dissolved FIG. 6 . Seafloor images ͑left to right͒ from the study area exhibiting ͑a͒ a soft fine-grained sediment; ͑b͒ coarse grained sediment surrounding the MVs; ͑c͒-͑d͒ carbonate heterogeneous crust and blocks on the MVs, ranging from centimeter to meter scale. The field of view is approximately 3 ϫ 2.5 m. oxygen over the largest MV as compared to the surrounding regions ͑slightly less than a 1% difference͒. These data indicate that a chemotrophic food chain may be present, where the base of the food chain uses methane rather than photosynthesis as its energy source ͑similar to that described for pockmarks found in the North Sea, ͑Ref. 13, see page 56͔͒. Such a food chain may also support plankton and possibly nekton, which seems the most likely cause of the ""plumes"" in the ADCP backscatter data. Hovland and Judd 13 also suggest that fluid seepages can suspend nutrients that would otherwise be trapped in sediments, acting as an alternate mechanism at the base of the food chain. Although no evidence of seepage was found during the CTD drift, it is difficult to rule this out because of the possibility that the seepage is episodic. Another hypothesis that could explain the backscatter in the water column is that bubbles are being released from the sites where mounds are present. If this were happening, however, the O 2 anomaly would be expected to have the opposite sign, since dissolved oxygen would be diffusing into the methane bubbles as they rose through the water column, e.g., Ref. 4 ͑although the ADCP and the CTD measurements were not taken simultaneously͒. Mud volcanoes of sizes O͑10 1-2 ͒ m in lateral dimension and several meters in height were observed on the outer shelf of the western Malta Plateau. There was no biomass observed on these MVs ͑in contrast to significant biomass observed on MVs roughly 25 km to the southeast͒. This may be because this is an active or recently active site, so that there may be insufficient time for biomass to have developed. The presence of high aqueous concentrations of methane near the MVs is certain, although there was no clear indication of gas in bubbles either in the sediment or in the water column. Between the sidescan and multibeam data our picture is of protrusions or carbonate chimneys roughly 10 m in lateral dimension and several meters high that are sometimes isolated but typically clustered on larger mounds. Given the observations, it appears that the most likely mechanism for low frequency scattering is scattering from the carbonate mound itself and/or the carbonate chimneys on top of the mounds. While no measurements have been made on the material, it is apparently consolidated and so would have a relatively large impedance contrast relative to the water column which means not only that the scattering could be potentially large, but that scattering from within the MV ͑e.g., from gas bubbles entrained in the sediment͒ might be relatively hard to detect. While the observations suggest the lack of free gas bubbles, perhaps none of the hypotheses can be completely ruled out due to the potentially episodic nature of gas release. The objective of the low-frequency ͑800-3600 Hz͒ scattering experiment was to measure the scattering associated with a single mud volcano at close range. The MV selected for the scattering measurements, the largest mound in the cluster ͑at 36.5716°N 14.4383°E in Fig. 2͒ , is roughly elliptical with dimension 150 m ϫ 50 m and oriented at 145°͑ re North͒. During the measurement period ͑1559-1609 UTC 21 May, 2004͒ the winds were light, less than a few m/s, with a sea state 1 and the vessel drifted along the track shown in Fig. 7͑b͒ , about 75°relative to the axis of the MV. The main challenge of the short-range scattering experiment is to avoid or control multipaths. One multipath problem is potential contamination by sub-bottom reflections. It is well known that scattering may arise from not only the interface but also from sub-bottom inhomogeneities or horizons. However, sub-bottom reflections at normal incidence contaminate the scattering measurement, since the normal incidence reflections ͑even from sub-bottom horizons͒ are often at higher amplitude than scattering at lower angles. A second multipath problem is contamination from hybrid paths. Hybrid paths are paths that belong to a different family of scattering events that arrive at the same time as the scattering path that is being measured. Figures 8 and 9 show the various paths and their relationship in time and angle. For example, in this geometry, beyond about 0.4 s, the monostatic ͑path a͒ and vertically bistatic paths ͑b, c, and d͒ cannot be separated in time or angle. By vertically bistatic we mean that the incident and scattered angles are different in the vertical plane. A receive and/or source array with vertical aperture can be used to control both types of multipaths, i.e., by reducing the contribution of the normal incidence reflections and also providing some discrimination against the various scattering paths. Figure 10 depicts the system employed in this study. The vertical aperture of the receive array helps minimize effects of multipath. Short pulses ͑typically 15 ms͒ from transducers near the bottom of the array provided a repeatable and stable source. The equipment is deployed from the forecastle and the ship was left to drift. The weight of the Mod-40s ͑90 kg in water͒ provides enough ballast to keep the array straight when the current shear is small. A small fin ͑not shown͒ on the Mod40 frame stabilizes the array against rotational forces. The source array was constructed with pairs at / 2 spacing in the vertical so that transmitting in phase would yield a null in the vertical plane. The mid-frequency source array was constructed of 3 ITC-4001 transducers spaced at 20. sponse, but the differences are not significant for this study, since the focus is on low grazing angle scattering that would be important for long-range clutter. Ping types included both CW and LFM pulses of 15 ms pulse length. Repetition rates of 6 pings/ min were used, and the acquisition system was triggered 1 s before transmit to acquire ambient noise for each ping. Fifteen pings were collected for each frequency. The receive array consisted of 32 Benthos AQ-4 hydrophones with a 0.18 m spacing hardwired directly to the NATO Research Vessel ͑NRV͒ Alliance. The data were sampled at 12 kHz and low pass filtered at 3.8 kHz with a seven-pole six-zero elliptic ͑70 dB per octave roll off͒ antialias filter. The RC high pass filter ͑6 dB per octave roll off͒ was set at 500 Hz. A high speed digital link within the array provided programmable signal conditioning, digitization, and serialization of the signals. Following signal conditioning, data were beamformed ͑Hanning shading͒ using a plane wave time domain beamformer. 16 Beams were spaced to yield 3 dB down crossing points at the design frequency of the array. The data are filtered in 200 Hz bands with a sixth order low pass digital elliptic filter with 0.5 dB of ripple in the passband and a stopband 50 dB down. Receive array depth and the total water depth are determined using the arrival times of the surface and bottom reflected paths. Experimental results from a control area ͑i.e., flat seabed͒ are shown in Fig. 12 . The water depth and source depth are 128 and 91 m, respectively. Zero time in the figure corresponds to the direct blast, which overloads the array and is seen on all beams. The surface reflection is visible at 0.18 s. Clear arrival paths can be understood in terms of the various monostatic and bistatic scattering paths of Figs. 8 and 9. This experimental method has been used in the past ͑e.g., Refs. 15 and 17͒ to obtain diffuse scattering strength, i.e., scattering strength versus angle for seabeds that are homogenous ͑in a gross sense͒ over scales of hundreds of meters. In the following, we adapt the method to be able to measure scattering from discrete scatterers. An example of the measured beam time series near the MV is provided in Fig. 13͑a͒ . A discrete scatterer would be expected to be visible in the beam time series along one or more of the various paths ͓see Fig. 13͑b͔͒ . The scattering from the MV can be seen on the monostatic path ͑path a͒ at about 0.48 s and is ϳ10-15 dB above the diffuse scattering from the surrounding seabed. The angle associated with this path and range is +5°͑i.e., 5°down͒. The bistatic MVsurface reflected path ͑path e͒ is seen at −40°at 0.55 s. The reciprocal path ͑surface-MV or path b͒ occurs at the same time but at +5°. Note that its level is reduced relative to path e because of the source beampattern. The MV-surfacebottom path ͑path d͒ occurs at 0.57 s and a scattered angle of about 45°. One of the important aspects of the analysis pertains to identification of the scattering mechanism. Each of the hy-FIG. 12. Scattering ͑in dB͒ from a ""uniform"" seabed as seen by the vertical array from a single ping at 3600 Hz. The various paths evolution in time and angle correspond to those shown in Fig. 9 . The arrival at 0.18 s, observed on nearly all beams, is the surface reflected path.

Note returns from direct-direct ͑path a͒, direct-surface reflected ͑path e͒ and surface bottom ͑path d͒. The surfacedirect ͑path b͒ can also be faintly seen at the same time as the direct-surface ͑path e͒ and on the same beam as the direct-direct ͑path a͒. The path geometries are shown in Fig. 8 . The key points of the figure are that scattering from the MV is ϳ10-15 dB above the scattering from the surrounding seabed, that the scattering occurs at grazing angles slightly lower ͑closer to the horizontal͒ than from the background sediment, and finally that there is no significant scattering in the water column. potheses can be examined in light of the beam-time series data ͓Fig. 13͑a͔͒. Hypothesis ͑1͒ was that the dominant scattering mechanism was from bubbles and particulates emitted from the MV. If this hypothesis was correct, then we would expect to see high scattering in the water column ͑i.e., in the beams corresponding to 0°to −48°͑the angle associated with surface scattering at that range͒. However, there is no evidence in the data of scattering within the water column ͑scat-tering levels in the water column are ϳ40 dB lower than the scattering from the seabed͒. The data indicate that hypothesis 1 is not correct during the time period of the observations. Hypothesis 2 stated that the dominant scattering mechanism was from gas trapped under, around or within the MV. Inspection of Fig. 13 shows that the strongest arrival is actually a few degrees higher than the scattering from the surrounding seabed at the same instant in time. It is easiest to see this on the monostatic path, path a. This means that the scattering is coming from above the seabed ͑though the vertical resolution is insufficient to quantify how high͒. In Fig. 14, beam time series are shown for a different ping. In this ping several scattering highlights on given path from the MV are apparent ͑seems to occur in less than 50% of the pings͒. These events occur 18 ms apart ͑27 m in round trip travel͒ and it seems most likely that they come from two distinct features on the MV. At 800 Hz ͑Fig. 15͒, the receive beams are so wide in the vertical, that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish paths d and e from surface scattering and bottom scattering events. Since the source beam pattern is omni directional, generally both paths a and b are visible. Hypothesis 3 was that the dominant scattering mechanism was from the structure itself. The evidence from the beam-times series data indicates that this is the most likely mechanism. Futhermore, it seems most likely that the scattering arises from the carbonate chimneys which rise from the top of the MV. However, bubbles in the MV itself ͑but higher than the water depths surrounding the MV͒ cannot be completely ruled out. The scattered intensity I from the MV can be written: where I o is the source intensity, 10 log 10 ͑s t ͒ is the target strength and ␦ is a transmission factor from the source to the scattering patch ͑subscript i͒ and the reverse path ͑sub-script s͒; −10 log 10 ͑␦͒ is the one-way transmission loss͒. The scattered intensity is measured by taking the peak level within a small time window around the expected arrival time. The source intensity was monitored by a hydrophone above the source, but since the hydrophone is in the null of the source beam pattern, a more robust estimate was made using the recorded power amplifier drive voltage and the calibrated transducer response curves. The transmission factors are estimated by assuming spherical spreading. This is reasonable since the sound speed profile is nearly isovelocity near the seabed ͑see Fig. 16͒ and the surface reflected paths are at steep angles ͑Ͼ30°͒. For the angles probed, the difference between the two-way transmission loss using the isovelocity assumption and that using the measured profile is less than 1 dB and the difference in angles between source and receiver above 3°is less than 0.3°. Assuming incoherent summation of paths: where r is the distance along the path ͑incident i or scattered s͒, N is the number of arrivals that contribute within the pulse length, and R is the intensity reflection coefficient from M boundary interactions. Assuming that the scattering event takes place on the MV ͑i.e., elevated somewhat relative to the surrounding seabed͒ both the direct and the bottom reflected paths contribute to the observed scattering ͑see Fig.  16͒ . The direct and bottom reflected paths arrive at the scat- tering patch within less than a millisecond ͑i.e., much smaller than a pulse length͒ so N i = 2. For the monostatic 18 path ͑path a͒ since the paths are reciprocal N s = 2. However, for the bistatic paths ͑paths b, d, and e͒ the receiver is high enough above the seabed that only one path contributes, N s =1. The reflection coefficients of the seabed R b and sea surface R s are estimated in the following way. For the monostatic path, path a, R b is required at 5-6°grazing ͑depending on the range between source and MV͒. These angles are below the critical angle ͑approximately 12°͒ so R b ϳ 1. The exact reflection coefficient below critical angle depends upon the attenuation which is not known to very high accuracy, nevertheless the error in target strength induced by the approximation R b = 1 is expected to be very small. For path d ͑direct-surface-bottom path͒, an estimate of R b ͑39-51°͒ is required for 1800-3600 Hz and spherical wave reflection coefficient measurements at a similar water depth ͑Site 2, for see location in Fig. 1͒ are used as a proxy. At large kd ͑where k is the wave number and d is the distance from source to bottom to receiver͒ the spherical and plane wave coefficients are very similar. For the reflection coefficient measurements d Ͼ 180 and k Ͼ 7; for the scattering measurements d Ͼ ϳ 35 and k Ͼ 7. Therefore, we assume that the spherical reflection coefficient for both the reflection and the scattering measurements is comparable and very nearly equal to the plane wave coefficient. The measured reflection loss data ͑−10 log͉͑R͉͒͒ are shown in Fig. 17; and the values at the angles of interest are given in Table I . As a check on the assumption that using the measured reflection coefficient from Site 2 is reasonable near the MV, R b can be computed in another way. Given the fact the angles between paths d and e are so similar, R b can be estimated from the beam time series data at the MV as TABLE I. Bottom loss ͑BL͒ estimates. the BL measured at site 2 includes the frequency band over which it was averaged ͑closest 1 / 3 band or bands͒ and the number of angles over which the data were averaged. where I d and I e are the received intensities from paths d and e, respectively, and ␥ s is the transmission factor along the path from scatterer to receiver ͑although the transmission factors were computed, their ratio is very nearly unity since the paths are nearly identical at these ranges͒. The values of R b derived in this fashion agree with those from Site 2 ͑see Table I͒ within the error bounds and thus give confidence that the reflection coefficient near the MV is similar that at Site 2. For sea surface reflection we use ͑see Ref. 19͒ where is the rms waveheight and the phase is assumed to be −. The rms waveheight measured by a directional waverider buoy during the experimental period leads to 0.95 Ͻ ͉R s ͑38-46°, 1800-3600 Hz͉͒ Ͻ 1. The measured monostatic ͑Ϫ͒ target strength computed with the model above is shown in Fig. 18 . The grazing angles associated with the direct path ͑indicated by ""dir""͒ are provided in the legend. Also shown is the vertically bistatic target strengths ͑surface reflected path e͒ and ͑surface-bottom reflected path d͒ except at 800 Hz, where the beamwidths were too large for adequate spatial separation. In principle, we could have used the reciprocal paths b and c at 800 Hz, but in practice there was too much uncertainty in the path identification. The ordinate in Fig. 18 ͑offset from the MV͒ is estimated using the travel time. Note that each frequency has a distinct set of ranges/angles because the 15 pings for each frequency were transmitted serially ͑i.e., not interleaved͒. So Fig. 18 may depend upon geometry as well as frequency, although it should be noted that the angles at the various frequencies are quite similar. There are several aspects of Fig. 18 that are important. First of all, note that the target strengths are fairly high, 4 -14 dB, which means ͑in conjunction with its size͒ that the MV could be capable of producing clutter. Second, note that the scattering is fairly stable from ping to ping ͑one ping cycle is ϳ2.5 min͒ even though geometry is changinggrazing angles decreasing slightly with range. For each path type the standard deviation is typically less than 2 dB ͑see Table II͒ . This stability suggests that the scattering mechanism is not hypersensitive to the precise geometry or geotime. This seems consistent with the evidence from the vertical array that the scattering mechanism is not due to bubble plumes in water column ͑which might lead to substantial temporal variability͒. This stability also indicates that there is a weak dependence of the scattering with vertical angle at least over a few degrees. Third, note that in Fig. 18 ͑and Table II͒ that the target strength for paths a, e and d are similar. This suggests that the scattering may be nearly isotropic in the vertical, at least from 3°to 51°͑although clearly the entire angular range is sparsely sampled͒. It is important to have some knowledge FIG. 18 . Target strength of mound at Site 18 as a function of frequency, angle, and path. Monostatic ͑path a͒ is indicated by ""dir,"" surface reflected path is indicated by ""surf"" and surface-bottom reflected is indicated by ""bott."" about the vertical angle dependence of the scattering for two reasons: ͑1͒ the dependence may help eliminate hypotheses about the scattering mechanism and ͑2͒ once the scattering mechanism is understood it may help suggest a reasonable physical model. The most likely scattering mechanism being the carbonate chimneys coupled with the nearly isotropic behavior of the scattering suggested that to first order, the MV might be considered as a visco-elastic sphere. The expressions developed by Faran 20 for an elastic sphere were extended to the visco-elastic case by allowing the wave number to become complex. The solution is written as an infinite sum of spherical basis functions; for the following cases 60 terms were sufficient to achieve convergence. The fact that the carbonate chimneys cast a sharp shadow ͑see Fig. 4͒ is indicative of consolidated sediment, which we assume is carbonate. Since the carbonate properties are not known, we have used two plausible ""end members"" as listed in Table III . The theory is compared with the measured target strengths in Fig. 19 where it should be noted that the overall levels of the target strength are not very sensitive to the material properties. The theoretical target strength has the familiar shape with Rayleigh scattering rising as k 4 below ka o ϳ 1 ͑a o is radius͒ and a roughly constant value above. The overall level is mostly controlled by the radius and scales approximately as a o 2 . The theoretical target strength for radius of a o = 5 m corresponding to the radii of the observed carbonate chimneys is in reasonable agreement with the measurements. Both the monostatic target strength and the vertically bistatic target strength ͑relative angle difference of 40°͒ were computed and are shown in Fig. 19 . Only the monostatic data are shown. While the data indicate that the vertically bistatic TS is a few dB lower than the monostatic case ͑Table II͒, the theoretical model for the sphere predicts the converse ͑Fig. 19͒-though in a gross sense both the measurements and the model predict a weak dependence on vertical bistatic angle. Though it may not be possible to draw absolute conclusions from the modeling, the results ͑i.e., agreement between model and data͒ are in accordance with and help substantiate the hypothesis that the scattering comes from the carbonate chimneys ͑Fig. 4͒. These features have dimensions close to that of the proxy sphere: lateral radial dimension of ϳ5 m and heights of around 2 -4 m. Recall that the pulse in water has a radial dimension of 11 m, so one or several protrusions might be insonified at a given instant in time. The occurrence of multiple highlights in some pings ͑see Fig. 14͒ could arise from scattering from multiple protrusions spaced far enough apart to be temporally resolved. While the multiple highlights could also arise from near specular scattering from various facets or curved surfaces on the mound, facets and curved surfaces would not necessarily be expected to result in isotropic scattering in the vertical plane. In summary, the sphere model certainly adds weight to, but does not necessarily prove, the carbonate chimney scattering mechanism hypothesis. At the very least, the sphere model can be considered as a simple proxy, producing approximately the right levels as a function of frequency and angle. Target strength measurements on an individual mud volcano indicate that it ͑and by extension other MVs͒ are a potential source of clutter for active sonar. Target strengths of 4 -14 dB were observed from 800 to 3600 Hz for a monostatic geometry with grazing angles of 3-5°. Similar target strengths were measured for vertically bistatic paths with incident grazing angles of 3-5°and scattered angles of 33-50°. The target strengths were not very sensitive to precise geometry or geotime; typical standard deviations were ±2 dB over distances of tens of meters and order minutes. The dominant scattering mechanism for this MV appears to be scattering from the protruding carbonate chimneys; free gas bubbles did not play a significant role. However, since ebullition of bubbles, particulates and fluids from MVs may be episodic, scattering from bubbles and particulates may be important for this particular MV at other times ͑perhaps associated with regional seismic events͒ and for other MVs in general. A simple visco-elastic model predicts reasonable first-order dependencies of the scattering as a function of frequency and vertical bistatic angle. With multibeam coverage over a larger area, we plan to develop a statistical clutter model based on the initial simple model developed here. The short-range scattering measurement technique itself may be of importance to the community inasmuch as it is a fairly general way to probe small-scale features, dimensions of O͑10-100͒ m. The key advantages of the technique ͑as compared to long-range techniques͒ are that: ͑a͒ the uncertainties associated with propagation through a generally sparsely sampled ocean are minimized, and ͑b͒ the proximity to the feature allows measurement geometries and concomitant analysis that can directly test hypotheses about the scattering mechanisms. One potential challenge with a vertical array ͑insonification is over 2͒ is that the feature of interest must have a large scattering cross section compared to the background sediment. However, in practice, this is not expected to be a serious limitation since interest in clutter is focused on those features that have a high scattering cross section. Future work will focus on the interpretation of longrange scattering from this same mud volcano. The observation that the scattering is nearly isotropic in the vertical plane should simplify that analysis inasmuch as the simple metric target strength can be employed.",Charles Holland,2006,17225386,10.1121/1.2357707

7097552,Anaerobic oxidation of methane in hypersaline cold seep sediments,"Life in hypersaline environments is typically limited by bioenergetic constraints. Microbial activity at the thermodynamic edge, such as the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulphate reduction (SR), is thus unlikely to thrive in these environments. In this study, carbon and sulphur cycling was investigated in the extremely hypersaline cold seep sediments of Mercator mud volcano. AOM activity was partially inhibited but still present at salinity levels of 292 g L(-1) (c. eightfold sea water concentration) with rates of 2.3 nmol cm(-3) day(-1) and was even detectable under saturated conditions. Methane and evaporite-derived sulphate comigrated in the ascending geofluids, which, in combination with a partial activity inhibition, resulted in AOM activity being spread over unusually wide depth intervals. Up to 79% of total cells in the AOM zone were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as anaerobic methanotrophs of the ANME-1. Most ANME-1 cells formed monospecific chains without any attached partner. At all sites, AOM activity co-occurred with SR activity and sometimes significantly exceeded it. Possible causes of these unexpected results are discussed. This study demonstrates that in spite of a very low energy yield of AOM, microorganisms carrying this reaction can thrive in salinity up to halite saturation.","Marine mud volcanoes (MV) are formed by the extrusion of fluidized sediments of deep origin to the sea floor (Milkov, 2000; Dimitrov, 2002; Kopf, 2002; Niemann & Boetius, 2010) . Erupted material (mud breccia) often contains high amounts of methane and occasionally higher hydrocarbons (Kopf, 2002 and reference therein). The migration of hydrocarbons towards the sediment surface typically fuels a great variety of microorganisms and symbiotic fauna that harvest energy from these reduced molecules, directly or indirectly, using sea water electron acceptors (e.g. O 2 , NO À 3 , SO 2À 4 ). Hydrocarbon seepage therefore promotes the development of thriving cold seep ecosystems, which support high standing stocks of freeliving and symbiotic chemosynthetic microorganisms. One of the most important processes at cold seeps is the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to sulphate reduction (SR; Knittel & Boetius, 2009 and references therein): On a global scale, this reaction oxidizes more than 80% of uprising CH 4 in the sea floor (Reeburgh, 2007 and references therein) . AOM is performed by three groups of Euryarchaeota related to methanogens: ANME-1, ANME-2 and ANME-3 (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001 Orphan et al., , 2002 Knittel et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006b) . These anaerobic methanotrophs often form consortia with sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) of the genera Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) or Desulfobulbus (Knittel MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY et al., 2003; Losekann et al., 2007) . On the basis of these observations, a syntrophic relationship between these microorganisms has been postulated (Boetius et al., 2000; Orphan et al., 2001) with an up to now unidentified interspecies transfer agent mediating electron transfer from methane-oxidizing ANME cells to their sulphatereducing partners. The typical geochemical signature of AOM activity in marine sediments is the presence of a so-called sulphatemethane transition zone (SMTZ), that is, opposed gradients of downward diffusing sulphate and upward migrating methane (Reeburgh, 2007 and references therein) . Microorganisms mediating AOM are usually present and active in a narrow depth interval at the interface between these gradients (Knittel & Boetius, 2009 and references therein). In addition to this sulphate-dependent mode, AOM may also be coupled to the reduction of oxidized metal species, such as Fe(III) and Mn(IV) (Beal et al., 2009) , and N species (Raghoebarsing et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2009; Ettwig et al., 2010) . So far, evidence for an environmental significance of these pathways, particularly in marine environments, is missing. On the basis of an inventory of known metabolisms able to thrive in hypersaline environments, it has been proposed that the upper limit of salt concentration at which energy conservation can occur 'primarily depends on bioenergetic constraints' and secondly on the 'mode of osmotic adaptation used' (Oren, 1999 (Oren, , 2011 . Balancing cell osmotic pressure by active ion pumping or the production of compatible solutes is indeed energetically costly and apparently excludes dissimilatory pathways characterized by low energy yields. From an energetic standpoint, it is thus surprising that a few studies could detect AOM in hypersaline environments (Oren, 2011 and references therein) . Yet, the influence of salinity on AOM activity and microbial community composition is not well constrained. One study, for instance, found geochemical and molecular evidence for AOM activity mediated by ANME-1/SRB in hypersaline sediment of the Gulf of Mexico (Lloyd et al., 2006) , while a recent study on a deep-sea brine pool and a MV, in contrast, suggested that presence of hydrogen prevented AOM activity in spite of the presence of both methane and sulphate . Circumstantial evidence indicates a dominance of ANME-1 over the other ANME groups in hypersaline settings, thus suggesting that this clade might be more tolerant to high salinity (Daffonchio et al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2006; Yakimov et al., 2007; Niederberger et al., 2010; La Cono et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, significant ANME-1 populations are also found in nonhypersaline methane seeps, for example, in the Eel River Basin (off California), the Black Sea microbial mats, the Hydrate Ridge (off Oregon) or the North Sea Tommeliten seeps (Supporting information, Data S1; Orphan et al., 2002; Knittel et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2005; Treude et al., 2005) . Recently, a hypersaline mud volcano (Mercator MV) that bears large amounts of methane was discovered in the Gulf of Cadiz, East Atlantic Nuzzo et al., 2009; Scholz et al., 2009; Perez-Garcia et al., 2011) . This provides a very good opportunity to study the microbial ecology of methane and sulphur cycling in a deep-sea hypersaline environment. Here, we document for the first time the microbial activity and community structure in relation to geochemical settings at Mercator MV, with the aim to understand the functioning of AOM communities under extreme hypersaline conditions. Our results are compared with those from Captain Arutyunov MV (CAMV), a nonhypersaline MV in the vicinity of the Mercator MV.  Gravity or piston corer, and mega corer (GC, PC and MC, respectively) were deployed at each of the Mercator MV sites. Sediment recovery largely varied between cores, probably due to the presence of large halite/gypsum crystals, hard grounds in shallow subsurface or dry sediment horizons. Cores with enough sediment recovery for downstream analysis were selected for this study. Upon recovery, GCs and PCs were cut into 1-m sections and stored at 4°C until further processing (< 10 h after recovery). MCs as well as GC and PC core sections were subsampled by extruding sediments from the core using a plunger. Pore water was extracted from 25 mL sediment using a pore water press (Reeburgh, 1967) equipped with 0.45-lm pore-size nitrocellulose filters. Pore water was then filtered through 0.1-lm pore-size filters prior to sample storage. For sulphide measurement, 1 mL of pore water was preserved in 500 lL zinc acetate solution (10% w/v). AVS was extracted from sediment sealed in a glass jar by adding 6 N HCl under continuous N 2 flow collected in a 7 mL Zn acetate trap, using the experimental setup described in the study by Kallmeyer et al. (2004) . Concentration of both dissolved and AVS was measured colorimetrically using the methylene blue method (Cline, 1969) . Sulphate, chloride and acetate were measured by ion chromatography as described in the study by Parkes et al. (2007) . Methylated amines were analysed using a DX-120 (DIONEX, Camberley, UK) fitted with an IonPac CS16 column coupled with a CSRS 300 4 mm suppressor and a conductivity detector. Separation of pore water constituents was achieved using methanesulphonic acid eluent (25 mM) at a flow rate of 0.75 mL min À1 . Prior to analysis, samples were diluted 1 : 15 (v/v) in ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q) for samples with sea water levels of chloride and 1 : 159 (v/v) for sample with higher chloride concentrations. Maximum concentration observed in pore water samples from both MV was far below the accurate detection limit of the method (c. 400 lM as determined empirically). The highest methylamine concentration was about 5 lM, indicating the most probable detection limit of the method. This value was taken as an upper limit for pore water methylamine pool and used to calculate maximum potential methylamine MG (see ex situ rate measurement below). Dissolved gas in pore water was analysed on shore according to the study by Parkes et al. (2007) : 2 cm 3 of sediment (sampled with a 5 mL cut-off syringe) was transferred into a glass vial containing 6 mL NaOH (2.5%, w/v), which was then immediately sealed with a butyl rubber septum and stored upside down. The headspace was analysed for H 2 , CH 4 and higher volatile hydrocarbons with a modified two channels Perkin Elmer/Arnel 2101 natural gas analyser. Channel A was equipped with three columns (1/8″SF*2.5′ 30% DC-200 on Chromosorb PAW80/100, 1/8″SF*30′ 30%DC-200 on Chromosorb PAW 80/100 and 1/8″SF*6′ ASAG 60/80, respectively) and with both a thermal conductivity and a flame ionization detector (TCD and FID). FID was operated at 45 mL min À1 hydrogen and 450 mL min À1 air. Channel B was also equipped with three columns (1/8″SF*6′Silica Gel 60/80, 1/8″SF*4′HayeSep T 60/80 and 1/8″SF*9′Molecular Sieve 5A 45/60) and a TCD. The system was run under isothermal conditions (110°C). Compound assignment and quantification were carried out by direct comparison with known standards (Scott Specialty Gases). Dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (∑CO 2 ) were determined from 1.25-mL samples of pore water, fixed with 20 mL HgCl2 and sealed, without headspace, in a glass vial using the rapid small volume flow injection method of measuring aqueous CO 2 (Hall & Aller, 1992 ) with the gas analyser described above. For AOM and SR rates measurements, cores were subsampled with mini cores (polycarbonate tube, diameter 2.5 cm, length 20 cm) with silicone-sealed side injection ports spaced every 2 cm, or with glass barrels (diameter 1 cm, length 6 cm) with a syringe plunger at one end, and a butyl rubber stopper at the other end as injection port (for details see Treude et al., 2005) . Within 2 h after sampling, methane radiotracer (25 lL of aqueous 14 CH 4 solution, 5 KBq) or sulphate radiotracer (5 lL of aqueous 35 SO 2À 4 solution, 60 KBq) was injected through the injection ports, and samples were incubated for 24 h in the dark at in situ bottom water temperature measured during ROV dives (e.g. 13°C for Mercator MV stations and 4°C for CAMV). After incubation, AOM and SR reactions were stopped by transferring the samples into glass flasks containing 25 mL NaOH (2.5% w/v) or 50-mL plastic tubes containing 20 mL zinc acetate solution (20% w/v), respectively. Methane and sulphate turnover was determined as described elsewhere (Jørgensen, 1978; Treude et al., 2003; Kallmeyer et al., 2004) . AOM and SR rates were determined as the product of turnover and methane or sulphate concentration, respectively. For AOM rates, methane concentration was corrected for maximum solubility at ambient pressure during incubations (i.e. 1 bar) and in situ salinity (Duan & Mao, 2006) . Rates of MG were measured as described in the study by Parkes et al. (2007) . Briefly, sediment was subsampled using either mini cores (diameter 1.5 cm, length 10 cm) with silicone-filled side injection holes (4 lL substrate per 1 cm depth interval) or 10-mL cut-off syringes closed with rubber stoppers (7.5 lL substrate per syringe). The samples were preincubated for 24 h in nitrogen-flushed gas-tight bags to allow methane concentration equilibration prior to radiotracer injection. 14 C-labelled carbonate (10 KBq lL À1 ), acetate (6 KBq lL À1 ), methanol (2.05 KBq lL À1 ) or methylamine (7.25 KBq lL À1 ) were injected, and samples were incubated at in situ bottom water temperature for 7-21 h in nitrogen-flushed gas-tight bags. Microbial reactions were then stopped by transferring incubations into glass jars containing 7 mL of 1 M NaOH. In the laboratory, 14 C methane was determined as for AOM. Substrate turnover was determined according to the radioactivity of the trapped CO 2 and the amount of added label in the product pool. Rates were calculated as the product of turnover values times total CO 2 or acetate concentrations. For methylamine MG, rates were obtained by multiplying the substrate turnover value by an arbitrary methylamine concentration of 5 lM (as methylamine concentration in pore water was consistently below detection limit). Me-MG rates should thus be considered as maximum potential rates rather than actual ex situ rates. At Mercator Rim 1 (32-33 cmbsf depth interval), environmental DNA was extracted from five replicates sediment sample, each of 0.3 g sediment, using the PowerSoil DNA extraction Kit (MoBio Labconsult, Brussels, Belgium) according to manufacturer recommendations. 16S rRNA genes were amplified using Arch20f/Uni1392r primer pair for Archaea (Kane et al., 1993; Massana et al., 1997) and GM3f/GM4r primer pair for Bacteria (Muyzer et al., 1995) . PCR conditions were as in the study by Losekann et al. (2007) . PCR were carried out in triplicate, amplicons were pooled and purified (PCR purification kit, Qiagen). Purified PCR products were ligated in the PCR-2.1 vector and cloned into Top10 chemocompetent cells using TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium). The size of the insert was verified with a colony PCR on overnight grown positive transformants using M13 vector-specific primer pair (Invitrogen). M13 PCR amplicons were used for ARDRA of the libraries with AluI and RsaI (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Digested DNA was run on a 3% agarose gel, and images were analysed with the BIONUMERICS software (Bionumerics, Kortrijk, Belgium). Clones were clustered according to restriction pattern using the Jaccard similarity index, and when a cluster contained multiple clones, at least two representative clones were sequenced. Bidirectional sequencing was carried on ABI-3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystem, Lennik, Belgium) at the Genetic Service Unit of the Ghent University Hospital using M13 vector primers. Sequences from this study are published in GenBank under the accession numbers FJ813536, FJ813545-FJ813556, FJ813561-FJ813564, FJ813569, FJ813573, FJ813576, FJ813591, FN820294, FN820296, FN820299, FN820302, FN820303, FN820307, FN820308, FN820310, FN820311, FN820312, FN820317, FN820319, FN820320-FN820327, FN820331-FN820335, FN820338, FN820355, FN820359, FN820367, FN820370, FN820372, FN820375, FN820376, FN820377, FN820381, FN820382, FN820384, FN820385, FN820386, FN820390, FN820402-FN820411, FJ813544. All sequences were aligned with the online SINA webaligner of SILVA (Pruesse et al., 2007) ; http://www.arb-silva.de ) and imported together with nearly full length (> 1200 bp for bacterial sequences and > 900 bp for archaeal sequences) closely related 16S rRNA gene sequences in the ARB SILVA database release 102. Sequences were further clustered by OTU (98% similarity cutoff) with the MOTHUR software (Schloss et al., 2009) . Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood-based PhyML algorithm (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/; Guindon et al., 2009 ), filtering out most variable positions of the alignment (50% cut-off). Bootstrap values associated with tree nodes were calculated using the aLRT method (Anisimova & Gascuel, 2006) . Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) cell staining and microscopic observations On board, 2 cm 3 of sediment was fixed by resuspending with 3 mL of filter-sterilized (0.2 lm) formaldehyde in sea water solution (3% v/v final concentration) for 4 h at 4°C. Samples were then washed three times with 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and resuspended in 1 : 1 v/v PBS/ethanol solution and stored at -20°C. FISH and CARD-FISH procedures were carried out according to the study by Pernthaler et al. (2001 Pernthaler et al. ( , 2002 . For CARD-FISH, the following modifications were applied: for permeabilization of rigid archaeal cell walls, 15 lg mL À1 proteinase K was used (3 min at room temperature); for bacterial cell wall permeabilization, 10 mg mL À1 lysozyme (15 min at 37°C). Horseradishperoxidase-(CARD-FISH) or Cy3-labelled (FISH) probes targeting the following groups were used: probes Eub338 I-III (Daims et al., 1999) specific for most bacteria (35% formamide in hybridization buffer or FA), probe Arch915 (Stahl & Amann, 1991) specific for most Archaea (35% FA), probe ANME1-350 (Boetius et al., 2000) specific for ANME-1 (40% FA), probe EelMS-932 (Boetius et al., 2000) specific for ANME-2 (40% FA), probe ANME-3-1249 with unlabelled helper oligonucleotides ANME3-1243 and 1249 h (Losekann et al., 2007) specific for ANME-3 (40% FA) and probe DSS658 (Manz et al., 1998) specific for the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus branch of Deltaproteobacteria (60% FA), including Seep-SRB subgroups. Cells were counterstained with 1 lg mL À1 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. Hybridized cells were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Axioplan, Jena, Germany). For each sample and probe, 50 independent microscopic fields of view were counted, corresponding to approximately 400-800 DAPI-stained cells, and the fraction of double-stained cells has been determined.  The Mercator MV was located at 350 m water depth in the Gulf of Cadiz, at c. 50 km off Morocco (Fig. 1a ). Concentric rims visible on the high-resolution bathymetric map were interpreted as successive eruptive events and permitted to estimate the position of the physical crater centre where the most recently expelled mud and highest fluid flux were expected, as well as at three rim sites ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). At Mercator MV Crater Centre site, gas was venting from the seafloor, and large halite (NaCl) and gypsum (CaSO 4 ) crystals were recovered from the sediments between 150 and 200 cm below the sea floor (cmbsf). CAMV was sampled in the crater centre site. For comparison with non-MV sediments, a reference station was sampled 2.4 km NE of Mercator MV. Details of the high-resolution bathymetry method, sampling sites description and coring devices are given in Data S1. As Na + and Cl À are the major brine-derived ions present in the pore water of Mercator MV (Scholz et al., 2009) and CAMV (Hensen et al., 2007) ; the salinity in these sediments was estimated by the chloride concentration ( Fig. 2) . At the Mercator MV Crater Centre (cores JC10-09 and -19), chloride concentration at 10 cmbsf was already 3.5-fold (2011 mM) higher than sea water values and further increased with depth along concave up gradients, up to halite saturation level (c. 5800 mM) at 220 cmbsf. At the rim stations (cores JC10-11, -13 and -15), chloride concentration formed a quasi-linear gradient with depth from sea water concentration (c. 580 mM) at the surface up to 3213 mM at 67.5 cmbsf. Both at the reference station (cores JC10-02 and -04) and at CAMV Crater Centre stations (core JC10-66), chloride concentration reflected sea water concentration at the sediment surface and remained constant with depth. On the basis of these different salinity profiles, three methane-rich habitats with decreasing salt contents (chlorinity gradients) were selected for further detailed studies on geochemistry and microbial activity: (1)  At all three locations, an upward migration of methane in the sediment was indicated by elevated methane concentrations in deeper section of the cores, generally decreasing towards surface (Fig. 3 ). These results are in agreement with previous publications on the geochemistry of the chosen structures (e.g. Van Rooij et al., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006a; Hensen et al., 2007; Nuzzo et al., 2009; Scholz et al., 2009) . At Mercator MV Crater Centre, methane concentration decreased from 3 mM at 75 cmbsf to 0.6 mM at the sediment surface. At Mercator MV Rim 1, the methane decreased from 0.23 mM at 21 cmbsf to 5.10 À3 mM at 11.5 cmbsf, and similar trend was observed at Mercator MV Rim 2. At CAMV Crater Centre, methane concentration steeply decreased from 1.2 mM at 26.5 cmbsf to near background concentrations at 21.5 cmbsf, and methane was depleted in the upper 20 cm of the core. Sulphate concentration was close to sea water values at the sediment surface (28-30 mM) in all cores (Fig. 3) . At Mercator MV, sulphate first decreased with depth down to 13.2 mM at Crater Centre or to 24.4 mM at Rim 2 (at 162 and 42 cmbsf respectively), but then increased again with depth, reaching maximum values of 18.5 and 28.3 mM, respectively. At Mercator MV Rim 1, sulphate concentration remained constant down to 28 cmbsf. At CAMV Crater Centre, sulphate concentration steeply decreased and reached 2.8 mM at 22.5 cmbsf, remained at this level down to 40.5 cmbsf and was below detection limit (c. 0.1 mM), below 55 cmbsf. At all Mercator MV sites, we could not detect any soluble sulphide (H 2 S, HS À , S À 2 ; data not shown), although decreasing sulphate contents and sulphate reduction rates (SSR; see next section) indicated sulphide production. However, at least some of the sulphide could be precipitated because acid volatile sulphide (AVS) content was elevated (0.5 mM of sediment) at Mercator MV Rim 2 (32 cmbsf; data not shown). In contrast, at CAMV Crater Centre, we could detect substantial amounts of (dissolved) sulphide peaking with 3.2 mM at 22.5 cmbsf (Fig. 3d) , that is, at the interface between the methane and sulphate gradients. Acetate was present in the pore water of all sites ( Fig. 3 ) with decreasing concentrations from the deeper layers (between c. 40 lM at Mercator Rim sites to c. 90 lM at Mercator Crater Centre) towards the surface (5-20 lM). At CAMV Crater Centre, a peak of acetate (107 lM) occurred at 40 cmbsf. Substantial amounts of dissolved hydrogen, mostly as discrete concentration peaks, could be detected in all four cores (Fig. 3) . Maximum hydrogen concentration ranged from 0.7 nM at Mercator Crater Rim 2 to 4.4 nM at Mercator Crater Centre. These values probably represent low estimates owing to sediment degassing during recovery. Anaerobic oxidation of methane Significant rates of AOM (AOMR) were detected in all habitats investigated in this study (Fig. 3) . At Mercator MV Crater Centre (Fig. 3a) , AOM activity was present throughout the entire core, with two zones of apparently higher activity: in the first 50 cm below the surface, with a maximum AOMR of 6 nmol cm À3 day À1 at 21 cmbsf, and at greater depth (170 cmbsf) with a maximum AOMR of 2.3 nmol cm À3 day À1 . Notably, both maxima coincided with a decrease in methane concentrations (Fig. 3) . At Mercator MV Rim 1 and Rim 2 ( Fig. 3b and  c) , AOM activity was present in near-surface sediments with rates of 0.8 and 2 nmol cm À3 day À1 , respectively, and decreased with depth to values close or below detection limit. At 25 cmbsf, AOMR increased, and two activity peaks of 3.0 and 3.6 nmol cm À3 day À1 were detected between 30 and 40 cmbsf at Rim 1, and a single peak of 8.5 nmol cm À3 day À1 at Rim 2. At the latter, AOM activity extended down to the bottom of the core, with rates between 1 and 1.7 nmol cm À3 day À1 . At CAMV Crater (Fig. 3d) , a distinct peak of AOM activity (11.4 nmol cm À3 day À1 ) was found between 28 and 31 cmbsf, which vertically coincided with the sulphide peak and the depth of the sulphate-methane transition. AOM was close to the detection limit above this active zone. As already observed by Niemann et al. (2006a) , weak AOMR (0.5-1.3 nmol cm À3 day À1 ) were detected below the SMTZ between 47 and 297 cmbsf. At Mercator Crater Centre (Fig. 3a) , SRR showed three maxima: immediately below the surface (SRR of 5.58 nmol cm À3 day À1 at 5 cmbsf), at 56 cm (2.36 nmol cm À3 day À1 ) and at 220 cmbsf (7.47 nmol cm À3 day À1 ). At Mercator MV Rim 1 (Fig. 3b ), SR was scattered over depth, but showed a general increase towards 30 cmbsf, broadly corresponding to depth of the two AOM maxima. At Mercator MV Rim 2 (Fig. 3c) , SR was maximal just beneath the sediment surface (9.6 nmol cm À3 day À1 ) and showed a second lower maximum of 1.83 nmol cm À3 day À1 at the same depth (31 cmbsf) where also the AOM maximum was found. At CAMV Crater Centre, in contrast to the rather weak coupling between AOM-SR found at Mercator MV, SR peaked (24.13 nmol cm À3 day À1 ) just in the same sediment horizon (28-31 cmbsf) where also AOM was maximal. Depth integrated AOM rates (∑AOMR) and SR rates (∑SRR) were comprised between 147 and 898 mmol m À2 year À1 , and 326 and 1803 mmol m À2 year À1 , respec-tively (Table 2) . Remarkably, AOMR exceeded SRR in several sediments intervals. This difference was significant (i.e. no overlap of 95% confidence intervals) at Mercator MV Rim 2 (37.5 cmbsf) and in most sediment horizons between 7 and 29 cmbsf at Mercator MV Crater Centre. As a consequence, ∑AOMR exceeded ∑SRR by a factor 2.8 at Rim 2 in the 27-77 cmbsf interval, 1.23 over the entire core (Table 2) , and 2.2 at Crater Centre between 7 and 49 cmbsf. With the exception of Mercator MV Crater Centre, methanogenesis (MG) using different substrates could be detected in all cores, albeit at very low rates and at discrete depth horizons. No methanol MG was observed in any of the sites investigated. Generally, we found a vertical succession of methylotrophic (Meth-MG) with methylamine as a substrate in the shallowest horizons, followed by acetotrophic (Ac) and then by hydrogenotrophic (H) MG. At Mercator MV Rim 1 (Fig. 3b) , Meth-MG peaked with 8.1 pmol cm À3 day À1 at 3 cmbsf, Ac-MG with 2.3 pmol cm À3 day À1 at 13 cmbsf and H-MG with 50.5 pmol cm À3 day À1 at 17 cmbsf. At Rim 2 (Fig. 3c ), a peak of Meth-MG was also present near sediment surface, but we could not detect H-MG or Ac-MG. Similarly, at CAMV Crater Centre, H-MG was absent, but we found two peaks of Ac-MG at 55 and 300 cmbsf (c. 0.13 pmol cm À3 day À1 ) and a near-surface peak in Meth-MG ( Fig. 3d) . Table 2 . Areal microbial activity rates. Areal rates ∑SRR and ∑AOMR were obtained by integrating volumetric AOMR and SRR over the entire core (total) or the over the SMTZ. The AOM contribution to SR over the entire core (resp. over the SMTZ) is given by the ratios ∑AOMR (total)/ ∑SRR (total) [resp. ∑AOMR (total)/∑SRR (SMTZ)]. In the absence of an SMTZ in Mercator MV sediments, the latter ratio does not apply to these sites Station Flux (  The structure of the microbial community involved in AOM in hypersaline sediments of Mercator MV Rim 1 was investigated by constructing both archaeal (85 clones) and bacterial (75 clones) 16S rRNA gene libraries with DNA extracted in the 32-33 cmbsf interval where AOM was maximum. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) of these clones resulted in 17 archaeal and 47 bacterial groups displaying different restriction patterns for which at least two representative clones were sequenced. These sequences clustered into 4 and 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. Nonparametric Chao 1 richness estimators (8) were of 7 and 33, thus resulting in library richness coverage of 57% for the archaeal library and of 67% for the bacterial library. Rarefaction curves computed with the MOTHUR software (Schloss et al., 2009 ) indicated that the Archaeal diversity was extensively covered by the library, whereas bacterial curve did not reach a plateau (see Data S1). Sequences belonging to the ANME-1b clade (Hinrichs et al., 1999) largely dominated the archaeal library (n = 69/85, Fig. 4) , followed by sequences belonging to the GoM-Arc1 clade (n = 14/85; Lloyd et al., 2006) ; also called ANME-2d by Mills et al. (2003 Mills et al. ( , 2004 . Most bacterial sequences were affiliated with SRB belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria (n = 50/75, Fig. 5 ). Of these, sequences belonging to the Seep-SRB1 cluster constituted the largest fraction (n = 39/75) of the bacterial diversity, falling in the Seep-SRB1-c (n = 30/75), Seep-SRB1-d (n = 7/75) and Seep-SRB1-a (n = 2/75), the putative syntrophic ANME partners subgroups (Schreiber et al., 2010) . In addition, sequences falling within the families Anaerolineacea (n = 1/75) and Fig. 4 . Affiliation of Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from Mercator MV Rim 1 (32-33 cmbsf). The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on a subset of 351 sequences using the maximum likelihood method (PhyML, Guindon et al., 2009) filtering out positions according to base frequencies among Archaea (50% cutoff). Percentages indicate branch support as calculated by the aLRT bootstrapping method (Anisimova & Gascuel, 2006; Guindon et al., 2009) . 1 (32-33 cmbsf) . The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on a subset of 195 sequences using the maximum likelihood method (PhyML, Guindon et al., 2009) filtering out positions according to base frequencies among Deltaproteobacteria (50% cutoff). Percentages indicate branch support as calculated by the aLRT bootstrapping method (Anisimova & Gascuel, 2006; Guindon et al., 2009 Spirochetacea (n = 1/75) were present in the library. The remaining bacterial phylotypes were mostly affiliated with candidate phyla with no cultivated representatives, such as candidate divisions OP8 (n = 11/75), OP9 (n = 1/75), WS3 (n = 1/75) and TA06 (n = 6/75). The in situ abundance and distribution of putative archaeal anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME-1, -2 and -3) were further investigated in the three Mercator MV cores applying CARD-FISH or FISH at CAMV Crater Centre. Confirming the results of the archaeal clone library, ANME-1 was the only group of known methanotrophs detected at Mercator MV. Members of this clade were found at several depth intervals. At Mercator MV Rim 1, ANME-1 cells were dominant at 29 cmbsf, accounting for 79 ± 0.8% of the DAPI-stained cells (Fig. 3c ). At the same depth, 75% of the DAPI-stained cells belonged to the domain Archaea, indicating that most likely all of these were ANME-1 cells (results not shown). In general, ANME-1 cells were rodshaped, formed chains of 2-16 cells ( Fig. 6a and b) and were not associated with other type of cells. Less than 10% of ANME-1 cells were involved in large aggregates ( Fig. 6c  and d) comprising few non-ANME-1 coccoid cells. Bacteria accounted for 21% of DAPI-stained cells, of which 53% (i.e. 11% of the total cell number) belonged to the DSS group, which includes the Seep-SRB cluster of putative ANME partners. However, no direct cell-cell contact of DSS cells and ANME-1 was observed. At Mercator MV Rim 2, ANME-1 cells were only observed at 42.5 cmbsf and constituted 58 ± 10% of the DAPI-stained cells (Fig. 3c ). There, cells were smaller (c. 0.7 lm), with coccoid or short rod shapes, and found as single cells or chains of 2-4 cells ( Fig. 6e and f) . Very few DAPI-stained cells were observed at 2, 22 and 42 cmbsf. None of these cells showed a positive signal for any of the ANME probes. Below 50 cmbsf, almost no DAPI-stained cells could be observed, and no ANME-1 cells were detected in the Mercator MV Crater Centre at the investigated depths. In contrast, in the AOM zone (30 cmbsf) of the CAMV Crater Centre, the presence of ANME-2 cells (previously found in the study by Niemann et al. (2006a) was confirmed by FISH assays. There, ANME-2 cells occurred as shell-type aggregates, surrounded by other non-ANME cells (Fig. 6g and h ).   Hypersaline milieus are typically considered as hostile or even biogeochemical dead ends. Although the immense ionic strength and osmotic pressure appear to exclude most life on Earth, some specialized microorganisms and a few Eukarya have adapted to minimize the negative effects of hypersalinity. This allowed them to thrive in these extremely challenging environments (Boetius & Joye, 2009 ). Because of the many biochemical constraints associated with life in hypersalinity, these environments are believed to select for metabolisms associated with elevated energy yield. In contrast, AOM is characterized by one of the lowest known energy yields among microbial energy conserving reactions. In the particular case of the putative syntrophic nature of AOM, the energy is shared, which further reduces the energy yield for each syntrophic partner. Despite these constraints, previous studies have shown that AOM can occur in hypersaline environments such as Mono- (Joye et al., 1999) and Big Soda lake (Iversen et al., 1987) at salinity of 88-90 g L À1 (c. 1.6 M Cl À ). In marine cold seep sediments, Lloyd et al. (2006) provided geochemical and molecular evidence for AOM activity at 146 g L À1 (c. 2.5 M Cl À ). Our results significantly extend the salinity range for AOM, showing that substantial rates (2.3 nmol cm À3 day À1 at Mercator MV Crater Centre) can be attained under extreme hypersaline conditions of 263 g L À1 (4.5 M Cl À ), and even at halite-saturating conditions (340 g L À1 or 5.8 M Cl À ) with rates of 0.5 nmol cm À3 day À1 . Hence, ANME-1 cells detected in extreme hypersaline environments, such as the Bannock, l'Atalante and Thetis deep-sea brine pools, with respective salinities of 148 g L À1 (Daffonchio et al., 2006) , 230 g L À1 (Yakimov et al., 2007) and 348 g L À1 (La Cono et al., 2011) , might well perform AOM. However, these results are in contrast with the current concept that hypersaline conditions select for high-energy yield metabolisms. It is not clear how microbial communities mediating AOM can implement energy demanding osmoregulatory mechanisms (e.g. ion pumping or production of compatible solutes) unless the low AOM energy yield is balanced by a very high methane turnover per cell. At Mercator MV, maximum AOMR were below 8.5 nmol cm 3 day À1 , and even as low as 2.3 nmol cm 3 day À1 in the most hypersaline Crater Centre site. This later value is approximately five times lower than maximum AOMR in nonhypersaline sediments of CAMV (11.4 nmol cm À3 day À1 , this study), and even c. 150 times lower than maximum rates reported in a mud volcano (e.g. 350 nmol cm À3 day À1 under the beggiatoa mat at the Haakon Mosby MV in the Barent Sea; Niemann et al., 2006b) . These results were unexpected because AOM rates amplitude is generally controlled by methane and sulphate availability in sediments (Dale et al., 2008; Knab et al., 2009 ). However, sulphate and methane concentrations were much higher in Mercator MV than in the SMTZ of AOM zones at other cold seep sites (Knittel & Boetius, 2009 and references therein) . The presence of such large sulphate and methane pools would thus have the potential to sustain much higher rates than the one observed in the hypersaline sites. This strongly suggests that AOM was inhibited at the level of cell activity or population growth, probably as a result of the extreme hypersaline conditions at Mercator MV. Further evidence for a salinity-induced inhibition of AOM is given by comparing Mercator MV sites. At Rim 1 and 2 sites where salinity was lower than in the Crater Centre, maximum AOMR were higher in spite of the lower methane concentration. These higher rates resulted in an almost complete consumption of methane below the sediment surface, unlike at the Crater Centre site where methane was not entirely consumed in the sediments. This interpretation of a salinity-induced inhibition of AOM activity is further supported by the results of Nauhaus et al. (2005) showing that AOM rates tend to decrease with increasing salt concentration above sea water salinity during in vitro incubations with seep sediments. AOM inhibition and multiple sulphate sources lead to an unusual microbial activity spatial distribution AOM activity at all Mercator MV sites displayed a much wider vertical distribution than in typical SMTZ where AOM activity is confined to a discrete sediment horizon (Knittel & Boetius, 2009) , as observed in CAMV site with background salinity. Mercator MV hypersaline sediments were characterized by elevated sulphate levels because of the leaching of sulphate-rich evaporites by the ascending fluid (Scholz et al., 2009 ). In this system, sulphate was therefore transported not only downward from sea water into the sediment, but also upward together with other ions, hydrocarbons and geofluids. The multiple sources of sulphate in this original system, combined with the hypersalinity-induced inhibition of AOM that prevents depletion of both sulphate and methane (see above), can thus explain the unusually broad microbial activity distribution. Interestingly, despite higher maximum AOMR at CAMV, depth integrated areal rates (∑AOMR) were 6.1-and 3.8-fold lower than in Mercator MV Crater Centre and Rim 2, respectively (Table 2) . Hence, such vertical extension of AOM activity resulted in higher turnover per unit area and thus compensated to some extent the reduction of volumetric rates. . On the basis of these results and on video observations of gas venting from Mercator MV crater (Van Rooij et al., 2005) , it has been proposed that methane hydrate dissociation could also occur at this site (Van Rooij et al., 2005) . The present study thus provides new insights on the origin of the gas venting from Mercator MV Crater Centre. Our results indeed show that hypersaline conditions, by disrupting the so-called 'methane benthic filter', was the main cause of methane venting in the water column. AOM community structure in hypersaline sediments of Mercator MV The Mercator MV environment closely resembles the Gulf of Mexico gassy sediment described in the study by Lloyd et al. (2006) , in term of hypersalinity and dominance of ANME-1 cells. Therefore, extremely saline environments may well exert a selective pressure towards ANME-1, as already proposed in the study by Lloyd et al. (2006) and Yakimov et al. (2007) . This would also explain the findings of ANME-1 in brines in the Eastern Mediterranean (Daffonchio et al., 2006; Yakimov et al., 2007; La Cono et al., 2011) . As ANME-1 cells have also been reported at the CAMV Crater Centre site (Niemann et al., 2006a) and other nonhypersaline environments (see Data S1 and Knittel & Boetius, 2009 ), a negative selection towards other ANME groups thus appears to be the most probable ANME selection mechanism in hypersaline cold seeps. Such selection pattern could be related to the comparatively low effect of ionic strength on Archaea in general and ANME-1 in particular. The permeability of archaeal membranes comprising isoprenoidal glycerol ethers is generally lower than that of bacterial membranes comprising fatty acid glycerol esters (Valentine, 2007) . Low membrane permeability reduces the energy loss associated with random ion exchange between the cyto-and ectoplasm. Specifically, ANME-1 comprises high contents of membrane-spanning lipids, so-called glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers-GDGTs (Niemann & Elvert, 2008 and references therein). Membranes composed of GDGTs are at the lower end of permeability when comparing typical membrane lipids (Yamauchi et al., 1993; Valentine, 2007) . In contrast, ANME-2 and -3 cell membranes rather contain diethers, that are characterized by higher permeability, and less or no GDGTs (Rossel et al., 2011) . This could thus explain why hypersalinity seems to exclude ANME-2 and ANME-3 but not ANME-1 cells. In addition, genes coding for mannosylglycerate and di-myo-inositol-phosphate synthesis pathways were identified in the ANME-1 genome . These two compatible solutes are widely employed by halophilic microorganisms to increase their turgor pressure (Roberts, 2004; da Costa & Empadinhas, 2008) . These compounds may thus also confer hypersalinity adaptation to the ANME-1 cells. Finally, Stokke et al. (2012) recently unravelled the presence of proteins from ANME-1 involved in rigid gas vesicle synthesis that could constitute a salt stress response. In Mercator MV Rim 1 sediments, ANME-1 cells were mainly present as monospecific chains, with no apparent contact with any other cell type. In addition, the ANME/ DSS ratio was of 7 : 1 (29 cmbsf in Mercator MV Rim 1), strongly differing from the typical 1 : 1 to 1 : 3 ratios observed in shell-type consortia (Boetius et al., 2000; Orcutt & Meile, 2008) . As no other putative anaerobic methanotrophs were detected in Mercator MV sediments, our results suggest that ANME-1 cells at Mercator MV can mediate AOM, even in the absence of ANME-2-or ANME-3-like consortia with SRB (see Data S1 for a short review of ANME-1 organization at other seep sites). However, despite our observations of a few large ANME-1 clusters ( Fig. 6c and d) , the disaggregation of cell assemblage by CARD-FISH preparation cannot be ruled out. At Mercator Crater Centre site, the absence of ANME cells indicates that methane oxidation observed in the first 50 cm was probably not carried out by any known ANME cell type. Below 50 cmbsf, sediments were more hypersaline, and it is possible that cell fixation involving sea water salinity reagents (see Materials and methods) caused osmotic shocks and substantial cell lysis in these samples. This could explain that DAPI-stained cells were rarely observed in these samples despite significant activity rates.  At CAMV Crater Centre, we found that depth of SRR and AOMR maxima coincided, and areal SRR (∑SRR) exceeded areal AOMR (∑AOMR) within the SMTZ. On the basis of these areal rates, 63% of the SR in the AOM zone was because of methane oxidation (Table 2) . This was thus compatible with a coupling between these reactions with an equimolar consumption of both substrates. Several factors can account for the remaining 37% SR activity in the AOM zone: organoclastic SR through mineralization of higher hydrocarbons comigrating with methane (Niemann et al., 2006a; Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Bowles et al., 2011) or sedimentary organic matter from microbial or seep fauna necromass (Niemann et al., 2006a; Hilario & Cunha, 2008; Sommer et al., 2009) . We also found the reverse situation where ∑AOMR consistently exceeded ∑SRR over large depth intervals at Mercator MV Crater Centre or Rim 2 and at CAMV Crater Centre between 43 and 300 cmbsf. These remarkable results suggested the presence of alternative electron acceptors, other than sulphate, in both MV sediments. No nitrate/nitrite was detected in any anion-exchange chromatograms (results not shown), suggesting that N-dependant AOM (Raghoebarsing et al., 2006; Beal et al., 2009; Ettwig et al., 2010) is unlikely involved in methane turnover at this site. The presence of a large pool of Fe is suggested by the presence of significant AVS concentration, at least in Rim1 station. Fe(III) can be present in subseafloor sediments and brines (D'Hondt et al., 2004; Parkes et al., 2005) and has been shown to be responsible of a cryptic sulphur cycle through sulphide reoxidation (Holmkvist, et al., 2011) . Although speculative at present, it therefore seems possible that AOM at Mercator MV partially rely on other electron acceptors than sulphate. At CAMV, the intrusion of sea water within the ascending fluid (Hensen et al., 2007) could be the source of such electron acceptors. Interestingly, similar decoupling of AOM and SR was already observed in conditions of very low or no sulphate, either in vitro (Hansen et al., 1998; Beal et al., 2011) or in environmental samples, at the base of or below SMTZs (Hansen et al., 1998; Joye et al., 2004; Niemann et al., 2006a; Parkes et al., 2007) , which apparently correspond to the preferential habitat for ANME-1 cells in nonhypersaline methane-bearing marine sediments Yanagawa et al., 2011) . These observations suggest that ANME-1-dominated AOM communities could potentially decouple AOM and SR, as observed in the present study. Populations of ANME cells can have a dual methanotrophic-methanogenic activity, as evidenced by environmental surveys (Orcutt et al., 2005) or in vitro incubations (Treude et al., 2007; Orcutt & Meile, 2008) . In both MV of this study, zones of methanogenic activity did not overlap with methanotrophic activity. Hence, MG rates measured here are rather attributed to 'true' MG instead of methanotrophic 'coreaction'. In any cases, MG activity was too low and within too narrow sediment intervals to significantly contribute to the methane pool at all investigated sites. In the presence of sulphate, SRB generally outcompete methanogens for the utilization of H 2 or acetate Schonheit et al., 1982) . In line with this general rule was the presence of Ac-MG rates only below the SMTZ at CAMV Crater Centre, where sulphate was depleted. However, peaks of Ac-MG and H-MG also occurred in the sulphate zone in Mercator MV Rim 1 sediments, thus departing from such typical zonation. Similar results were reported in the Napoli MV hypersaline sediments of the East Mediterranean sea (Lazar et al., 2011) . In the presence of sulphate, methylotrophic methanogens can still metabolize methyl moieties but mostly redirect them through the reverse MG oxidative pathway, with CO 2 as final product rather than CH 4 (Finke et al., 2007) . In this case, SR acts as a sink for the electrons released during methyl oxidation via interspecies H 2 transfer. Similar process could occur with acetate as electron donor (Phelps et al., 1985; Achtnich et al., 1995) and could explain the residual Ac-MG rate observed at Mercator MV Rim 1. This interpretation of residual Ac-MG was supported by an important peak of acetate oxidation to CO 2 at 13 cmbsf (7847 pmol cm À3 day À1 , data not shown) compared to the CH 4 formation (2.4 pmol cm À3 day À1 ) at the same depth. The interpretation of the H-MG activity peak was more problematic, as SRB usually maintain H 2 levels that are inhibitory for methanogens . The Met-MG activity in sulphate-rich near-surface sediments at all sites excepted Mercator MV Crater Centre was coherent with the fact that methylated amines are noncompetitive substrate that cannot be used by SRB (Oremland & Polcin, 1982) . In brine sediments of Mercator MV, the abundance of both sulphate and methane in the ascending fluid fuels substantial rates of AOM and SR. Unlike in typical methane-bearing sediments, no clear SMTZ is present, and AOM and SR are distributed over wide depth intervals. However, hypersaline conditions partially inhibited AOM such that maximum volumetric rates are orders of magnitude lower in comparison with other cold seeps. At Mercator MV, AOM is mediated by ANME-1, which mostly occurs as monospecific cell chains and constitutes up to four-fifth of the microbial community. This, together with previous findings of ANME-1 in hypersaline settings, suggests that this ANME clade is well adapted to elevated salinity despite the low energy conserved from the AOM reaction. We also found that AOM and SR can be uncou-pled with AOM significantly exceeding SR over wide depth intervals. Hypothetically, this could be related to the utilization of electron acceptors other than sulphate for AOM.",Loïs Maignien,2013,22882187,10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01466.x
17208459,"A chemosynthetic weed: the tubeworm Sclerolinum contortum is a bipolar, cosmopolitan species","Background ::: Sclerolinum (Annelida: Siboglinidae) is a genus of small, wiry deep-sea tubeworms that depend on an endosymbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria for their nutrition, notable for their ability to colonise a multitude of reducing environments. Since the early 2000s, a Sclerolinum population has been known to inhabit sediment-hosted hydrothermal vents within the Bransfield Strait, Southern Ocean, and whilst remaining undescribed, it has been suggested to play an important ecological role in this ecosystem. Here, we show that the Southern Ocean Sclerolinum population is not a new species, but more remarkably in fact belongs to the species S. contortum, first described from an Arctic mud volcano located nearly 16,000 km away.","The vastness and inaccessibility of the deep sea has challenged scientists seeking to understand its diversity [1, 2] . A major area of this research concerns improving knowledge on the ranges of deep-sea species, which has become particularly pertinent in light of growing human impacts in this environment [3] . Molecular tools have been applied to this field and have revealed that certain deep-sea species with widespread distributions can exhibit similar morphology but considerable genetic differentiation between regions, and may thereby represent several closely related but geographically restricted species -so called 'cryptic species' [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Contrastingly, other studies have also revealed that some taxa can indeed be incredibly widespread, displaying distributions that can span both poles, i.e. bipolar. This pattern has been confirmed in bacteria and archaea [9, 10] , in benthic foraminifera [11] , deep-sea coral [12] and a lineage of the amphipod Eurythenes gryllus [8] . While there are problems with the use of molecular data to delimit species, the examination of genetic variation at multiple (both mitochondrial and nuclear) loci within an evolutionary context has become an important addition to our definition of a species alongside morphological, biological and ecological observations [13] [14] [15] , as well as a critical tool in the investigation of species biogeography. Here we investigate the range and ecological adaptations of a deep-sea siboglinid tubeworm over near 16,000 km spanning from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The family Siboglinidae is a monophyletic lineage of annelid worms comprised of the vestimentiferans, or giant tubeworms, the bone-eating genus Osedax, and two groups of slender tubeworms -Sclerolinum and the frenulates [16] . Siboglinidae is exceptional among the annelids due to this family's almost complete reliance on endosymbiotic bacteria for nutrition, and the unusual morphology which its members have adopted for this specialism [17] . The majority of siboglinids (except for Osedax and a number of frenulates capable of oxidising methane) harbour sulphur-oxidising symbionts [18] and are characteristically long, often acting like a 'bridge' between a sulphidic substrate where their posterior end is located, and oxygenated seawater into which they extend their anterior end [19] . Although siboglinids are found within all of the world's major oceans, the distribution and genetic structure of certain lineages is poorly constrained. Hydrothermal vent vestimentiferans endemic to the East Pacific Rise (EPR) are perhaps the best studied, where species such as Riftia pachyptila and Tevnia jerichonana show extensive ranges along the length of this mid ocean ridge system, while the degree of genetic differentiation between populations increases with distance [20, 21] . Vestimentiferans that can colonise seeps, whale and wood falls have the potential to be even more widely distributed. The genus Escarpia is found in a variety of reducing environments, and occupies several ocean basins with the three described species Escarpia laminata, E. southwardae, and E. spicata occurring in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), West Africa, and in the eastern Pacific respectively. However, while there is high genetic similarity between the three species, geographical and hydrological barriers still appear to limit gene flow between them [22] . The genus Sclerolinum, which forms the sister clade to the vestimentiferans [23] , also exhibits a widespread distribution. The seven formally described species are reported from the northeast Atlantic [24, 25] , GoM and Caribbean [26, 27] , and southeast Asia [28, 29] , however there are also a number of known but not currently described Sclerolinum populations from Antarctica, Hawaii [30] , the Sea of Okhotsk [31] and off Kushiro, Japan [32, 33] , that extend the range of this genus even further. This little studied genus of small, wiry tubeworms have also been found to possesses peculiar organisation that has made it challenging to determine its position in relation to other siboglinids, have been shown to perform important ecological functions within deep-sea sediments, and is capable of colonising a multitude of reducing environments [25-27, 29, 30, 34] . Remarkable substrate choice and geographical range is demonstrated by just one Sclerolinum species, S. contortum. Initially described from soft sediments at Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) [25] , this species was later also found to be residing in the nearby cold seeps of the Storegga Slide, Norwegian Sea [35, 36] as well as in diffuse flow areas of the Arctic vents of Loki's Castle [37, 38] . Colonisation experiments in the northeast Atlantic have shown that in addition to soft sediments, S. contortum can inhabit wood, other decaying plant debris, as well as mineral substrates [39] . A population of Sclerolinum contortum notably also occurs within the cold seeps of the GoM, a distance of over 7600 km from the nearest northeast Atlantic population [27] . Considerable sampling of the deep waters around Antarctica in recent years has revealed this region to be much more diverse, and not as isolated as traditionally thought [40] . These exploration efforts have also shown that the Southern Ocean possesses a variety of deep-sea chemosynthetic habitats that include areas of high temperature and diffuse venting, cold seeps, and whale falls [41] [42] [43] [44] . Hydrothermal activity is currently known to occur within the Bransfield Strait [41, 45] , along the East Scotia Ridge [46] , Pacific-Antarctic Ridge [47] , Australian-Antarctic Ridge [48] , and within Kemp Caldera [49] , and to support unique vent ecosystems distinct from those of the main mid-ocean ridge systems [43] . Since 2001, Sclerolinum has been known to inhabit the sedimented hydrothermal vents of Hook Ridge, Bransfield Strait (Fig. 1) [41] . This population was recently suggested to play an important role in mediating the release of iron and manganese from sediments to the water column [34] . However while aspects of the habitat and function of this population have been investigated [30, 34] , the morphology of these worms, their extent within the Southern Ocean, and how this population relates to other known Sclerolinum populations remain unknown. This study aims to provide a detailed description of the Antarctic Sclerolinum population, place it within a phylogenetic context and thereby establish its relationships to other Sclerolinum populations worldwide, and discern its extent and ecology within the Southern Ocean.    Anterior extremity of tubes pale white in colour, thin walled (2 to 7 μm) and flattened. Posteriorly, wall thickness increases (to maximum of 28 μm) and tubes generally exhibit several smooth bends (Fig. 2a) . Majority of tube is pale brown/green in colour (Fig. 2a-b) , flexible and elastic, often possessing closely but irregularly spaced transverse wrinkles as well as faint longitudinal wrinkles on its outer surface (Fig. 3a) , occasional microbial filament and rust patches are also present on outer tube surfaces. Tube walls are multi-layered, comprised of superimposed fibrous sheets in which fibres show an overall disorganised arrangement, inner tube surface shows a similar texture (Fig. 3c-d) . Towards posterior extremity, tubes are increasingly thin walled and collapsed, outer tube wall generally smooth but with patches of attached sediment grains (Fig. 3b) . Tube diameter ranges from 0.22 to 0.30 mm, longest tube fragment measured 155 mm. Several tubes exhibit branch-like abnormalities (Fig. 2e) , a subset of Hook Ridge Site 1 tubes were very dark brown to black in colour (similar to tubes from Kemp Caldera, see later (Fig. 6b) ). , as well as the path traversed by the SHRIMP (in blue). Map created using GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org) using data from the Global Multi-Resolution Topography (GMRT) Synthesis [92] Longest animal measured 52 mm in length (from tip of the cephalic lobe) but all were incomplete with posterior extremity missing, therefore opisthosomal characters could not be elucidated. Animals are bright red when alive, this colouration being most pronounced in trunk tissues (Fig. 3e-f ). Two tentacles (Fig. 2c) often slightly different in length in individuals, tentacle lengths overall varied greatly between measured worms, from 0.83 to 3.00 mm. Tentacles smooth or occasionally wrinkled on inner surfaces, longitudinal blood vessels visible within them (Fig. 4a-b) . Dense epidermal glands occur around the base of tentacles, which are more scattered distally (Fig. 4a-b) . Diameter of forepart ranges between 0.15 to 0.23 mm. Cephalic lobe had a small, rounded triangular tip 55 to 75 μm in length that protrudes from forepart (Figs. 3h and 4b ). Dorsal furrow deep and wide, extending from base of tentacles (Figs. 3i and 4a). Frenulum positioned 0.13 to 0.37 μm from tip of cephalic lobe. Region surrounding frenulum shows dense covering of glands, present on both dorsal and ventral surfaces. Frenulum comprised of 9-19 oval to elongated plaques measuring 14 to 46 μm in diameter (Fig. 3j) , occurring as a slightly sparse or dense row. Frenular plaques occur dorsolaterally and ventrally with middle ventral plaque often missing, plaques in middle ventral and middle dorsal areas often smaller (Figs. 3h-i and 4a-b). Densely ciliated band present posterior to frenulum on ventral side of animal, that widens with increasing distance from frenulum (Figs. 3h, k and 4b). Region posterior to frenulum and around the ciliated band contains scattered glands, visible as slits in SEM images (Fig. 3i) . Transition between ending of dorsal furrow and beginning of a narrower, highly wrinkled and densely papillated trunk region clearly distinguished anterior and posterior zones of Antarctic S. contortum animals (Fig. 3g) , with this forepart region measuring 1.7 to 4.8 μm in length from the tip of the cephalic lobe to the beginning of the trunk. The trunk (Figs. 3l-n and 4c) comprised much of length of animals and was characterised by the presence of scattered oval plaques positioned on top of papillae ( Fig. 3l-n) . Large papillae without plaques, possibly openings of pyriform glands, also present in trunk region (Fig. 3n) . The conspecificity of Antarctic Sclerolinum with HMMV, Loki's Castle and GoM S. contortum is strongly supported by genetic data (see later). S. contortum (from HMMV) was originally distinguished from all other species in this genus based on its long opisthosoma with few segments, and a strongly twisted anterior tube region [25] . The anterior regions of tubes from the Antarctic however lack the characteristic prominent, knot-like contortions that lend S. contortum its name, being instead only faintly wavy. These contortions are also absent in some of the Loki's Castle specimens (Fig. 2d) . In addition, the GoM population shows that S. contortum opisthosoma can be longer than those of Sclerolinum magdalenae [26] and possess a similar number of segments. Hence we do not believe the wavy nature of the tube and the length of the ophisthosome are useful characters to delineate species. S. magdalenae also has a similar frenulum to S. contortum, e Anterior portion of a live worm, scale bar is 300 μm. f Trunk tissue of a live worm, scale bar is 500 μm. g Anterior portion of a worm showing the transition between the forepart and trunk (arrow), scale bar is 500 μm. h The anterior of a worm in ventral view, scale bar is 100 μm. i Detail of the frenulum and surrounding gland openings, dorsal view.

This raises the question of whether S. magdalenae may be the same species as S. contortum and thereby represent yet a further example of the wide range of this species; molecular analyses on S. magdalenae would be needed to clarify this. Antarctic S. contortum most closely resembles the HMMV population in terms of size (diameter of tube and animal, forepart length, frenular plaque size and number; Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Although animals from the various populations show broad similarity (Fig. 4 ) [25, 27] , this species is known to show pronounced morphological plasticity of its soft tissues [27] and incorporating data from the Antarctic and Loki's Castle extends the ranges of taxonomic characters for this species even further (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Ultrastructurally, tubes do not vary much between the Arctic, GoM and Antarctic populations and all exhibit both transverse and longitudinal wrinkles, while the tube abnormalities pictured in Fig. 2e are similar to those recorded for Sclerolinum brattstromi, Siboglinum ekmani and Siboglinum fiordicum [50] . Living animals were most abundant at Hook Ridge Site 1, where S. contortum has been reported at high densities (up to 800 individuals m −2 [30] ), and tube fragments with tissue were also abundant at Hook Ridge Site 2. However, the distribution of S. contortum at Hook Ridge appears to be patchy as one of the megacore samples contained only a single specimen with a head, while another contained 71 individuals [51] . Worm specimens bv -blood vessels; cb -ciliated band; cl -cephalic lobe; df -dorsal furrow; eg -epidermal glands; epf -elongated plaque of frenulum; f -frenulum; tp -trunk plaque; tpp -trunk papillae were not visible within the megacore tubes until the samples were processed, suggesting that the majority of the tubes were buried within sediments. The posterior ends of the tubes were recorded as occurring at 15 cm depth by Sahling et al. [30] , where temperatures are approximately 20°C and hydrogen sulphide concentrations reach 150 μm L −1 , increasing at greater depths [34] . No temperature anomalies were observed in any sediments during sampling in 2011 [34] . A fully oxic water column, and oxygen penetration to depths of 2-5 cm into the sediment [34] require little of the tubes to project above the sediment. Sclerolinum is not reported from parts of the Hook Ridge where temperatures reach 49°C and siliceous crusts form over the sediments [52] . SHRIMP (Seafloor High Resolution Imaging Platform) images ( Fig. 5a ). These mats also occurred around vent chimneys present at this site (Fig. 5b ) the activity of which is unknown but again no temperature anomaly was observed within what appeared to be shimmering water emanating from the chimney structure [45] . Sclerolinum sp. Southward, 1961 (  Tubes clustered and tightly embedded into upper surface of sulphurous material (Fig. 6a) , 0.23-0.34 mm in diameter (n = 10) and with a tube wall thickness of approximately 30 μm. Wavy to near straight in appearance. Outer tube surfaces exhibit prominent, irregular transverse wrinkles and faint longitudinal wrinkles (Fig. 6b) . Tube walls are multi-layered and fibrous, and in some cases have a very rough appearance due to fragmentation of outer tube layers. SEM and EDS (energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy) of the surface of the sulphurous lump shows large crystalline sulphur grains within a silica matrix (Fig. 6c) . When mapped in thin section, sulphur and silica show some zonation but also many sulphur grains incorporated into areas of silica (Fig. 6d) . Sclerolinum tubes are rooted beneath the surface of the sulphur lump, Fig. 6e shows detail of the sulphurous material with one of the embedded tubes. These tubes show very similar overall and detailed morphology to those made by Sclerolinum contortum from Hook Ridge, and it is very likely that they were therefore made by this species, however as no intact animals were found (unidentifiable tissue was present) it was not possible to confirm this. The significant lengths of the tubes (Fig. 6a) suggest that the colony may have reached maturity, however the absence of good quality animal tissue, the inability to DNA sequence tube contents, and the rough appearance of some of the tube walls suggest that the colony had started degrading and that conditions may have become unfavourable for Sclerolinum. The sulphur chunk also demonstrates a pathway through which Sclerolinum tubes may fossilise, preserved as Sclerolinum tube-shaped voids within its matrix (Fig. 6d ). Areas of diffuse venting within Kemp Caldera would be favourable habitats for Sclerolinum, however the occurrence of these animals within such a highly acidic environment, within a substrate composed largely of sulphur has not previously been observed. The three combined molecular analysis runs for the family Siboglinidae converged on the same tree topology and near identical posterior probability values (maximum variation of 4 %). The 50 % majority rule consensus tree (Fig. 7 ) indicated overall strong branch support for the monophyly of the major clades of Vestimentifera, Sclerolinum, Osedax and Frenulata. Antarctic Sclerolinum falls within a clade comprised of S. contortum from GoM and the Arctic, where GoM worms form a sister group to S. contortum from the Arctic and Antarctic Sclerolinum, with strong branch support. However, support for the sister relationship between Antarctic Sclerolinum and Arctic S. contortum is weaker. 18S was identical between Sclerolinum brattstromi, HMMV S. contortum, and Antarctic Sclerolinum, whereas for 16S, one change (a transversion) was detected between Antarctic Sclerolinum, and S. contortum from GoM, Loki's Castle and HMMV (S. brattstromi 16S was very different). COI K2P (Kimura 2 Parameter) and 'p' distances within the Sclerolinum clade varied from 0 % between S. contortum populations, to 1.4 % between S. contortum and Antarctic Sclerolinum, and were almost an order of magnitude greater between these taxa and S. brattstromi where the minimum distance detected was 8.8 % (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Within the S. contortum clade, the lowest genetic distances occurred between Loki's Castle and HMMV populations, and the greatest between the Arctic and Antarctic populations (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). The phylogenetic and haplotype analyses based on 65 S. contortum COI sequences showed 14 distinct haplotypes ( Fig. 8 ; Table 1 ; maximum variation of 3 % for posterior probability values within the phylogenetic analysis). The number of haplotypes within the Arctic and GoM populations were greater than within the Antarctic population, in which all 27 individuals form a single haplotype Table S2 ), HMMV and Loki's Castle sequences were henceforth pooled into a single Arctic population. Nucleotide diversity (π) and mean K2P distances within populations were on the whole low, and a non-synonymous substitution was found within the Arctic population ( Table 1) . The results of the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) ( Table 2) show that the largest percentage of variation occurs between the three regional populations, which also resulted in a large F ST value, whereas within population variation is considerably lower. Pairwise F ST values are high, significant, and increase with distance between populations, being greatest between the Antarctic and Arctic populations and lowest between the Arctic and GoM populations. Fig. 7 Phylogeny of the annelid family Siboglinidae. This analysis was performed using a Bayesian approach and a combined dataset of the three genes COI, 16S and 18S. The phylogeny is a 50 % consensus tree, in which numbers represent posterior probability values out of 100, and branches marked with an asterisk (*) indicate posterior probabilities equal to or greater than 95 First record of a bipolar siboglinid: geographic and genetic patterns Our data strongly supports the notion that Sclerolinum contortum is a bipolar species, with records that span almost 16,000 km from the Arctic to the Antarctic and making it the only siboglinid for which such a range has been observed. Our combined phylogenetic analysis using extended molecular data for the Sclerolinum genus demonstrates high levels of similarity of three barcoding genes COI, 16S and 18S between Antarctic Sclerolinum and S. contortum from the Arctic and GoM, and clearly distinguishes another Sclerolinum species (Sclerolinum brattstromi) from this group (Fig. 7) . In addition, the N -sample size, standard deviations are given for h and π mitochondrial marker COI also differentiates an additional two Sclerolinum species from the S. contortum clade (Kushiro SK2003 and Loihi Seamount; Fig. 8 ). COI genetic distances are more than 6 times greater between S. contortum (including the Antarctic population) and S. brattstromi compared to within the former clade (Additional file 2: Table S2 ), in which divergence is well below 3 %, the generally accepted threshold for delimiting species [53, 54] . The morphology of Antarctic Sclerolinum also generally fits within the variation observed for S. contortum from other areas, most closely resembling the soft tissue morphology of the most distant population, from HMMV (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Classifying Antarctic Sclerolinum as S. contortum despite the great distances between populations highlights the important taxonomic observation that annelids with very similar morphology and DNA can be spread over vast geographical areas, with their distributions controlled by habitat availability and local ecology. Bipolarity has so far been observed in only a handful of deep-sea organisms, but demonstrates that steep temperature gradients and limited water exchange between the Southern and surrounding oceans have not completely restricted the spread of deep-sea fauna across these barriers [40] . Southern Ocean vent sites such as the East Scotia Ridge differ from sites on Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise in that fauna such as vestimentiferan and alvinellid polychaetes, vesicomyid clams, bathymodiolid mussels, and alvinocaridid shrimp are absent [43] . However the ability of S. contortum to have migrated across Southern Ocean dispersal barriers suggests that the absence of vestimentiferans at Antarctic vent sites may not be the result of historical dispersal limitation (vicariance). The extensive, bipolar nature of this deep-sea chemosynthetic tubeworm also accentuates that being widespread in the deep-sea is a real and common pattern, with examples supported by molecular data emerging from a variety of additional taxa in recent years [8, [55] [56] [57] [58] . Although our data support S. contortum conspecificity across the Arctic, GoM and Antarctic, at a population level there is evidence that distance is a barrier to gene flow. While mixing appears to occur between the HMMV and Loki's Castle populations that are separated by approximately 270 km (Fig. 8) , this does not seem to be the case between the Arctic, GoM and Antarctic. Though these three regional populations show very high genetic similarity, the structure presented by the COI haplotype network (Fig. 8) , and the F ST values obtained for population pairs ( Table 2 ), suggest that geographic distance does present a barrier to gene flow for this species. This is largely consistent with research into the connectivity of hydrothermal vent vestimentiferans on the EPR, where for both Riftia pachyptila and Tevnia jerichonana there appears to be little gene flow between the most distant populations of these species [20, 21] . Pairwise F ST values between the most distant populations of these two species are similar to those reported for S. contortum in this study, however it is obvious that many populations of S. contortum are likely to exist between those sampled in this study, and sampling gaps have been found to inflate F ST [59] . High genetic correspondence with lack of gene flow over large distances is also characteristic of Escarpia spp., species of which show high levels of similarity in the mitochondrial genes 16S, COI and cytochrome b, but can be differentiated on their morphology, as well as by using a nuclear gene (haemoglobin subunit B2 intron) and microsatellite markers [22] . Our interpretation of geographically distant Sclerolinum populations belonging to one species contrasts with the division of Escarpia into three separate species despite their genetic similarity, however we believe our classification to be justified based on the reasons outlined above, and recommend greater caution in describing genetically-similar but geographically distant populations of siboglinids as new species based on morphology. Despite the evidence for low gene flow at regional scales, Sclerolinum contortum has managed to spread to both poles as well as subtropical latitudes, and the question remains as to how this was achieved. Nothing is presently known of the larvae of Sclerolinum, but when the larvae of the vestimentiferan Riftia pachyptila are considered, which can disperse 100 km along the EPR ridge axis [60] , it is unlikely that S. contortum larvae travelled the~10,000 km between the GoM and Hook Ridge in a single journey. As S. contortum appears to be capable of colonising a large range of substrates, dispersal over wide areas through the use of a variety of chemosynthetic habitats as 'stepping stones' [61, 62] might be the most plausible explanation for this species. Such a hypothesis may be supported by our results which show that there is greater genetic similarity between the spatially closer Arctic and GoM populations, and GoM and Antarctic populations, than there is between the two polar populations (Arctic and Antarctic; Table 2 ). However, the presently known number of S. contortum populations is too low to conduct a test for the above scenario, therefore whether this is the best model cannot be resolved at present. Stepping-stone dispersal would suggest that S. contortum is more widespread than currently supposed, which does appear to be the case in the Antarctic. The large mass of tubes recovered from Kemp Caldera suggests that S. contortum populations come and go, taking advantage of reducing conditions where they are encountered and dying out when these temporary oases dry up. Such a lifestyle may also explain the low COI haplotype diversity observed within the Antarctic population in comparison to the Arctic and GoM worms used for this study. The Antarctic population may be demonstrating the effects either of a founder event or bottleneck [63] , where a founder effect may arise as a result of a number of opportunistic S. contortum individuals finding suitable conditions and settling at Hook Ridge, and persisting in the sustained diffuse hydrothermal flow at this site. However, the ephemeral nature of hydrothermal circulation within the Bransfield Strait [45] , and repeated glacial-interglacial events affecting the Southern Ocean mean that it may also be plausible for the Antarctic S. contortum population to have undergone a bottleneck (loss of genetic diversity following a population crash) [64] . Evidence of a genetic bottleneck linked to glacial cycles has been detected for a number of Antarctic species (see [65] for a review), and ultimately more samples from a wider area of the Southern Ocean would be required to test this in S. contortum. Sclerolinum has also been shown to be capable of asexual reproduction via breaking and regenerating missing ends [66, 67] , which may also account for the low genetic diversity of the Antarctic population. There is currently no fossil record for Sclerolinum. As well as demonstrating a pathway through which Sclerolinum tubes may become preserved in the fossil record, this study shows that any future reports of Sclerolinum fossil discovery should be mindful of the following: fossils found in a range of ancient chemosynthetic environments, from very distant parts of the world, and exhibiting varying degrees of tube contortion may belong to the same species. Recent reports of Cretaceous Osedax fossils [68] imply that Siboglinidae has more ancient origins than indicated by molecular clock estimates [69] [70] [71] , suggesting that the widespread distribution, morphological and habitat plasticity exhibited by Sclerolinum may have contributed to the survival of this genus over long evolutionary timescales too [72] . We have shown that S. contortum can exhibit even greater morphological plasticity than was previously noted for this species by Eichinger et al. [27] . Much of this plasticity is in the tubes constructed by this worm after which the species is named. Tube morphology may be a condition that is dictated by environmental factors, as has previously been shown for the highly plastic tubes built by the vent dwelling vestimentiferan Ridgeia piscesae [73] . Environmental factors can also influence the physiology of these worms, thereby affecting their genetic diversity [74] . While environmental parameters were not measured by the present study, we speculate that contortion of the anterior of S. contortum tubes increases their surface area to volume ratio, thus improving the efficiency of oxygen uptake and may therefore result from settlement in lower oxygen conditions. The obvious morphological plasticity of Sclerolinum contortum is matched by its remarkable ecological and habitat plasticity. With our new data from the Antarctic we can now show that it is able to colonise a vast range of chemosynthetic habitats including high-temperature acidic white smoker vent fields, low-temperature sedimented diffuse vent fields, hydrocarbon cold seeps and mud volcanoes. Chemosynthetic invertebrates have been likened to terrestrial weeds [75] in virtue of their ability to colonise ephemeral/disturbed environments, as well as their effective dispersal, rapid growth rates, and early reproduction [76, 77] , and in this sense, we can also think of S. contortum as a 'chemosynthetic weed' due to its ability to quickly populate a wide range of sulphurrich habitats and spread over great distances. Weedy species can have a dramatic influence on the environments they colonise. Their impacts are welldocumented particularly in reference to terrestrial nonnative species, and have demonstrated the ability of weedy species to have pronounced ecosystem, community and population-level effects [78, 79] . Supporting the concept of the Sclerolinum weed is the observation that the species can have a considerable influence on the biogeochemistry of the sediment at the sediment-hosted Bransfield hydrothermal vents [34] . Along with the maldanid Nicomache lokii, S. contortum forms a complex three-dimensional habitat for free-living invertebrates at Loki's Castle [38] , as well as in the Nyegga seep area of the Storegga Slide where filamentous bacteria cover S. contortum tube surfaces, thereby also providing substrate and food for associated organisms [35] . S. contortum therefore represents an important keystone species within the range of reducing environments it inhabits. Since their initial discovery alongside hydrothermal vent chimneys in the late 1970s, siboglinid worms have continued to surprise and amaze with their unusual adaptations to a mode of life in the deep sea dependant solely on endosymbionts. By investigating in detail the DNA, morphology and a novel inhabiting substrate of the very poorly studied Sclerolinum genus, the present study has found that they too conform to this pattern, by possessing extraordinary morphological and ecological plasticity that has allowed them to occupy a remarkable range that spans across all of the world's oceans. However, fundamental knowledge of the biology of these worms is still lacking -there is presently no information on Sclerolinum reproduction, larvae and their dispersal, and symbionts from the range of chemosynthetic environments which this genus occupies. We therefore suggest these areas as potential directions for future research into this group.  Antarctic sample collection was conducted on board RRS James Cook expedition JC55 during JanuaryFebruary 2011 (Table 3) , during which Sclerolinum was collected from two locations: Hook Ridge, Bransfield Strait, and Kemp Caldera. At Hook Ridge, venting occurs through sediment as low temperature discharge of phase-separated fluids that are highly diluted by seawater [45] . At Kemp Caldera, both hot and diffuse venting has been found that is characterised by unusual, highly acidic and sulphidic fluid composition. At a site named 'Winter Palace' , crumbly chimneys release white smoker-type hydrothermal fluids up to 212°C, while at 'Great Wall' a seafloor fissure releases low temperature diffuse fluids from which sulphur-rich minerals precipitate [80] [Copley et al. in prep.]. Samples were obtained using a Bowers & Connelly megacorer fitted with multiple 10 cm-diameter polycarbonate core tubes. Sclerolinum sp. tubes containing animal tissues and empty Sclerolinum sp. tubes were collected from two Hook Ridge sites, Hook Ridge Site 1 and Hook Ridge Site 2 ( Fig. 1; Table 3 ). Sclerolinum sp. tubes from Kemp Caldera were acquired using a gravity corer, to which a sulphurous lump containing embedded tubes had become attached. Possible Siboglinidae tube fragments were collected from The Axe and Bransfield Off-vent, the latter comprising a non-active site located approximately 21 km south of the Hook Ridge sites. Samples were preserved in 80 % ethanol or 6 % formalin on board the ship. SHRIMP was used to visualise the seabed within a 20 m radius of Hook Ridge Site 1. S. contortum specimens from Loki's Castle and HMMV, Arctic Ocean, and the GoM (Additional file 3: Methods supplement) were used for morphological and genetic comparisons with Antarctic Sclerolinum sp. (Table 3 ). Taxonomic characters were measured in 10 Antarctic and 10 Loki's Castle worms. Unfortunately no complete animals were found, therefore only characters of the anterior and trunk regions of the worms were recorded. Tubes were either cut around sections of the worms, or they were visualised through their tubes using a ZEISS Discovery V.20 stereomicroscope. Measurements were performed using ZEISS AxioVision digital processing software as well as ImageJ (version 1.46r). To visualise taxonomic characters more clearly, sections of Antarctic and Loki's Castle worms were cut out of their tubes, and imaged using laser-induced autofluorescence within a Nikon A1-Si Confocal microscope at the Natural History Museum, UK (NHM), operated in spectral imaging mode. In addition, the forepart and trunk regions of a Sclerolinum sp. worm fragment from the Antarctic were critical-point dried, coated in gold-paladium, and imaged A subsection of the sulphurous lump with embedded Sclerolinum sp. tubes (recovered from Kemp Caldera, Southern Ocean) was viewed within a LEO 1455VP SEM (at the NHM), and point EDS spectra were obtained from its surface within the same SEM. The subsection was then prepared into a polished thin section and its elemental composition was mapped using EDS within a Carl Zeiss Ultra Plus Field Emission SEM, also at the NHM. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 64 Sclerolinum worm fragments: 27 Antarctic Sclerolinum sp., 15 S. contortum from the GoM, 21 S. contortum from Loki's Castle, and one S. contortum individual from HMMV. Worm fragments with tentacles and forepart, and long worm fragments were selected for extractions to increase the likelihood of sampling from different individuals. DNA extractions of Antarctic and GoM specimens were performed using a Hamilton Microlab STAR Robotic Workstation combined with a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Approximately 400 bp of the mitochondrial gene 16S, 600 bp of the mitochondrial gene COI, and 840-1370 bp of the nuclear 18S gene were amplified (all primers used for PCRs and sequencing are listed in Additional file 4: Table S3 ). PCR mixtures for Antarctic and GoM specimens contained 1 μl of each primer (10 μM), 2 μl of DNA template, and 21 μl of Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). The PCR profile was as follows: 94°C/300 s, (94°C/60s, 50°C/60s, 72°C/120 s)*35 cycles, 72°C/300 s. PCR products were visualised on 1.5 % agarose gels following electrophoresis, and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3730XL DNA Analyser at the NHM. DNA extraction and PCR of Arctic specimens (Loki's Castle and HMMV) were carried out at the Biodiversity Laboratories, University of Bergen (BDL, DNAlab section, Department of Biology) where an Applied Biosystems 3730XL DNA Analyser was used for sequencing. The PCR mixtures for amplification of 16S and COI contained 1 μl of each primer (10 μM), 1 μl of DNA template, 2.5 μl Qiagen CoralLoad buffer (10x), 1 μl Qiagen MgCl (25 μM), 2 μl dNTPs (TaKaRa; 2.5 μM of each dNTP), 0.15 μl TaKaRa HS taq, and 16.35 μl PCR water. The PCR profile for 16S was as follows: 95°C/300 s, (95°C/30s, 50°C/30s, 72°C/90s)*35 cycles, 72°C/600 s, while the following profile was used for COI: 95°C/300 s, (95°C/ 45 s, 45°C/45 s, 72°C/60s)*5 cycles, (95°C/45 s, 51°C/ 45 s, 72°C/60s)*35 cycles, 72°C/600 s. In total, 16S was sequenced for 28 worm fragments, COI for 64, and 18S for two worm fragments. Molecular phylogenetic analyses were performed using a combined dataset of 16S, COI and 18S sequences for members of the family Siboglinidae. A total of 44 terminal taxa were included in the analyses, of which five were Sclerolinum, and 39 were from other Siboglinidae genera. For the above analyses 111 sequences were obtained from NCBI Genbank, accession numbers for which are listed in Additional file 5: Table S4 . The sabellid Sabella pavonina and spionid Malacoceros fuliginosus were used as outgroup taxa, of which M. fuliginosus was used to root the tree. Outgroup choice was based on the analyses of Rousset et al. [81] and Weigert et al. [82] . Overlapping sequence fragments were concatenated into consensus sequences using Geneious [83] , and aligned using the following programs (provided as plug-ins in Geneious): MUSCLE for COI [84] , and MAFFT for 18S and 16S [85] . The evolutionary models used for each gene were selected using jModelTest [86] . Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the best fitting models of nucleotide substitution were TIM1 + I + G for COI and 18S, and TIM2 + G for 16S. As the model GTR + I + G is the closest approximation of the TIM models available in MrBayes, the GTR + I + G model was used for all three genes in the combined analysis. A Bayesian molecular phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MrBayes 3.1.2 [87] . Analyses of the combined dataset were run three times for 10,000,000 generations, with 2,500,000 generations discarded as burn-in. Genetic distances for the COI gene within the genus Sclerolinum were calculated using the K2P model, and p-distances were determined in MEGA 5.1 [88] . A close relationship between Antarctic Sclerolinum sp. and S. contortum was detected from the above investigations, therefore an additional alignment was used for a phylogenetic analysis using a total of 68 COI Sclerolinum sp. sequences (Sclerolinum brattstromi, Kushiro-SK-2003 Sclerolinum sp., Loihi Seamount Sclerolinum sp., 27 Antarctic Sclerolinum sp., 15 GoM, 21 Loki's Castle, and 2 HMMV S. contortum) for which two additional siboglinid COI sequences (Riftia pachyptila and Siboglinum ekmani) were used as outgroups. The alignment was trimmed to standardise sequence lengths, and the analysis was performed in the same way as the combined analysis outlined above. In addition, a haplotype distribution was created using only Antarctic Sclerolinum sp. and S. contortum sequences in TCS 1.21 [89] and drawn in PopART (http://popart.otago.ac.nz). Gaps were treated as missing data, and the connection limit was set to 95 %. There appeared to be little genetic differentiation between HMMV and Loki's Castle S. contortum therefore sequences from these localities were subsequently pooled into one Arctic population, while GoM S. contortum and Antarctic Sclerolinum sp. were treated as two additional populations. Haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity, and number of polymorphic sites were calculated within each population (Arctic, GoM and Antarctic) using DnaSP 5.10.1 [90] . Average genetic distances (K2P) within each population were calculated using MEGA 5.1 [88] . Pairwise F ST values and an AMOVA were computed using Arlequin 3.5.1.3 [91] . The AMOVA was performed using K2P distances and 1000 permutations. Ethics approval is not required for the collection and investigation of the morphology and DNA of annelid worms.

3128887,Spatial variations of community structures and methane cycling across a transect of Lei-Gong-Hou mud volcanoes in eastern Taiwan,"This study analyzed cored sediments retrieved from sites distributed across a transect of the Lei-Gong-Hou mud volcanoes in eastern Taiwan to uncover the spatial distributions of biogeochemical processes and community assemblages involved in methane cycling. The profiles of methane concentration and carbon isotopic composition revealed various orders of the predominance of specific methane-related metabolisms along depth. At a site proximal to the bubbling pool, the methanogenic zone was sandwiched by the anaerobic methanotrophic zones. For two sites distributed toward the topographic depression, the methanogenic zone overlaid the anaerobic methanotrophic zone. The predominance of anaerobic methanotrophy at specific depth intervals is supported by the enhanced copy numbers of the ANME-2a 16S rRNA gene and coincides with high dissolved Fe/Mn concentrations and copy numbers of the Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter 16S rRNA gene. Assemblages of 16S rRNA and mcrA genes revealed that methanogenesis was mediated by Methanococcoides and Methanosarcina. pmoA genes and a few 16S rRNA genes related to aerobic methanotrophs were detected in limited numbers of subsurface samples. While dissolved Fe/Mn signifies the presence of anaerobic metabolisms near the surface, the correlations between geochemical characteristics and gene abundances, and the absence of aerobic methanotrophs in top sediments suggest that anaerobic methanotrophy is potentially dependent on iron/manganese reduction and dominates over aerobic methanotrophy for the removal of methane produced in situ or from a deep source. Near-surface methanogenesis contributes to the methane emissions from mud platform. The alternating arrangements of methanogenic and methanotrophic zones at different sites suggest that the interactions between mud deposition, evaporation, oxidation and fluid transport modulate the assemblages of microbial communities and methane cycling in different compartments of terrestrial mud volcanoes.","Terrestrial mud volcanoes are ubiquitous in compressional tectonic regimes (Kopf, 2004) . These peculiar cone-shaped features expel fluidized muds or breccia through either seepages or explosive discharges (Mazzini, 2009) . Often, methane constitutes the major gaseous phase accompanying the release of fluids and sediments (Dimitrov, 2003) . Despite focused flows channeling along the fracture network, deeply-sourced gases and fluids also percolate through pore space of sediments via diffusion and/or advection (Milkov, 2005; Mazzini et al., 2009) . Such pervasive gas transport underneath mud volcanoes enables even greater summed methane emissions from surrounding mud platforms (termed micro-or mini-seepage) when compared with those from main conduits or fractures (termed macro-seepage) (Etiope et al., 2004a,b; Hong et al., 2013) . Unlike marine counterparts where the overlying seawater can buffer methane released from the sediment-seawater interface (Yvon-Lewis et al., 2011) , terrestrial mud volcanoes directly emit methane and gaseous hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. As the methane greenhouse effect is greater than that of CO 2 by a factor of ∼25, terrestrial mud volcanoes are considered a potent contributor intensifying climatic fluctuations on contemporary and geological time scales (Etiope et al., 2008) . The exact magnitude of methane released from or retained within terrestrial mud volcanoes is dependent on several factors. In addition to fluid transport, in situ microbial production and consumption appear to be the most critical factor governing methane abundances in the pore space and methane fluxes across the sediment-air interface (Alain et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012) . In particular, terrestrial mud volcanoes are generally limited in sulfate. Sulfate-dependent methanotrophy commonly observed in marine counterparts (Knittel and Boetius, 2009 ) would be likely inhibited under such sulfatedeficient conditions, allowing more methane emitted into the atmosphere. Using geochemical profiles, incubation approaches, and 16S rRNA gene abundances and assemblages, previous studies indicated that methane originating from deep sources mixes with microbial methane produced at shallow depths Cheng et al., 2012) . The quantities of microbial methane produced in situ are two to three times those of deeply-sourced methane, providing abundant electron donors for methanotrophy. In addition, anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME-1 to -3 lineages) proliferate in methane-transition zones, likely being coupled with either sulfate or iron/manganese reduction fueled by mineral-derived sulfate or iron/manganese oxide generated from the atmospheric oxidation of reduced sulfur or metals Cheng et al., 2012) . Such subsurface-surface interactions create steep redox gradients that lead to the compartmentalization of different metabolic schemes into discrete horizons. Metabolic stratification driven by subsurface-surface interactions in terrestrial mud volcanoes is persistent over years, effectively removing methane from the pore space Cheng et al., 2012) . However, these observations are primarily drawn from cores retrieved near fluid conduits. Considering that a typical mud volcano is cone-shaped, methane transport and emission may be susceptible to factors that would vary on multiple dimensions. First, advective methane fluxes originating from deep sources are expected to decrease as the distance from the major conduit or bubbling pool increases (Etiope et al., 2004a,b) . The decrease in methane flux also reflects the reduced flux of reducing fluid, thereby favoring the penetration of aerobic methanotrophy and other aerobic metabolisms into deeper levels while inhibiting anaerobic methanotrophy, methanogenesis, and other anaerobic metabolisms. Second, top sediments distributed along the slope of mud volcanoes are episodically immersed by fluids expelled from bubbling pools. Solute contents in pore water could be enhanced due to the loss of pore water through evaporation (Svensen et al., 2007) . Previous studies have demonstrated that evaporation could rapidly enhance solute concentrations, even for samples located close to the bubbling pool Cheng et al., 2012) . Therefore, increasing distance from the bubbling pool is expected to generate enrichments of solutes in the top pore water downslope the cone-shaped structure. Such a salinity increase would pose various effects on community assemblages and metabolic pathways. Determining the spatial variations of pore water geochemistry and microbial community structure would provide a basis for the assessment of total methane emission from a mud volcano. The aim of this study was to identify the architecture of microbial methane producing and consuming zones in a sulfatedeficient terrestrial mud volcano using geochemical patterns and community assemblages based on 16S rRNA and methane-related functional genes. This study extends previous efforts to a broader spatial scale by analyzing sediments across a transect of a cone-shaped feature at the Lei-Gong-Hou mud volcanoes (LGHMVs) in eastern Taiwan. Geochemical profiles, and gene assemblages and abundances were integrated with those obtained previously to address the spatial variations in microbial cycling of methane.  Samples were collected from the LGHMVs (22 • 58 59.02 N, 121 • 12 33.85 E) in the Kuan-Shan area in eastern Taiwan (Figure 1) . The stratum hosting the LGHMVs, the Li-Chi Formation, is distributed trending north-south on the east side of the Longitudinal Valley that separates the Coastal Range to the east from the metamorphic complex to the west (Chang et al., 2001) . The Li-Chi Formation is composed of primarily clays mixed with rock fragments in different sizes and lithologies, and represents the intra-arc sediments that formed during the convergence between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates (Chang et al., 2001) . The LGHMVs are composed of more than ten bubbling, coneshaped features distributed along a nearly north-south transect potentially related to the Longitudinal Fault. Muddy fluids with abundant hydrocarbon gases were discharged in every pool during sampling in February 2009 . Previous studies indicated that exsolved gases from bubbling pools consist primarily of methane (90-98%) with δ 13 C values ranging between −51 and −49 [referenced to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)] (Sun et al., 2010) . In addition to the bubbling pool (LGH02-ew) and cored sediments (LGH02-c1) used for the previous study , two additional cores (LGH02-c2 and -c3) at a distance of 46 and 153 cm from core LGH02-c1 were also collected (Figure 1 ). These two cores had a total length of 20 cm and were sectioned (mostly at a 2-cm interval) for analyses of gas and aqueous geochemistry, 16S rRNA gene and methane-related functional genes. Samples collected from LGH02-ew and core LGH02-c1 were also used for analyses of methane-related functional genes. Gears for core retrieval and sample processing in the field were heat-sterilized prior to the field trip. All samples were stored either at room temperature (for gas analyses) or on dry ice (for aqueous chemistry and molecular analyses) during transportation, and transferred back to the laboratory within 6 h. The reported depth represents the mean of depth across the section interval. Upon arriving at the laboratory, samples for aqueous geochemistry and DNA analyses were immediately subject to centrifugation at ∼8200 ×g for 15 min. Supernatants were decanted from the tubes, filtered using 0.22 μm pore-sized membranes, and split into two fractions; one was treated with 10% by volume of 2 M nitric acid for the preservation of cations, and the other was used for anions without any preservative. One milliliter of the anion sample was fixed with 0.1 mL of 1 M Zn-acetate for the determination of HS − concentration. Geochemical and DNA samples were stored in a 4 • C refrigerator and a −80 • C freezer, respectively, until further analysis. The abundances of major anions, dissolved Fe and Mn, sulfide, and methane, and carbon isotopic compositions of methane were measured using the same methods as those described in Chang et al. (2012) . The measured partial pressure of methane was converted to the dissolved concentration using the Henry's law constant (Wiesenburg and Guinasso, 1979) . The isotopic compositions were reported as δ notation [δ value = (R sample /R std -1) × 1000 , where R is the 13 C/ 12 C ratio and std is the VPDB]. The uncertainties for aqueous chemistry and gas abundance were ±2 and ±5%, respectively, whereas the uncertainty for δ 13 C-CH 4 was ±0.3 . Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 g of sediments at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 11, 15, and 19 cm of core LGH02-c2 and 2, 7, 11, and 19 cm of core LGH02-c3 using the MoBio Ultraclean Mega DNA Prep Soil Kit (MoBio, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction and stored in water at −20 • C. Nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from the crude extracts from 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 15 cm of core LGH02-c2 and 2, 11, and 19 cm of core LGH02-c3 using the primer pairs B27f/U1492r for bacteria (Lane, 1991) and A8f/U1513r for archaea (Huber et al., 2002) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplification scheme was the same as that described in Chang et al. (2012) . For the gene mcrA, which encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A (a key enzyme for methanogenesis and anaerobic methanotrophy), only the crude extracts obtained from 3 and 7 cm of core LGH02-c1, 6 and 15 cm of core LGH02-c2, and 2 and 11 cm of core LGH02-c3 were amplified using the primer pair ME1/ME2 (Scholten et al., 2005) . Thermal cycling was performed with an initial melting step at 94 • C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 • C for 30 s, annealing at 48 • C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 • C for 1 min, and a final elongation step at 72 • C for 7 min. The gene pmoA, encoding particulate methane monooxygenase subunit A (a key enzyme for aerobic methane oxidation), was amplified from every crude extract obtained from LGH02-ew and cores LGH02-c1 to -c3 using the primer pair of pmoA189f/pmoA682r or pmoA189f/mb661r (Costello and Lidstrom, 1999) . Thermal cycling was performed with an initial melting step at 94 • C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 • C for 30 s, annealing at 56 • C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 • C for 1 min, and a final elongation step at 72 • C for 7 min. Three to five positive PCR products were pooled, purified using the StrataPrep PCR purification kit (Stratagene, USA) and cloned using the pGEM-T cloning kit (Promega, USA) following the manufacturers' protocols. Positive inserts from each clone library were sequenced using the primers described above for 16S rRNA genes, and the primer pair M13f/M13r for methane-related functional genes. Parallel negative control was performed to assess the potential contamination introduced during the laboratory manipulation. The obtained sequences were checked for chimera formation using the Pintail (Ashelford et al., 2005) , and aligned to the closely related sequences retrieved from the GenBank and RDP databases using the Greengenes (http://greengenes. lbl.gov) (Desantis et al., 2006) . Sequences were categorized into the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) on the basis of 98% similarity cutoff. Taxonomic assignments for representative sequences were based on the results obtained from the SILVA tools (Quast et al., 2013) . The UniFrac analyses was based on the phylogenetic trees constructed by the neighbor-joining algorithm and the substitution model of the maximum composite likelihood embedded within the MEGA 4.0 program (Tamura et al., 2007) , and employed the environmental cluster algorithm for unweighted OTUs (Lozupone and Knight, 2005) . Phylogenetic trees for pmoA and mcrA genes were constructed with the neighbor-joining algorithm on amino acid sequences deduced from nucleotide sequences using the MEGA 4.0 program. The bootstrap number was computed on the basis of 1000 iterations. The accession numbers of the unique sequences deposited in the GenBank are HQ916477-HQ916659, JN811694-JN811725, JQ407233-JQ407300, JX648556-JX648564, and JX648584-JX648591 for 16S rRNA genes, JX648565-JX648573 for mcrA genes, and JX648574-JX648583 for pmoA genes. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of 16S rRNA gene copy number of bacteria, archaea, ANME-2a and Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter were performed for every crude extract from cores LGH02-c2 and -c3 on a MyiQ Real Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad, USA). In brief, each qPCR reaction contained 1X of SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA), 100 nM of each primer, and 2 μL of template. Primers and PCR conditions were the same as those described in Chang et al. (2012) . Primer specificity was first confirmed through sequencing cloned amplicons generated from qPCR assays and performing taxonomic analyses of obtained sequences. For routine qPCR analyses, primer specificity was checked by both melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. The annealing was set at the temperature generating the greatest yield [the lowest threshold cycle (C T )] while primer specificity was maintained. The standards were prepared from the cloned amplicons of these target groups obtained in the clone libraries. The concentrations of standard DNA were determined using a Qubit spectrophotometer (Invitrogen, USA). The standard DNA templates were then diluted in a 10-fold series and qPCR-amplified in order to measure the C T for a known concentration of standard DNA. The plots of C T vs. standard DNA concentration yielded the linear relationship with R 2 values greater than 0.99. The 16S rRNA gene copy number of a specific group was then calculated assuming 650 g mole −1 of one base pair of DNA.  Analyses of pore water extracted from sediments yielded distinct geochemical characteristics between cores LGH02-c2 and -c3 (Figure 2 ). Chloride concentrations in core LGH02-c2 decreased from 709 mM at the top to 490 mM at 4 cm, followed by an increase to a level between 567 and 634 mM at depth. In core LGH02-c3, chloride concentrations fluctuated between 637 and 708 mM. Sulfate remained at a low level (<40 μM) in core LGH02-c2, whereas a significant increase from 18 to 165 μM with depth was observed in core LGH02-c3. Dissolved Mn concentrations in core LGH02-c2 increased from 0.13 mM in the top sediments to 0.23 mM at 4 cm and varied between 0.13 and 0.23 mM at depth. In contrast, dissolved Mn concentrations in core LGH02-c3 were at a nearly constant level of 0.20 ± 0.02 mM (average with one standard deviation). Dissolved Fe concentrations in core LGH02-c2 exhibited a peak at 0.62 mM at 6 cm followed by a decrease toward shallower and greater depths. For comparison, dissolved Fe concentrations in core LGH02-c3 decreased from 0.23 to 0.015 mM with depth. Methane concentrations in core LGH02-c2 increased from 0.58 mM at top to 1.6 mM at 2 cm and dropped to a level of 0.52-0.76 mM at depth, whereas methane concentrations in core LGH02-c3 decreased from 1.65 to 0.15 mM with depth. Patterns of carbon isotopic compositions of methane from both cores were in general comparable to each other with 13 C-enriched methane at 5-11 cm and 13 C-depleted methane at shallower and greater depths. Sulfide and nitrate concentrations were below the detection limit. PCR amplification yielded 16S rRNA gene amplicons from all crude extracts. A total of 617 bacterial and 525 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained (Supplementary Tables 1, 2) . With a 98% similarity cutoff, 107 bacterial and 47 archaeal OTUs were identified. About 46% of bacterial OTUs and 40% of archaeal OTUs appeared to be singletons (appearing only once in any library). Bacterial communities were diverse and complexly structured (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Taxonomic analyses revealed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Spirochaetes were the most abundant phyla identified (summed up to be more than 80% of the clones in each clone library). The proportion of each phylum/division varied among the samples. In particular, Cyanobacteria outnumbered other phyla/divisions in the top sediments of core LGH02-c2. Bacteroidetes constituted the most abundant phylum/division at 2, 4, and 6 cm of core LGH02-c2, and at 2 and 11 cm of core LGH02-c3, whereas Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria outnumbered others at 15 cm of core LGH02-c2 and 19 cm of core LGH02-c3, respectively. Clone sequences belonging to Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Deferribacteres, Lentisphaerae, Nitrospirae, OP9, OP11, Planctomycetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, and Zetaproteobacteria were observed in a minor proportion. Sequences of dominant bacterial OTUs (>10% of the clones in any individual library) were affiliated with Bacteroidetesrelated clones recovered from hydrocarbon degradation enrichments (Knight et al., 1999; Alain et al., 2012 ) (LGH02-B-052 and -053), an uncultured Cyanobacteria-related clone from a wetland (LGH02-B-090), uncultured Deltaproteobacteria-related clones obtained from the Kazan mud volcano (Pachiadaki et al., 2010 ) (LGH02-B-027), an uncultured Desulfuromonadalesrelated clone (LGH02-B-030), Desulfuromonas spp. (Coates et al., 1995) (LGH02-B-22) , an unclassified clone (LGH02-B-178), Thiohalophilus thiocyanatoxydans (Sorokin et al., 2007 ) (LGH02-B-012), and an uncultured Clostridiales-related clone from a coral (Sunagawa et al., 2009) (LGH02-B-174) . The proportions of these OTUs in each library varied substantially. In particular, OTUs LGH02-B-052 and -053 dominated over others at 2, 4, and 6 cm of core LGH02-c2, and at 2 and 11 cm of core LGH02-c3. OTUs LGH02-B-022 and -030 were abundant at 15 cm of core LGH02-c2, and at 2 and 11 cm of core LGH02-c3. OTUs LGH02-B-090, -174 and -178, and OTU LGH02-B-012 were abundant at shallow intervals of core LGH02-c2 and the deepest interval of core LGH02-c3, respectively. OTU LGH02-B-027 was only detected in core LGH02-c2. In addition to the major OTUs described above, the OTUs with an overall frequency greater than 1% possessed sequences affiliated with culture sequences belonging to Desulfovibrio alkaliphilus ) (LGH02-B-136), Pelobacter acetylenicus (Schink, 1985) Bacteroidetes (Isenbarger et al., 2008 ) (LGH02-B-054), Firmicutes (Hubert et al., 2009; Orcutt et al., 2010 ) (LGH02-B-066), Spirochaetes (LGH02-B-097 and -150), and Lentisphaerae (Bano and Hollibaugh, 2002 ) (LGH02-B-100). Archaeal communities were essentially composed of ANME members and methanogens although a few crenarchaeal and thaumarchaeal clones were detected (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 2) . Of archaeal OTUs, ANME members constituted 23-55 and 3-60% of clones in individual libraries of cores LGH02-c2 and -c3, respectively. Most detected ANME-related sequences were phylogenetically assigned to the ANME-2a group and shared ≥98% similarity with ANME-2a sequences recovered from core LGH02-c1 or 92-97% similarity with sequences from the Nankai Trough (Miyashita et al., 2009) , the Baltic Sea (Jagersma et al., 2009) , the Okinawa Trough (Inagaki et al., 2006) and other onshore and offshore methane-rich sediments (Hinrichs et al., 1999; Knittel et al., 2005; Alain et al., 2006; Kendall et al., 2007) . Few ANME-1 sequences affiliated with those obtained from the Kazan mud volcano (Pachiadaki et al., 2010) and freshwater sediments in the Kanto Plain of Japan (Takeuchi et al., 2009) were recovered from 0.5, 2 and 15 cm of core LGH02-c2 and 19 cm of core LGH02-03. A total of 30 clone sequences from cores LGH02-c2 and -c3 were assigned to the AAA (AOM Associated Archaea) lineage (Supplementary Table 2 ) that has been proposed to be capable of oxidizing methane anaerobically (Knittel and Boetius, 2009 ). Most of the AAA-related sequences were clustered into one OTU and particularly enriched at 19 cm of core LGH02-c3 (20% of the clones in the library). The proportions of Methanosarcinales-related clones resembled those of Methanomicrobiales-related clones at 2, 4, and 6 cm of core LGH02-c2 (Figure 3) . However, Methanosarcinalesrelated clones outnumbered Methanomicrobiales-related clones in other samples. The majority of these Methanosarcinalesrelated sequences were affiliated with Methanosarcina semesiae (Lyimo et al., 2000 (Lyimo et al., , 2009 and Methanococcoides methylutens (Sowers and Ferry, 1983) , both of which are obligatorily methylotrophic methanogens. Other Methanosarcinales-related sequences were affiliated with uncultured sequences recovered from a wetland and from the Kazan mud volcanoes (Pachiadaki et al., 2010) , Methanosaeta spp. (Zengler et al., 1999) , Methanococcoides spp. (Asakawa et al., 1998) , and Methanolobus profundi . Within Methanomicrobiales, sequences related to Methanoplanus petrolearius (Ollivier et al., 1997) , Methanocalculus pumilus (Mori et al., 2000) , and uncultured sequences retrieved from the Pearl River estuary (Jiang et al., 2011) 2007; Kormas et al., 2008 ) and a hypersaline mat (Robertson et al., 2009) , MCG from various environments (Huang et al., 2003; Nelson et al., 2009; Kubo et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012) , SAGMEG from South African gold mine groundwater and a hypersaline mat (Takai et al., 2001; Robertson et al., 2009) , and SCG from groundwater in a Japanese gold mine (Nunoura et al., 2005) were also obtained. PCR amplification yielded amplicons of mcrA genes for two samples selected from each core. A total of 356 sequences were clustered into nine OTUs (98% similarity) (Figures 3, 4) . About 92 and 68% of mcrA gene sequences from cores LGH02-c1 and -c2, respectively, were represented by OTU LGH02-M-01 and affiliated with the ANME-2 related sequences recovered from coastal (Roussel et al., 2009 ) and estuarine sediments (Jiang et al., 2011) . In contrast, only 20% of mcrA gene sequences from core LGH02-c3 were related to the ANME-2 lineage. The second largest OTU (LGH02-M-02) constituted about 20% of the total clones and possessed sequences affiliated with environmental sequences recovered from estuarine sediments (Jiang et al., 2011) and Methanosarcina spp. known to being capable of using acetate and methyl-compounds for methane production (Whitman et al., 2006) . About 3-10% of sequences were related to clone sequences from estuarine sediments (Jiang et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2013) and classified into lineages belonging to Methanospirillum (LGH02-M-03) Methanococcoides (LGH02-M-04), Methanoplanus (LGH02-M-05) and Methanosarcina (LGH02-M-06). A few sequences were related to the ANME-1 (LGH02-M-07) and Methanomicrobiales (LGH-M-09). PCR amplification using the primer pair A189f/A682r did not yield any amplicon. Instead, pmoA genes were only detected from sediments at 4, 6, and 11 cm of core LGH02-c2 using the primer pair A189f/mb661. A total of 74 sequences were categorized into ten OTUs at a 98% similarity cutoff (Figure 5 ). These sequences were classified as type I methanotrophs within the Gammaproteobacteria. The majority of these sequences (∼64% of the total clones) represented by OTUs LGH02-pmoA-1, −3, and −6 formed a monophyletic lineage that is distinct from all the other reported pmoA sequences. The exact topology between this lineage and other methanotrophs or environmental sequences could not be constrained confidently as the bootstrap value was less than 50% on both the amino acid ( Figure 5 ) and nucleic acid levels (data not shown). Comparisons with sequences deposited in the GenBank showed that these sequences were related to uncultured Methylococcales-related clones obtained from lake sediments (Lin et al., 2004) or to strain M200 (Kip et al., 2011) , Methylosoma spp. (Bussmann et al., 2006) and Methylovurum spp. (Iguchi et al., 2011) , all of which rely on methane and methanol as carbon and energy sources. The other numerically abundant sequences represented by OTUs LGH02-pmoA-2, −5, and −9 were related to Methylomicrobium pelagicum (Sieburth et al., 1987; Bowman et al., 1995) or uncultured Methylococcalesrelated clones obtained from landfill soils . This closest strain also relies on methane and methanol as carbon and energy sources (Sieburth et al., 1987) . The proportions of the largest two clusters did not vary systematically with depth. A few sequences were affiliated with Methylohalobius spp. isolated from an alkaline lake (Heyer et al., 2005) or with uncultured clones recovered from a hydrothermal field (Kato et al., 2009 ). The qPCR analyses revealed that the gene abundances of all investigated taxonomic groups varied in accordance with the dissolved Fe profiles (Figure 2) . The bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances in core LGH02-c2 ranged between 1.46 × 10 6 and 2.70 × 10 8 copies (g −1 sediments). Along the depth profile, an increase from 1.46 × 10 6 to 2.70 × 10 8 copies (g −1 sediments) at ≤11 cm was followed by a decrease of one to two orders of magnitude at 11-19 cm. The Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter members made up 25 to >100% of the bacterial abundances. Their abundances varied in a fashion similar to those of bacteria. The archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundances ranged between 1.48 × 10 5 and 1.49 × 10 7 copies (g −1 sediments), whereas the ANME-2a 16S rRNA gene abundances detected by two different ANME2a specific primers varied from 3.80 × 10 3 to 2.39 × 10 6 copies (g −1 sediments) and from 9.02 × 10 1 to 1.34 × 10 4 copies (g −1 sediments), respectively. The sum of these two ANME-2a subgroups constituted 3-39% of the archaeal abundances. The gene abundance patterns for archaea and ANME-2a were comparable with those for bacteria and Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter. In core LGH02-c3, the bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundances decreased from 1.05 × 10 8 copies (g −1 sediments) at 2 cm to 2.29 × 10 6 copies (g −1 sediments) at 7 cm, increased to 1.26 × 10 7 copies (g −1 sediments) at 11 cm, and decreased to 3.10 × 10 5 copies (g −1 sediments) at 19 cm. The abundances of the other investigated taxonomic groups exhibited a pattern similar to that of bacteria. Principle component analyses (PCA) revealed that PC1 and PC2 could explain ∼29 and ∼45% the variance in the bacterial and archaeal communities, respectively (Figure 6 ). For bacteria, communities at 3, 7, 9, and 29 cm of core LGH02-c1, 15 cm of core LGH02-c2, and 2, 11, and 19 cm of core LGH02-c3 clustered near the origin of the plot ( Figure 6A ). Three other clusters were formed by two samples from similar depths of the same core (groups composed of communities at 15 and 21 cm of core LGH02-c1, of communities at 0.5 and 2 cm of core LGH02-c2, and of communities at 4 and 6 cm of core LGH02-c2). The community associated with the bubbling fluid was distinguished from the groups described above. For archaea, communities at 3, 7, and 9 cm of core LGH02-c1 and 11 cm of core LGH02-c3 formed a cluster in the third quadrant of the plot, whereas communities at 15, 21, and 29 cm of core LGH02-c1 and from the bubbling fluids clustered in the fourth quadrant ( Figure 6B) . Communities in core LGH02-c2 and at the top and bottom of core LGH02-c3 were distributed over the first and second quadrants. Previous studies have suggested that subsurface-surface interactions are essential to charge the deeply-sourced fluids with substantial amounts of electron acceptors for anaerobic metabolisms in terrestrial mud volcanoes Cheng et al., 2012) . To assess the role of surface processes in shaping community assemblages at different sites of the LGHMVs, the field observations were examined. The sites for cores LGH02-c1, -c2, and -c3 were distributed along a gulley between four coneshaped structures covered by patchy yellowish and oily materials (Figure 1) . As evidenced by the mud hardness and the distribution of mud crack, the site proximal to the bubbling pool (e.g., core LGH02-c1) was immersed by the expelled fluids at a frequency much greater than the distant site (e.g., core LGH02-c3). The presence of a thick soft mud pile and simultaneous release of mud with fluids also suggest high rates of mud accumulation at sites near the bubbling pool. Therefore, the site for core LGH02-c1 would experience cycled wetting and drying as well as mud deposition at a frequency greater than the other two sites. In contrast, the site for core LGH02-c3 would experience less frequent fluid immersion and mud accumulation than the other two sites, and be subject to more intensive drying and evaporation. The progressive enhancement of evaporation with increasing distance from the bubbling pool is supported by chloride concentrations in pore water extracted from the cored sediments. When compared with that in the bubbling fluid (333 mM), the chloride concentrations in the top pore water increased from 527 mM for core LGH02-c1 to ∼700 mM for the other two cores (Figure 2) . The averaged chloride concentration (± one standard deviation) in pore water also increased from 586 ± 41 mM for core LGH02-c1, to 598 ± 58 mM for core LGH02-c2, and 679 ± 23 mM for core LGH02-c3. Considering that the detected chloride concentrations are far less than the halite solubility at the in situ temperature, the enhancement in the chloride concentration of the top pore water reflects the effects of short-term evaporation on the overflowing bubbling fluid. Compounds susceptible to microbial transformation (e.g., methane) exhibit drastically different patterns and variation magnitudes from those (e.g., chloride) inert to abiotic and biotic reactions (Figure 2) . Such a difference is essentially accounted for by physiological capabilities and activities that would transiently surpass the effect of fluid processes as well as mineral formation, dissolution and sorption Cheng et al., 2012) . Therefore, potential microbial metabolisms could be determined using the observed geochemical abundances while excluding the signals inherited from abiotic processes. Metabolisms catalyzing methane cycling in the cored sediments were first assessed using the geochemical characteristics of the pore water (Figure 2) . Like those interpreted in the previous study , the variations in concentration and δ 13 C value of methane for core LGH02-c2 suggest the compartmentalization of methanogenesis at <4 cm and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) at 4-13 cm. Aerobic methanotrophy is likely not significant at shallow depths. This is because culture experiments have shown that aerobic methanotrophy preferentially utilizes 12 CH 4 over 13 CH 4 with an isotopic fractionation magnitude of 2-35 (Templeton et al., 2006) . If aerobic methane oxidizers are active in consuming methane, the δ 13 C-CH 4 values would have been shifted toward a higher range. The virtually identical δ 13 C-CH 4 values at the two shallowest intervals do not corroborate this assertion. In addition, the high concentration of 13 C-depleted methane and the presence of dissolved Fe/Mn at shallower depths signify methanogenesis and metal reduction, both of which are obligatorily anaerobic metabolisms. The most plausible explanation for the depletion in abundance and isotopic composition near the surface would be the loss of subsurface methane to the atmosphere when taking into account that methane levels in the atmosphere are low (∼2 ppmv) and molecular diffusion at the centimeter scale would not cause significant isotopic fractionation. The possibility that aerobic methanotrophy is confined within 0.5 cm could not be completely excluded. Determination of the fine-scaled variations in dissolved methane and oxygen concentration is warranted to address the exact distribution of aerobic methanotrophy. In addition to the depletion of 13 C-enriched methane, the AOM zone is also characterized by the enhancement of dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations (up to 0.62 mM Fe and 0.23 mM Mn) (Figure 2) . Therefore, high correlations between δ 13 C-CH 4 values and dissolved Fe/Mn concentrations [Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.73 for Fe and 0.66 for Mn (p < 0.05)] are consistent with the presence of metal-dependent anaerobic methanotrophy (Beal et al., 2009; Sivan et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2012) . At depths greater than 13 cm of core LGH02-c2, δ 13 C-CH 4 values decreased to -42 while methane concentrations remained at a nearly constant level of 0.6 mM. The depletion of 13 C in methane was less significant at >13 cm than that at shallow intervals. This combined with a nearly constant concentration of methane suggests that AOM prevails to this depth interval and is sustained by in situ methanogenesis and/or deeply-sourced methane, with δ 13 C-CH 4 values ranging between -51 and -49 (Sun et al., 2010) . The profile of methane concentration in core LGH02-c3 was different from that in core LGH02-c2 (Figure 2) . While methane concentrations decreased gradually with depth, δ 13 C-CH 4 values were at a maximum of −36 at 7 cm and decreased toward shallower and deeper regions. The geochemical pattern suggests that methanogenesis and AOM were active at <5 and 5-11 cm, respectively. For intervals deeper than 11 cm, the depletion in abundance and isotopic composition of methane contradicts the expression of methanogenesis. Instead, the mixing between residual methane derived from the methanotrophic zone at 5-11 cm and a deep component characterized by the depleted isotopic composition (between −51 and −49 ; Sun et al., 2010) could account for the observed variations. With the exclusion of the data from the depth of 2 cm, δ 13 C-CH 4 values are correlated with dissolved Fe and sulfate concentrations, respectively [Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.84 for Fe and −0.96 for sulfate (p < 0.05)] but irrelevant with dissolved Mn concentrations (p > 0.05). These lines of evidence suggest that AOM is potentially dependent on iron and sulfate reduction processes and manganese reduction is driven by organic mineralization. The geochemical inference for methanotrophy and methanogenesis is supported by the molecular results (Figures 2, 3) . Like those observed for core LGH02-c1 , the gene copy numbers of ANME-2a and Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter populations were high at 4-11 cm of core LGH02-c2 (constituting 17-38% of the archaeal populations and >100% of the bacterial populations, respectively). The log-scaled ANME-2a abundances are correlated with the δ 13 C-CH 4 values [Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.78 (p < 0.05)], a pattern consistent with the geochemical interpretation that AOM is active in the methane transition zone. Furthermore, since Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter members are potential iron/manganese reducers (Lovley, 2006) , positive correlation between the gene abundances of Desulfuromonas/Pelobacter and ANME-2a lineages [Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.99 (p < 0.05)] again suggests a likely metabolic interdependence between AOM and iron/manganese reduction. The ANME-2a abundances in core LGH02-c3 exhibited a pattern different from those in the other two cores. The gene copy numbers generally decreased with depth, with an exception that an increase by a factor of ∼2 was observed for samples at 7 and 11 cm of core LGH02-c3. The summed ANME2a abundance at 11 cm (5.24 × 10 5 copies g −1 sediments) was, however, 4-40 times less than those in the methane transition zones of the other two cores. While the high δ 13 C-CH 4 values indicate the presence of AOM, the low abundance of ANME-2a members together with limited methane depletion at ≥7 cm suggests that AOM might not be as active as in the other two cores. Methanogens represent the other major component of archaeal communities at the LGHMVs (Figure 3) . Their relative abundances in the 16S rRNA or mcrA gene clone libraries were inversely correlated with those of the ANME-2a members. Most of these methanogen-related sequences were affiliated with obligatorily methylotrophic methanogens (Methanococcoides spp. and Methanosarcina spp.; Figures 3, 4) (Asakawa et al., 1998; Lyimo et al., 2000 Lyimo et al., , 2009 . These methanogens can proliferate under saline or hypersaline conditions by metabolizing methylcompounds produced from the fermentation of osmoprotectants (e.g., choline, glycine betaine) that are used to counterbalance osmotic stress (Whitman et al., 2006) . The prevalence of Methanosarcina and Methanococcoides over other methanogens has been constantly observed in hypersaline environments, such as microbial mats in Baja California (Orphan et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2008) . However, surface evaporation at the LGHMVs does not generate salinities falling into the hypersaline range. In addition, neither the proportions nor the abundances of these methanogens were correlated with the variations in pore water salinity (p > 0.05). As stated previously, the high methane concentrations and low δ 13 C-CH 4 values near the surface in cores LGH02-c2 and -c3 suggest active methanogenesis. Therefore, the prevalence of these obligatorily methylotrophic methanogens near the surface seems to be best explained by their physiological durability against transient desiccation and oxygen perfusion associated with surface evaporation. The pmoA gene, which is responsible for aerobic methane oxidation, was only detected at 4, 6, and 11 cm of core LGH02-c2. The detected pmoA gene sequences were related to type I methanotrophs belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria (Figure 5) . Most of these sequences were clustered into two OTUs (90% of the total clones) and affiliated with aerobic methanotrophs relying solely on methane and methanol (Sieburth et al., 1987; Bussmann et al., 2006; Iguchi et al., 2011) . The presence of these sequences is partly consistent with abundant methane but does not corroborate with the anoxic conditions at these depth intervals geochemically and molecularly interpreted as the AOM zone. Since no culture evidence has attested that these Gammaproteobacteria could use nitrate, nitrite, or metal oxides as electron acceptors for methanotrophy, these sequences probably represent the relics of aerobic methanotrophs that proliferate upon exposure to the atmosphere and survive being buried in the anoxic environment. The rare detection of 16S rRNA genes affiliated with known aerobic methanotrophs (7 out of 1305 sequences in Supplementary  Table 1 ) from all three cores and the absence of these sequences in the top sediments further suggest that aerobic methanotrophy might not contribute significantly to the overall methane cycling at the LGHMVs. Combining geochemical and molecular data reported in this and previous studies reveals that methanogenesis and AOM are prevalent regardless of the investigated site. However, their distribution along depth varied from site to site. At the site proximal to the bubbling pool (LGH02-c1), the AOM zone was underlain by the methanogenic and another AOM zones. In contrast, the methanogenic zone overlaid the AOM zone in two other cores (LGH02-c2 and -c3) distributed away from the bubbling pool. The reversible and alternating order of AOM and methanogenic zones along depth is not uncommon at the LGHMVs. For example, the AOM zone was either sandwiched or underlain by the methanogenic zone in other cores retrieved 18 months later from the other sites near bubbling pools . The alternating distribution of AOM and methanogenic zones is, however, not consistent with the successive predominance of sulfate reduction, AOM, and methanogenesis in marine sediments or terrestrial aquifers, a metabolic zonation pattern controlled by the competition for limited organic matters and H 2 (Hoehler et al., 1998) . Instead, the pattern seems to reflect the development and superposition of one specific metabolic zone over one developed previously, a scenario analogous to mud deposition over time. The enhanced methane concentrations, low δ 13 C-CH 4 values, and predominance of sequences affiliated with obligatorily methylotrophic methanogens near the surface also suggest that the mud platform could be an effective source of methane emission. Oxygen penetration is apparently attenuated by active oxygen consumption through biological respiration, and is thereby limited at very shallow intervals. Therefore, oxygen-sensitive methanogenesis could occur close to the surface. Previous studies have revealed that the summed flux of methane emission from the mud platform could exceed that from the corresponding macroseepages by up to two orders of magnitude and attributed this to the gas transport through either pore space or micro-/miniseepages (Etiope et al., 2004a,b; Hong et al., 2013) . The results observed in this study provide an alternative mechanistic explanation that methanogenesis in near-surface environments can account for enhanced methane emissions from the mud platform. Sulfate concentrations increased from nearly below the limit of detection at 2 cm to 165 μM at the deepest interval in core LGH02-c3 (Figure 2) . In addition, sulfate depletion occurred at depth intervals (5-10 cm) coinciding with the high δ 13 C-CH 4 values, the decrease in methane concentration, and the high dissolved Fe concentrations. Considering that the bubbling fluid with 23 μM sulfate represents a deeply-sourced fluid , the high sulfate level at depth would require an additional source and could be accounted for by anaerobic sulfur disproportionation or sulfur oxidation potentially driven by the reduction of iron oxyhydroxide (Holmkvist et al., 2011) . Such geochemical characteristics also indicate that AOM might be dependent on iron and sulfate reduction. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed that a great proportion of bacterial sequences at 15 and 21 cm of core LGH02-c1 (18.4 and 8.0%) and 19 cm of core LGH02-c3 (29.3%) were affiliated with sequences retrieved from bubbling fluids and surface sediments of terrestrial and marine mud volcanoes (Yakimov et al., 2002; Omoregie et al., 2008 Omoregie et al., , 2009 , and with Thiohalophilus thiocyanatoxydans strain HRhD 2 (Sorokin et al., 2007) at ≥96% similarity (Supplementary Table 1 ). This strain is known to grow using thiosulfate and nitrate as energy sources under saline conditions (1-4 M NaCl) (Sorokin et al., 2007) . As sulfate represents the end product from the oxidation of thiosulfate, the observed increase in the sulfate concentration is likely accounted for by the Thiohalophilus-related microorganisms. The clone library analyses also indicated that some bacterial sequences were related to Desulfovibrio alkaliphilus, Desulfobacterium spp. and unclassified Desulfobacterales and Desulfarculales sequences (Supplementary Table 1 ). Although the abundances of these potential sulfate reducers were low at these or adjacent intervals, their presence is presumably linked to the observed decrease in sulfate concentration. Whether these potential sulfate reducers are involved in the AOM remains to be investigated. OTUs LGH02-B-052 and -53 with sequences classified into Bacteroidetes were represented by 17.7% of the total clones (Supplementary Table 1 ). Their proportions in clone libraries were enhanced at depth intervals geochemically and molecularly interpreted as the AOM zone (Figure 2) . Most related sequences are derived from mixed populations of polluted sediments and enrichment cultures capable of anaerobically degrading complex organic compounds (e.g., benzene, phenol) (Knight et al., 1999; Alain et al., 2012) . Whether and how microorganisms represented by the detected sequences are capable of degrading organic compounds or involved in the metabolic network related to the AOM warrants more investigation. Finally, OTU LGH02-B-90, represented by sequences related to Cyanobacteria, constituted 45.0% of the clones recovered from 0.5 cm of core LGH02-c2. Its relative abundance in this core decreased significantly with depth (from 45.0% at 0.5 cm to 1.1% at 15 cm). The decreasing trend of cyanobacteria is consistent with the phototrophic and oxygen producing natures of cyanobacteria, and further suggests that the proliferation of cyanobacteria in the top sediments would intensify the redox gradient and provide an additional pathway of primary production and carbon sequestration in terrestrial mud volcanoes. The unweighted Unifrac PCA revealed that bacterial communities in a specific metabolic zone of a core were more similar to each other than those in a different metabolic zone ( Figure 6A ). For example, samples from 3, 7, 9, and 29 cm and from 15 to 21 cm of core LGH02-c1 were geochemically and molecularly interpreted as the AOM and methanogenic zones, respectively. Communities in these samples were categorized into two clusters in accordance with the interpretations. A similar clustering pattern was observed for core LGH02-c2 (0.5 and 2 cm for methanogenesis, and 4 and 6 cm for AOM) but not for core LGH02-c3. If all communities are pooled together, communities recovered from individual metabolic zones in different cores are not coherently clustered. For archaea, communities from either core LGH02-c1 or -c2 could be differentiated from each other mostly by PC1 ( Figure 6B) . Furthermore, communities from core LGH02-c1 could be differentiated from those from core LGH02-c2 mostly by PC2. Archaeal communities from core LGH02-c3 were distributed over the entire plot. Compared to bacterial communities, archaeal communities exhibited no systematic variation with respect to depth or metabolic characteristics. The clustering pattern for bacterial communities from cores LGH02-c1 and -c2 suggests that a specific community function could be mediated by different community members. As the imposed geochemical context varies from site to site, different community members possessing similar metabolic capabilities might be stimulated or inhibited by varying degrees. Therefore, their role in the metabolic network could be possibly swapped among different members whose physiological limitations could be accommodated under a specific geochemical context. In contrast, the lack of correlation between the archaeal assemblage and specific methane-related metabolism suggests that factors other than the observed geochemical characteristics are required to account for community variance. Since most detected archaeal members are affiliated with ANME-2a and Methanosarcinales, the community variance could be controlled by the presence or absence of minor community members. Overall, the discordance between community clustering and metabolic interpretation might reflect the heterogeneous nature of geochemical characteristics over various spatial scales in terrestrial mud volcanoes. We note that the community pattern could be biased by PCR or sequencing depth and DNA signatures may not be necessarily translated into metabolic activity or population size. The geochemical patterns and assemblages of 16S rRNA and methane-related genes suggest the prevalence and stratified distribution of AOM and methanogenesis at different sites of the LGHMVs. The order of predominant methane-related metabolisms along depth, however, varied from site to site. At the site near the fringe of the bubbling pool, the AOM zone overlaid the methanogenic zone, providing an effective biological filtration for the removal of methane produced in situ or migrating from a deep source. For sites away from the bubbling pool, the methanogenic zone overlaid the AOM zone, highlighting a potential contribution of near-surface methanogenesis from the mud platform to the overall methane emission in the area. In situ methanogenesis catalyzed by methylotrophic methanogens produced methane at quantities sufficient to fuel anaerobic methanotrophy. Finally, the downcore alternating sequences of the methanogenic and AOM zones at different sites provide evidence that the pattern of metabolic and geochemical zonation is modulated by the frequency and magnitude of mud deposition on the surface as well as the fluid transport and mixing processes in the subsurface. Such subsurface-surface interactions would enable the transient development of various organizations of methane cycling in sulfate-deficient terrestrial mud volcanoes.",Pei-Ling Wang,2014,24723919,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00121
46855510,Portable laser spectrometer for airborne and ground-based remote sensing of geological CO_2 emissions,"A 24 kg, suitcase sized, CW laser remote sensing spectrometer (LARSS) with a ~2 km range has been developed. It has demonstrated its flexibility in measuring both atmospheric CO2 from an airborne platform and terrestrial emission of CO2 from a remote mud volcano, Bledug Kuwu, Indonesia, from a ground-based sight. This system scans the CO2 absorption line with 20 discrete wavelengths, as opposed to the typical two-wavelength online offline instrument. This multi-wavelength approach offers an effective quality control, bias control, and confidence estimate of measured CO2 concentrations via spectral fitting. The simplicity, ruggedness, and flexibility in the design allow for easy transportation and use on different platforms with a quick setup in some of the most challenging climatic conditions. While more refinement is needed, the results represent a stepping stone towards widespread use of active one-sided gas remote sensing in the earth sciences.","Geological gases such as SO2 and CO2 being linked to subsurface processes are quantitative indicators of Earth's geochemical and geomechanical activity [1] [2] [3] [4] . Magmatic CO2, for instance, is a viable tracer of periods of volcanic unrest [5] [6] [7] . As a geological gas, volcanic CO2 is part of the global geochemical carbon cycle [8, 9] . Also part of this cycle is mud volcanism, a manifestation of liquefied sediments and gases reaching the surface due to overpressure and buoyancy [10] . To enhance our understanding of volcanoes and mud volcanoes and their significance within the carbon cycle, measuring their CO2 output is therefore imperative. In-situ probing of CO2 is common [4, 11, 12] , but requires knowledge about vent location which may render emission measurements incomplete [7] . Many geological sources emit diffusively, making in-situ probing a lengthy procedure. Particularly near volcanoes and mud volcanoes in-situ measurements may be hazardous to personnel and equipment. In addition, many sites are located in remote and hard to reach areas. Optical remote sensing offers a spatially comprehensive measurement with large spatial coverage, a safer measurement distance and increased timeliness of acquisition. Passive techniques have demonstrated this for decades [13, 14] . Active techniques allow more flexible acquisition geometries. By performing an angular scan, gas concentration profiles are attained, which can be used to compute fluxes. As single-ended, active remote sensors, LIDAR instruments based on differential absorption (DIAL) are particularly viable for that task. They acquire range resolved [15, 16] or path averaged [17, 18] CO2 concentrations, the latter using a topographic target (hard target) as backscatterer. Only recently, however, volcanic CO2 has successfully been measured using these techniques [18, 19] . Remote sensing instruments for geological gas detection should be as rugged, compact and portable as possible. Technology has advanced sufficiently for DIAL-type instruments to be realized that fulfill these requirements [20, 21] . Yet, these instrumental platforms are still far from mature, but subject to intense research. Our previous experience shows that inevitable wavelength dependencies of the transmittance of the instrument's optical components itself can make it demanding to differentiate between changes in the baseline due to actual gas absorption and parasitic changes due to non-stationary noise [22, 23] . A major contribution to this non-statistical noise is by interference fringes occurring at optical interfaces within the instrument itself. Furthermore, for shorter measurement ranges, where speckle integration over the telescope field of view is less efficient, hard target speckle contribute to non-random noise.

206164693,"Aquipuribacter nitratireducens sp. nov., isolated from a soil sample of a mud volcano","A novel Gram-stain-positive, coccoid, non-motile bacterium, designated strain AMV4T, was isolated from a soil sample collected from a mud volcano located in the Andaman Islands, India. The colony was pale orange. Strain AMV4T was positive for oxidase, aesculinase, lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase activities and negative for amylase, catalase, cellulase, protease, urease and lipase activities. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain AMV4T was a member of the order Actinomycetales and was closely related to Aquipuribacter hungaricus with a sequence similarity of 97.13% (pairwise alignment). Phylogenetic analyses showed that strain AMV4T clustered with Aquipuribacter hungaricus and was distantly related to the other genera of the family Intrasporangiaceae. DNA-DNA hybridization between strains AMV4T and Aquipuribacter hungaricus IV-75T showed a relatedness of 28%. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (6.9%), anteiso-C15 : 0 (25.3%), C16 : 0 (12.9%), anteiso-C16 : 0 (5.6%), C18 : 1ω9c (19.8%) and C18 : 3ω6,9,12c (9.1%). The diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain AMV4T was meso-diaminopimelic acid. Strain AMV4T contained MK-10(H4) as the predominant respiratory quinone. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified glycolipid, two unidentified phospholipids and five unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content of strain AMV4T was 74.3 mol%. Based on data from this taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach, it is proposed that strain AMV4T represents a novel species of the genus Aquipuribacter, with the suggested name Aquipuribacter nitratireducens sp. nov. The type strain is AMV4T ( = CCUG 58430T = DSM 22863T = NBRC 107137T).","was distantly related to the other genera of the family Intrasporangiaceae.

Based on data from this taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach, it is proposed that strain AMV4 T represents a novel species of the genus Aquipuribacter, with the suggested name Aquipuribacter nitratireducens sp. nov. The type strain is AMV4 T (5CCUG 58430 The genus Aquipuribacter was established with a single species Aquipuribacter hungaricus by Tó th et al. (2012) as a member of the family Intrasporangiaceae. A. hungaricus is Gram-stain-positive, exhibits a rod-coccus cycle, is non-endospore forming and grows aerobically. Cells are non-motile and form pale orange, smooth, convex and circular colonies. Cells have meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDpm) as the cell wall component, MK-10(H 4 ) as the predominant quinone, phosphatidylglycerol as the major polar lipid, anteiso-C 15 : 0 , C 18 : 1 v9c and C 16 : 0 as major cellular fatty acids with a DNA G+C content of 75 mol%. A strain of the species A. hungaricus has been isolated from the ultrapure water system of a Hungarian power plant (Tó th et al. 2012) . In the present study, we focused on the characterization and classification, using a polyphasic approach, of strain AMV4 T , which was isolated from a mud volcano (Vandamme et al., 1996) and propose the affiliation of strain AMV4 T to the genus Aquipuribacter as a distinct species. T was isolated from a soil sample collected from a mud volcano on Baratang Island, Middle Andamans, India on 20 February 2009. The sample that yielded strain AMV4 T had a pH of 7.5. For isolation of bacteria, 100 mg of the soil sample suspended in 1 % saline water was plated on ZoBell marine agar (MA) plates (ZoBell, 1941) and incubated at 37 8C for 15 days. Out of the two pale-orange colonies that shared 100 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, one was selected and characterized. Sub-cultivation of the isolate was carried out on marine agar medium at 37 8C. Stock cultures of the isolate in marine broth with 10 % (v/v) glycerol were preserved at 280 8C.  T was characterized simultaneously with A. hungaricus IV-75 T , which was obtained from Dr E. M. Tó th (Tó th et al., 2012) . Cell morphology and motility were observed by using phase-contrast microscopy (Eclipse, 80i; Nikon, Japan). Morphology was also observed using transmission electron microscopy [TEM (H7600; Hitachi)]. Specimens for TEM were negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid. Motility was also assessed on tryptic soy agar (TSA) containing (l ) a pancreatic digest of casein (17 g), a papaic digest of soyabean meat (3 g), NaCl (20 g), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (2.5 g), glucose (2.5 g) and agar (0.4 g) and on a motility Indole Lysine agar slant (HIM-EDIA). Growth at 4, 10, 20, 30, 37, 40, 45 and 50 8C was ascertained using marine broth (MB) and salt tolerance [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 % (w/v) NaCl] was determined using nutrient broth (NB) containing (l ) peptone (5 g) and beef extract (3 g). Growth of strain AMV4 T at pH 5, 6, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11 and 12 was assessed on MB buffered with citric acid/NaOH (for pH 5 and 6), NaHPO 4 -Na 2 HPO 4 (for pH 7 and 8), glycine/NaOH (for pH 9 and 10) or Tris/ HCl or NaOH (for pH 11 and 12). Biochemical characteristics, such as activity of oxidase, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, nitrate reduction, hydrolysis of aesculin, gelatin, ONPG, starch, Tweens 20, 40, 60 and 80, carbon source assimilation, H 2 S production and the sensitivity to 19 different antibiotics using the disc diffusion method with commercially available discs (HIMEDIA) were determined by previously described methods (Lányí, 1987; Smibert & Krieg, 1994) . Anaerobic growth was assessed: (i) in screw-capped tubes containing ZoBell marine broth with 0.05 % sodium ascorbate filled up to the top of the tube without an air gap and, (ii) by streaking the cultures on marine anaerobic agar (HIMEDIA) slants and flushing with N 2 to expel all the air. Biochemical characteristics were assessed using the Hi25 Enterobacteriaceae identification kit and the HiCarbohydrate kit parts A, B and C (HIMEDIA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Biochemical and enzymic characterization of the strains was also performed using Vitek 2 GN (bioMérieux) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that sterile 2.0 % (w/v) NaCl was used to prepare the inoculum. Standardization of the physiological age of strains AMV4 T and A. hungaricus IV-75 T was carried out based on the protocol (http://www.microbialid.com/PDF/TechNote_101. pdf) given by the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI). For cellular fatty acid analysis, strains AMV4 T and A. hungaricus IV-75 T were grown on MA plates at 37 8C for 7 and 4 days respectively. Cellular fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were obtained from cells by saponification, methylation and extraction following the protocol of MIDI. Cellular FAMEs were separated by GC (Agilent 6890) and analysed using the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI-6890 with database TSBA6) according to the protocol described by the Sherlock Microbial Identification System. The cell-wall diamino acid of strain AMV4 T was extracted from whole-cell hydrolysates and analysed as described by Hasegawa et al. (1983) . Polar lipids were extracted following the method of Bligh & Dyer (1959) and analysed by two-dimensional TLC followed by spraying with appropriate detection reagents (Komagata & Suzuki, 1987) . Menaquinones were extracted as described by Collins et al. (1977) and analysed by HPLC (Groth et al., 1997) . Menaquinones and polar lipids were analysed using freezedried cells. The polar lipids were identified as phospho-, amino-or glyco-lipids by spraying with molybdenum blue, ninhydrin, and a-naphthol reagents, respectively. The DNA of strain AMV4 T was isolated according to the procedure of Marmur (1961) and the G+C content was determined from melting point (T m ) curves (Sly et al., 1986) obtained by using a Lambda 2 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) equipped with the Templab 2.0 software package (Perkin Elmer). Escherichia coli DH5-a DNA was used as the standard in determining the DNA G+C content. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, DNA was prepared using a microbial DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories) and sequenced as described previously (Lane, 1991) . The resultant, almost complete sequence, of the 16S rRNA gene (1492 nt) was subjected to BLAST sequence similarity searches (Altschul et al., 1990 ) and the EzTaxon-e server (Kim et al., 2012) was used to identify the nearest taxa. 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strains of A. hungaricus and type species of the genera within the family Intrasporangiaceae were downloaded from the NCBI database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and aligned using the CLUSTAL W program within the MEGA5 package (Tamura et al., 2011) . Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood methods using the MEGA5 package (Tamura et al., 2011) and the resultant tree topologies were evaluated based on 1000 bootstrap resamplings. DNA-DNA hybridization was performed by the membrane filter method, as described previously (Shivaji et al., 1992; Tourova & Antonov, 1988) . T were Gram-stain-positive, nonmotile, coccoid shaped, 1.5-2.0 mm in diameter and they multiplied by binary fission (Fig. 1) . Colonies, after 7 days, were circular, 0.2-0.6 mm in diameter, smooth, shiny, pale orange, translucent and raised with entire margins on marine agar. The strain was positive for catalase, lysine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase activities and negative for oxidase and phenylalanine deaminase activities and indole production. Strain AMV4 T reduced nitrate and T exhibited growth between 37-45 8C, at pH 7-8 and tolerated 3 % (w/v) NaCl. Studies of growth at temperatures below 37 8C and above 45 8C, below pH 7 and above pH 8 and below 1 % (w/v) NaCl and above 3 % (w/v) NaCl were repeated three times (to confirm the results) and no growth was observed even after several weeks of incubation. Strain AMV4 T exhibited optimum growth at 37 8C, at pH 7.5 and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Other phenotypic characteristics of strain AMV4 T are listed in the species description and in Table 1 . The cellular fatty acid composition of strain AMV4 T showed branched, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, with a high abundance of iso-C 15 : 0 , anteiso-C 15 : 0 , C 16 : 0 , anteiso-C 16 : 0 , C 18 : 1 v9c and C 18 : 3 v6,9,12c (Table 2) . When compared with A. hungaricus IV-75 T , strain AMV4 T showed a very similar composition with respect to the major fatty acids ( Table 2 ). The diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain AMV4 T was mDpm. The predominant respiratory quinone of strain AMV4 T was MK-10(H 4 ). The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified glycolipid, two unidentified phospholipids and five unidentified lipids (Fig.  S1 , available in the online Supplementary Material). Strain AMV4 T showed similar chemotaxonomic characteristics (diamino acid, quinone, major polar lipids and fatty acids) to A. hungaricus IV-75 T (Tó th et al., 2012). The DNA G+C content of strain AMV4 T was 74.3 mol%. In the phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain AMV4 T appeared most closely related to A. hungaricus (97 % sequence similarity). Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the maximum-likelihood (Fig. 2) and neighbour-joining (Fig. S2) methods. The trees revealed a clear affiliation of the novel isolate with species of the genus Aquipuribacter; it clustered with the type strain of A. hungaricus and appeared distinct from the clades representing the other genera of the family Intrasporangiaceae; DNA-DNA hybridization between strains AMV4 T and A. hungaricus IV-75 T showed a relatedness value of 28 %. This value is much lower than 70 %, so it confirms that strain AMV4 T is not a member of the same species as A. hungaricus IV-75 T (Wayne et al., 1987) . We found that, when compared with suborders described within the order Actinomycetales, strain AMV4 T and A. hungaricus had many unique 16S rRNA gene signature nucleotides, which were reflected particularly in fourteen different positions: The characteristics that differentiate strain AMV4 T from A. hungaricus T are given in Table 1 . The data obtained from the phenotypic characterization support strain AMV4 T occupying a separate position in the 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic tree for the class Actinobacteria. Based on the results described above, it is concluded that strain AMV4 T represents a novel species of the genus Aquipuribacter, for which the name Aquipuribacter nitratireducens sp. nov. is proposed.

2829093,Differences in Life-Histories Refute Ecological Equivalence of Cryptic Species and Provide Clues to the Origin of Bathyal Halomonhystera (Nematoda),"The discovery of morphologically very similar but genetically distinct species complicates a proper understanding of the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Cryptic species have been frequently observed to co-occur and are thus expected to be ecological equivalent. The marine nematode Halomonhystera disjuncta contains five cryptic species (GD1-5) that co-occur in the Westerschelde estuary. In this study, we investigated the effect of three abiotic factors (salinity, temperature and sulphide) on life-history traits of three cryptic H. disjuncta species (GD1-3). Our results show that temperature had the most profound influence on all life-cycle parameters compared to a smaller effect of salinity. Life-history traits of closely related cryptic species were differentially affected by temperature, salinity and presence of sulphides which shows that cryptic H. disjuncta species are not ecologically equivalent. Our results further revealed that GD1 had the highest tolerance to a combination of sulphides, high salinities and low temperatures. The close phylogenetic position of GD1 to Halomonhystera hermesi, the dominant species in sulphidic sediments of the Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barent Sea, 1280 m depth), indicates that both species share a recent common ancestor. Differential life-history responses to environmental changes among cryptic species may have crucial consequences for our perception on ecosystem functioning and coexistence of cryptic species.","DNA sequencing of multiple independently evolving gene regions has revealed that distinct taxonomic units, previously classified as single species due to a similar morphology, can be distinguished based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequence markers [1, 2] . Such cryptic diversity is almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa and biogeographical regions [2] . However, it has been suggested that cryptic diversity is more common in marine environments because many marine species rely on chemical cues for mate recognition [3] [4] [5] . The co-occurrence of species with highly similar morphologies has been frequently observed [6] [7] [8] and indicates that they are adapted to ecologically similar environments. Similarities in body size and life histories of cryptic species may form important equalizing mechanisms which can minimize average fitness differences between species and, consequently, slow down competitive exclusion [9] . However, these equalizing mechanisms are unlikely to lead to stable coexistence [9, 10] . Stable coexistence of species can only exist if both equalizing-and stabilizing mechanisms, such as fitness differences [9, 11] , niche differentiation and/or density-dependent life history adjustments [12, 13] , are present [14] . Even then, the sufficiency of both mechanisms highly depends on the species composition and the strength of each individual mechanism [9] . To date, ecological characterization of cryptic invertebrate species has focused on nutritional [15] and habitat preferences [16, 17] . However, susceptibility to predation [17, 18] , response to abiotic factors [19] and species-specific symbioses [20] are additional examples of stabilizing mechanisms which may also contribute to stable coexistence of cryptic species. Whether and to what extent this implies that cryptic species are ecologically equivalent remains unknown. In marine sediments, nematodes are usually the most abundant and diverse Metazoa [21, 22] . Cryptic diversity has been reported in marine nematodes belonging to different orders [23] [24] [25] . These cryptic species can exhibit differential dispersal capacities [26] and differential resource use, and environmental factors such as salinity and temperature may affect the outcome of their competitive interactions when they co-occur [27] . However, at this point, we lack any information on if and how life-history traits of cryptic nematode species differ in response to changes in abiotic factors. Such information is, however, important to understand mechanisms driving the coexistence cryptic species, which in turn is crucial to correctly understand the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationship [28] . In this study, we focus on the marine nematode Halomonhystera disjuncta (previously named Geomonhystera disjuncta), a representative of a genus which has a widespread geographical distribution and which has been reported both in shallow-water [23, [29] [30] [31] and in deep-sea environments [32, 33] . In the Westerschelde estuary (located in the Southwestern part of The Netherlands), five cryptic species (GD1-5) of H. disjuncta have been reported based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data; these five species exhibit subtle morphometric differences [23, 34] . Halomonhystera disjuncta has most often been isolated from macroalgal holdfasts and wrack deposits, but has also been frequently observed in the sediment, successfully exploiting organically enriched substrata [21, 35, 36] . In the Westerschelde estuary, the five cryptic species (GD1-5) show sympatric distributions [23] . In view of their mainly intertidal occurrence, these species are subject to strong physical, chemical and biological gradients. Ecological and physiological responses of H. disjuncta from the intertidal zone to changes in salinity, temperature, food quality, food density and heavy metals have been investigated [21, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . However, it is unknown whether the observed broad tolerance to e.g. temperature and heavy metals is the same for different cryptic species. Halomonhystera is also the dominant nematode genus in the sulphide rich bacterial mats of the Nyegga pockmark (Nordic Norwegian margin) [32] and the Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV, Barent Sea slope) [33] , situated at depths of 730 m and 1280 m, respectively. At both locations, fluids escape from the deep-sea floor at lower temperatures and flow rates compared to mid-oceanic ridges, and are, therefore, called cold seeps. The Halomonhystera from both environments were originally identified as H. disjuncta, but the Halomonhystera from the HMMV has morphological and genetic differences compared to the shallowwater H. disjuncta species GD1-5, and has been described as a new species Halomonhystera hermesi [43] . Phylogenetic analysis revealed three intertidal clades (GD1/GD4, GD3, GD2/GD5) and one deep-sea clade Halomonhystera hermesi [44] and showed that H. hermesi is more closely related to GD1 and GD4 than to the other species. A deep-sea invasion from shallow-water regions has hence been hypothesized [44] . Nordic seep colonization from intertidal regions implies that early colonizers had to adapt to low temperatures, higher salinities and the presence of high concentrations of sulphides. If cryptic species of H. disjuncta differ in their tolerance to one or more of these environmental differences, then we could expect that the species with the highest degree of tolerance to bathyal cold seep conditions is phylogenetically closest related to H. hermesi. Here we investigate the effect of three abiotic factors (salinity, temperature and sulphide) on life-history traits of three cryptic H. disjuncta species (GD1, 2 and 3). Each of the three abiotic factors varied from control conditions (salinity of 25 psu, 16uC and no sulphide) to environmental conditions representative of the HMMV (salinity of 34-35 psu, 2uC and hydrogen sulphide concentrations of ca. 1 mM) [45, 46] in a fully crossed factorial design with three salinity levels (25, 29.5 and 34 psu), three temperatures (16, 10 and 4uC) and two sulphide treatments (no sulphide vs. 1 mM). Because these three cryptic species co-occur in the Westerschelde estuary [23] , are phenotypically almost identical [34] , and were isolated from the same species of macroalgae (Fucus vesiculosus), they are expected to show a high degree of ecological equivalence with respect to abiotic environmental factors. In contrast, if differences in life history traits would be observed, then we would expect GD1 to better tolerate bathyal cold seep conditions than GD2 and GD3, because it is phylogenetically more closely related to H. hermesi compared to GD2-3. This prediction follows the rationale of the phylogenetic niche conservatism theory (PNC). PNC is the tendency of lineages to retain their niche-related traits through speciation events and over long evolutionary periods [47, 48] . Consequently, phylogenetically closely related species are expected to be ecologically similar [49] .  Halomonhystera disjuncta species GD1 and GD3 were retrieved from decaying Fucus vesiculosus from the Paulina tidal flat in the Westerschelde estuary (The Netherlands, 51u 209 56.7999 N, 3u 439 29.5699 E), while GD2 was isolated from the same decaying macroalgae species from a different location (Kruispolderhaven, 51u 219 34.3599 N, 4u 59 52.0299 E) in the same estuary. All species were collected in April 2012. Permission for the field work was issued by the Provincie Zeeland, the Netherlands (Directie Ruimte, Milieu en Water). Pieces of algae were inoculated on Petri dishes filled with 0.8% nutrient:bacto agar (ratio of 1/7) prepared in artificial seawater [50] with a salinity of 25 psu and placed at a constant temperature of 16uC. These conditions were chosen based on the temperature and salinity values observed in the field locations from where the species were isolated and are perfectly suited for cultivation of H. disjuncta species. Monospecific cultures were established by transferring a single gravid female to a new Petri dish (5.5 cm inner diameter) containing the same agar medium. By doing so, we reduced population variation, which was necessary to ensure monospecific status of the cultures. This, however, implies that differences observed here between cryptic species may partly reflect individual and/or population level differences, for instance resulting from local adaptation, rather than consistent differences between species. The monospecific cultures were maintained at the same temperature (16uC) with frozen-and-thawed Escherichia coli K12 as a food source. Species identity and monospecificity of the cultures was confirmed by PCR and sequencing the ITS gene of ten nematodes per culture. Primers, thermo-cycling conditions and GenBank accession numbers can be found in [23] . Nematodes for the experiment were harvested from the stock cultures. To test the effect of three abiotic factors (salinity, temperature and sulphide) between cryptic species, a fully crossed design with four factors: salinity (25, 29.5 and 34 psu), temperature (16, 10 and 4uC), species (GD1, GD2 and GD3) and sulphide (present or absent) was set up. For each treatment x species combination, four replicates were prepared, resulting in 216 microcosms. The experiment was conducted on experimental microcosms which consisted of Petri dishes (3.5 cm i.d.) containing 1.5 ml 0.8% nutrient:bacto agar (1/7). Because stock cultures are maintained at a salinity of 25 psu and 16uC, these conditions served as a control. The sulphidic media were prepared from the same agar medium as above, but to which we added sodium thiosulphate (Na 2 S 2 O 3 ) and sodium sulphide (Na 2 S) in a final concentration of 1 mM for both reagents. Lastly, to each microcosm 350 ml E. coli K12 (ca. 7.6610 8 cells/ml) was added as a food source, which is sufficient for the duration of the experiment. Each replicate microcosm received 10 nematodes. We randomly picked out six female and four male nematodes, in accordance with the sex ratio in the stock cultures. Nematodes were considered adult when all parts of the reproductive system were clearly visible. Only nematodes which had just reached adulthood were randomly selected. Immediately after addition of the nematodes to the Petri dishes, we checked them carefully for specimens which died, were injured or immobilized during manipulation. These were replaced by new specimens of the same sex. The Petri dishes were then closed with parafilm, maintained in temperature-controlled incubators without light, and the experiment was started. The amounts of eggs, juveniles and adults were counted daily. In addition, we observed mortality of inoculated nematodes. Young F1-adults are easily distinguishable from F0-adults, up to a few days after they reached adulthood, because of their smaller body size. Therefore, the experiment was stopped before F1-adults started to deposit eggs and/or when we were no longer able to distinguish new adults from the inoculated nematodes. This was after ca. 13, 18 and 38 days at 16uC, 10uC and 4uC, respectively. Hence, our results encompassed a single nematode generation. Four response variables were used for statistical analysis: (1) minimum time until first egg(s) deposition (MEGD) is the minimum time (in days) from the inoculation of the nematodes until we observed the first egg(s); (2) the minimum time for embryonic development (MEMD) was calculated by subtracting MEGD from the time at which we observed the first juvenile; (3) the minimum time for the development of juveniles into adults (MJD) was calculated by subtracting the time at which the first juvenile was observed from the time at which the first F1 adult was detected; (4) the minimum generation time (MGT) was recorded as the time from the start of the experiment (parental generation) until the first new adult (filial generation) was observed. In addition, fertility was approximated by summing the counts of eggs, juveniles and new adults at the end of the incubation. Fertility was expressed per parental female by dividing total offspring (eggs, juveniles and new adults) of a microcosm, by the number of inoculated females. Furthermore, mortality of the inoculated nematodes was monitored. We, therefore, created an additional variable, the minimum adult lifespan (MALS), which corresponds to the day at which we observed the death of at least one inoculated adult nematode. It must be noted that the experiment for some treatments was stopped before any mortality of inoculated nematodes was observed. Small standard deviations and visual inspection of our data revealed that MALS was not importantly influenced by stochasticity, i.e. the incidental death of an inoculated individual in random replicates and treatments. Because our data did not meet the assumptions for parametric variance analysis, even after transformation, a Permutational Based Multivariate Analysis of Variance [51] , on the basis of Euclidean distances with 9999 permutations, was used. In comparison to ANOVA/MANOVA, both assuming normal distributions and, implicitly, Euclidean distance, PERMANOVA works with any distance measure that is appropriate to the data, and uses permutations to make it distribution free [51] . Each analysis was performed using a fully crossed PERMANOVA design with four fixed factors (salinity, temperature, sulphide presence and species). All analyses were performed within PRIMER v6 with PERMANOVA+ add-on software [51] . Because of the relatively limited level of replication (4 or 3, the latter in few cases where we observed agar dehydration as a result of an imperfect Petri dish closure), a Monte Carlo test was performed. The components of variation, estimated by PERMA-NOVA, were used to attribute the amount of variation to different factors and interaction terms [52] . A high component value corresponds with a high relative importance of the respective term in the model [51] . Pairwise comparisons were performed on the full dataset and p-values can be found in the supplementary information. If the four-way interaction was significant, we were unable to reliably interpret two-way and three-way interaction terms. In these cases we selected subsets of our data for which only two or three factors varied. However, we tested these two-and three-way interaction effects for all levels and combinations of the factor(s) that were kept constant. PERMDISP [53] was executed to test the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions in order to discriminate between real location or factor effects and effects explained by differences in dispersion for the significant factors. Figures were made with Graphpad prism 5.  MGT is the sum of the minimum time until first egg(s) deposition (MEGD), the minimum time for embryonic development (MEMD) and the minimum time for the development of juveniles into adults (MJD). A significant four-way interaction effect on MGT was found (PERMANOVA; p = 0.0001, Table 1 ) which was not caused by differences in multivariate dispersion (F 43, 109 = 0.408, p = 0.9994). The estimation of the components of variation showed that temperature was the most important factor influencing MGT (Table 2) . MGT increased with decreasing temperature (T) for all species (Sp ; Table 3 ). When species are compared in presence and absence of sulphide (S), GD2 generally had the shortest MGT at 16uC and at 4uC. Except at cold seep conditions (at a temperature of 4uC, a salinity of 34 psu and in the presence of sulphide), GD1 had a significantly shorter MGT than GD2 (p = 0.0156, Table S1 ). A significant shorter MGT for GD1, in comparison to GD2-3, was also observed at 10uC (all p-values ,0.0018, Table S1 ). The difference in MGT between species in relation to temperature was underlined by a significant Sp x T interaction (all p-values = 0.0001, Table 1 ) independent of salinity and sulphide addition. Increasing the salinity (Sal) resulted in an increase of MGT. The response to higher salinities is more pronounced for GD3 (2-10 days) than for GD1-2 (0-6 days; Table 3 ), in the absence of sulphide. This observation was supported by a significant Sp x Sal interaction at all temperatures (all p-values ,0.0468, Table 1 ). The effect of adding sulphide to the cultures resulted in the death of all inoculated GD3 nematodes during the first two minutes and no life-history traits could, therefore, be determined. The addition of sulphide resulted in a significant increase in MGT of 1-10 days for GD1 and GD2 at 10uC and 4uC (all p-values , 0.0138, Table S2 ) at all salinity levels (Table 3) . GD3 was the only species showing an ovoviviparous reproduction strategy throughout the whole experiment. Therefore, we did not include GD3 in the MEGD dataset. For the two other species, abiotic factors significantly affected MEGD (four-way PERMA-NOVA; p = 0.0065, Table 1 ). Homogeneity of multivariate dispersions was observed (F 35, 89 = 0.736, p = 0.8453). The estimation of the components of variation revealed that temperature is the most import factor influencing MEGD (Table 2) . A strong significant increase in MEGD from 10uC to 4uC (all pvalues ,0.0003, Table S3 ) was observed for both species (Figure 1 ). This increase was observed at all salinity levels and in presence/absence of sulphide. Increasing salinity usually resulted in a significant increase in MEGD for both species (p-values in Table S4 ) and was most pronounced at 4uC for both species, supported by a significant T x Sal interaction term (all p-values , 0.0026, Table 1 ). The effects of sulphide were heavily dependent on temperature for both species (significant S x T interaction term, all p-values , 0.0003 at all salinity levels, Table 1 ). Addition of sulphide resulted in a significant decrease (all p-values ,0.0031, Table S2 ) in MEGD of GD1 at 16uC, ( Figure 1A, 1C) but not of GD2 ( Figure 1B, 1C) . The observed difference between species was corroborated by significant S x Sp interaction term 16uC at all salinity levels (p-values ,0.0383, Table 1 ). At 10uC, adding sulphide resulted in a significant increase in MEGD of GD1 (all pvalues ,0.0429, table S2) but not for GD2. At the lowest temperature (4uC), adding sulphide resulted in an increase in MEGD for both species (all p-values ,0.0134, Table S2 ). Due to GD3's ovoviviparous reproduction strategy we were unable to estimate MEMD for this species. Similar to the MEGD, a significant four-way interaction (p = 0.0002, Table 1 ) and homogeneity of multivariate dispersions were found (F 1,123 = 0.042, p = 0.8381). The estimates of components of variation revealed that temperature and the interaction term Sp x T were the most important effects (Table 2) . Comparable with MEGD, lowering the temperature increased MEMD (Figure 2A-D) . Both GD1 and GD2 had a stable MEMD between 16uC and 10uC, while a significant increase was observed at 4uC (all p-values ,0.0124, Table S3 ). This increase was much more pronounced for GD1 than for GD2, underlined by a significant Sp x T interaction effect (all p-values ,0.001, Table 1 ) independent of salinity and sulphide. Increasing the salinity had no significant effect on MEMD for GD1, but had an opposite effect on MEMD for GD2 at 4uC between different sulphide treatments ( Figure 2B, 2D) . This observation is supported by a significant S x Sp x Sal interaction component at 4uC (p-value = 0.001, Table 1 ). The addition of sulphide had no further consistent or opposing effects on MEMD. Interestingly, at bathyal cold seep conditions, GD2 had a significantly shorter MEMD than GD1 (p,0.0029, Table S1 ). MJD showed a significant four-way interaction effect (p = 0.0433, Table 1 ) and homogeneity of multivariate dispersions was found (F 43,109 = 0.870, p = 0.6917). According to the estimates (Table 2) . Lowering temperature resulted in a significant increase in MJD ( Figure 3A -E) for both GD2 and GD3 independent of other factors (all p-values ,0.0189, Table S3 ). GD1 also showed a significant increase in MJD from 10uC and 16uC to 4uC (all pvalues ,0.0024, Table S3; Figure 3A , 3B) but not between 16uC to 10uC (all p-values .0.1092, Table S3 ). This differential effect of temperature changes on species was confirmed by a significant Sp x T interaction effects at all salinity and sulphide levels (all p-values ,0.0003, Table 1 ). Interestingly, GD3 did not produce offspring at 16uC and a salinity of 34 psu. Even though female nematodes had eggs inside the uterus, which developed into juveniles, they were never deposited. Our data also shows that at 4uC the effect of salinity interacted with the addition of sulphide and was more pronounced for GD2 than for GD1 (significant S x Sp x Sal interaction term, p = 0.0133, Table 1 ). In addition, at bathyal cold seep conditions GD1 had a significantly shorter MJD compared to GD2 (p = 0.0009, Table S1 ).  The four-way interaction of MALS was not significant (p = 0.3177, Table 1 ) and homogeneity of multivariate dispersions (F 41, 99 = 1.085, p = 0.3638) was observed. Some data points are missing because in some treatments we stopped the experiment before any mortality of inoculated nematodes occurred. A decrease in temperature generally resulted in a significant increase in MALS for all species (Figure 4) . However, no significant increase was observed for GD1 from 16uC to 10uC (all p-values .0.1167, Table S3 ), in contrast with GD2 and GD3 (all p-values ,0.0010, Table S3 ). At 4uC, in the absence of sulphide, GD2 and GD3 had the shortest and largest MALS, respectively. This difference between species was supported by a significant Sp x T interaction effect at all salinity and sulphide levels (all p-values ,0.0002, Table 1 ). Addition of sulphide resulted in the death of all inoculated GD3 nematodes within minutes. For both other species the addition of sulphide commonly decreased MALS. At 4uC and at bathyal cold seep conditions, GD1 had a higher MALS than GD2 (all p-values ,0.0023, Table S1, Figure 4D -E). Sulphide-induced mortality decreased with decreasing temperature: in the presence of sulphide and at a temperature of 16uC, ca. 99% of both inoculated and new adults of GD1 and GD2 died after one generation. However, this high mortality rate was decreased to ca. 50% at 10uC and was negligible at 4uC. Variances were homogeneous (F 44, 112 = 0.526, p = 0.9931) and a significant four-way interaction effect was found (p = 0.0001, Table 1 ). Estimates of components of variation revealed that most factors and interactions had an effect on the OS (Table 2) with temperature being the most important one. Consequently, subdatasets were analyzed to better understand effects of single factors and their two-and three-way interactions. All cryptic species had the highest OS at 16uC in the absence of sulphide and at a salinity of 25 psu (except for GD2, Figure 5 ), and the lowest OS at 4uC in the presence of sulphide and at a salinity of 34 psu. A reduction in OS was observed for all species with decreasing temperature, increasing salinity and addition of sulphide. However, the declination in OS for GD2 was clearly more influenced by temperature than for GD1 and GD3 as was supported by a significant Sp x T interaction component (all pvalues = 0.0001, Table 1 ). Variation in OS, caused by temperature and salinity, was much lower in GD3 in the absence of sulphide (pvalue Sp x T x Sal = 0.0001, Table 1 ), compared to the two other species. However, no offspring was observed at 16uC and a salinity of 34 psu. Generally, adding sulphide resulted in a reduction in OS for both GD1 and GD2. Furthermore, GD1 produced significantly more OS than GD2 at bathyal cold seep conditions (p = 0.006, Table S1 ).  The success of nematodes in marine environments relates to their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions [54, 55] . Because the three cryptic H. disjuncta species commonly occur on decaying macroalgae in the high intertidal, they are regularly exposed to short-and long-term fluctuations in abiotic factors such as salinity and temperature. Moreover, they can be exposed to hydrogen sulphide produced by sulphate reducing bacteria thriving on rotting macroalgae [56] . In summary, the three species were expected to show wide tolerances to the abiotic factors tested in this study. In our experiments, temperature had the strongest impact on life-history traits of all cryptic species. The minimum generation time and adult life span increased with decreasing temperature, which is most likely caused by lower metabolic rates at lower temperatures [57] . Faster generation times at higher temperatures shorten the vulnerable period of the embryo, thus preventing embryonic deformities and/or arrest [54] , and allow species to rapidly increase in numbers during favorable episodes, a common feature of opportunistic species [58] . Halomonhystera disjuncta is indeed an opportunistic species capable of quickly colonizing suitable patches such as new algal deposits [35] . Salinity, on the other hand, had a relatively minor impact on the life-history traits studied here. The salinity and temperature ranges tested in our study reflect fluctuations in their natural habitat and indicate a strong capacity for adaptation to natural fluctuations, which is consistent with previous studies on other marine nematodes from very similar intertidal habitats [59, 60] . Cryptic H. disjuncta species are not ecologically equivalent Co-occurrence of cryptic species raises questions regarding their ecological similarity and the mechanisms influencing their coexistence [15, 19] . The three cryptic species studied here have a very similar morphology, have sympatric occurrences and all thrive on the same habitat, i.e. decaying macroalgae in the Westerschelde estuary. We may, therefore, expect that they have evolved comparable adaptations to similar environmental conditions (equalizing mechanism). The general response to temperature and salinity, i.e. an increase in time for life-history traits and a decrease in number of offspring with lower temperatures and higher salinities, was indeed similar in all cryptic species and points towards ecological equivalence. However, our results also uncovered specific life-history responses to different abiotic factors. Lifehistory traits of GD1 were more stable in the temperature interval between 10uC and 16uC than those of GD2. Interestingly, GD3 did not survive in the presence of sulphides, whereas GD1 and GD2 not only survived but also reproduced and developed normal offspring for at least one generation. These results reveal that cryptic species are not completely ecologically equivalent. Our results might be partly biased because a single gravid female was used to generate the monospecific cultures. Nevertheless, the observed differential effects of abiotic factors on life-history traits, may provide important stabilizing mechanisms facilitating the coexistence of cryptic species [9] . In addition to its sensitivity to sulphides, the most obvious difference between GD3 and the other two cryptic species was its ovoviviparous reproduction strategy. Intrauterine egg hatching (ovoviviparity) allows a more secure survival and early development of offspring and can be an adaptation strategy in toxic environmental conditions [61] . The low number of GD3 offspring compared to GD1 and GD2 suggests a trade-off between the reproductive strategy and fecundity. This is further supported by the observation that the fecundity of GD3 was less affected by changes in salinity and temperature than that of GD1 and GD2. In addition, the minimum adult life span was always the highest for GD3 at all temperatures. The comparatively smaller impact of temperature on GD3 could also in part explain its occurrence throughout the year and its high relative abundance in winter in the Westerschelde estuary [23] . In contrast to GD3, GD2 was often absent in winter but had the highest relative abundance in spring [23] . Our experimental data revealed that GD2 had the fastest minimum generation time at 16uC and the highest number of offspring at 10uC and 16uC. In spite of this, its number of offspring was more sensitive to temperature changes. These observations may explain the high relative abundance of GD2 in spring and its disappearance in winter. Differential responses of nematodes to abiotic factors can also affect interspecific interactions [27, 62] and dispersal capacities [26] , which could in turn facilitate coexistence. Recently, significant differences in resource use among sympatric cryptic nematode species have been demonstrated, and other potentially discriminating biotic/abiotic factors, such as differential susceptibility to predation and competitive interaction with other taxa, should be taken into account to fully grasp the coexistence and spatial/temporal distribution patterns of these cryptic species because the small morphological differences between GD1-3 [34] may not be sufficient to predict ecological segregation [63] . It is often suggested that current deep-sea biodiversity has largely resulted from recurrent invasions from bathyal and abyssal depths followed by speciation [64] . The existence of morphologically and/or genetically close relatives from intertidal and deepsea environments [65] tends to support this contention. In an evolutionary context, understanding the adaptations which have allowed deep-sea colonization is an important prerequisite. GD1 is phylogenetically most closely related to the Nordic seep nematode Halomonhystera hermesi [44] and, therefore, shares a most recent common ancestor with H. hermesi. In the reduced environment of the Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV), organisms encounter stress levels which selectively favor sulphide tolerant species [66] . In view of the 100% mortality of GD3 in the sulphide treatments, it is very unlikely that this species successfully colonized the HMMV. It must, however, be mentioned that GD3 did survive under lower concentrations of sodium thiosulphate and sodium sulphide (up to 0.25 mM) in a preliminary test. Such a mild exposure could increase resistance to subsequent higher doses (hormesis) of the same or different stressors [67] . Nevertheless, GD3 was unable to cope with high concentrations of sulphides. GD1 and GD2, by contrast, survive and produce offspring at the sulphide concentrations tested here. Such a high sulphide tolerance may be an advantage for colonizing reduced environments [66] . Species living in sulphidic environments often have ecto-or endosymbionts which could either serve as a food source and/or play a role in sulphur detoxification [68, 69] . In addition, sulphur inclusions could temporarily reduce the toxic effect of H 2 S [70] . However, no signs of bacterial symbionts in H. hermesi were detected [45] , and we did not observe sulphur inclusions in GD1-2. Interestingly, however, low temperature had a positive effect on the survival of GD1 and GD2 (but not GD3) under sulphide exposure. Similarly, low temperatures reduced the mortality rate of H. disjuncta subjected to toxic chromium concentrations [40] . Hence, the low temperatures in the deep sea may have been an important factor enabling Halomonhystera to cope with otherwise toxic sulphide concentrations. Our results further reveal that GD1 had a higher number of offspring at bathyal cold seep conditions (salinity of 34 psutemperature of 4uC -presence of sulphides) than GD2. In addition, GD1 had the fastest minimum generation time and a longer minimum life span than GD2 at these conditions. This implies that GD1 is more resistant to a combination of sulphides, low temperature and higher salinities, and is in agreement with the close phylogenetic relationship between GD1 and H. hermesi, supporting the idea that it could have successfully colonized Nordic seeps. We have shown that life-histories of cryptic were differentially affected by changes in temperature, salinity and presence of sulphides. These observed differences imply that closely related cryptic H. disjuncta species are not necessarily ecologically equivalent and that abiotic factors can strongly impact their lifehistory traits, which in turn can affect their coexistence. Our results further indicate that Halomonhystera hermesi and GD1 share a common ancestor as the latter appears to be more resistant to bathyal seep conditions compared to other cryptic species. The observed limited ecological equivalence among cryptic species may have important repercussions for our understanding of the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [71] .

9307972,"Prokaryotic diversity of an active mud volcano in the Usu City of Xinjiang, China.","The Usu mud volcanoes are the largest group of terrestrial mud volcanoes in China. The volcanoes are located in a typical arid and semi-arid region, and the group consists of 36 erupting active mud volcanoes. In this study, the prokaryotic diversity and community structure in the sediment of an active mud volcano were investigated by constructing bacterial and archaeal clone libraries of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 100 bacterial and 100 archaeal clones were analysed and found to comprise 11 and 7 distinct phylotypes, respectively. The bacterial phylotypes were classified into three phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria). Of these, Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial group, with Deltaproteobacteria dominating the sediment community, and these were affiliated with the order Desulfuromonadales. The archaeal phylotypes were all closely related to uncultivated species, and the majority of the members were related to the orders Methanosarcinales and Halobacteriales of the Euryarchaeota originating from methane hydrate bearing or alkaline sediments. The rest of the archaeal phylotypes belonged to the phylum Crenarchaeota, with representatives from similar habitats. These results suggested that a large number of novel microbial groups and potential methanogenesis may exist in this unique ecosystem.",N/A,Hong-Mei Yang,2012,21656823,10.1002/jobm.201100074
16773456,"Choline and N,N-Dimethylethanolamine as Direct Substrates for Methanogens","Choline (N,N,N-trimethylethanolamine), which is widely distributed in membrane lipids and is a component of sediment biota, has been shown to be utilized anaerobically by mixed prokaryote cultures to produce methane but not by pure cultures of methanogens. Here, we show that five recently isolated Methanococcoides strains from a range of sediments (Aarhus Bay, Denmark; Severn Estuary mudflats at Portishead, United Kingdom; Darwin Mud Volcano, Gulf of Cadiz; Napoli mud volcano, eastern Mediterranean) can directly utilize choline for methanogenesis producing ethanolamine, which is not further metabolized. Di- and monomethylethanolamine are metabolic intermediates that temporarily accumulate. Consistent with this, dimethylethanolamine was shown to be another new growth substrate, but monomethylethanolamine was not. The specific methanogen inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) inhibited methane production from choline. When choline and trimethylamine are provided together, diauxic growth occurs, with trimethylamine being utilized first, and then after a lag (∼7 days) choline is metabolized. Three type strains of Methanococcoides (M. methylutens, M. burtonii, and M. alaskense), in contrast, did not utilize choline. However, two of them (M. methylutens and M. burtonii) did metabolize dimethylethanolamine. These results extend the known substrates that can be directly utilized by some methanogens, giving them the advantage that they would not be reliant on bacterial syntrophs for their substrate supply.","n sediments, terminal oxidation processes show a vertical sequence which follows the decreasing redox potentials of the respective electron acceptors. Aerobic respiration is present at the sediment surface, followed by nitrate and metal reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis (19) . A more positive redox potential allows a more efficient use of the electron donor and consequently a lower threshold concentration for electron donors (7) . For example, sulfate reducers can efficiently use hydrogen or acetate at lower concentration and therefore can easily outcompete methanogens (15, 18) . There are, however, exceptions to this vertical zonation. Methanogenic archaea have been detected in significant numbers in the upper sediment layers by cultivationbased (8) and molecular methods (26, 27, 34) as well as directly by in situ methanogenic activity measurements (6, 14, 20, 22) . The occurrence and activity of methanogens in these layers despite the presence of relatively high sulfate concentrations has been explained by the use of noncompetitive substrates consumed exclusively by methanogens (13, 21, 35) . These are typically C 1 compounds, such as methanol and methylated nitrogen (methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine), or sulfur compounds (methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide). Other N-methylated amines bearing a larger side chain, such as ethanolamine in N-methylethanolamine and choline (N,N,N-trimethylethanolamine), have not been shown to support growth of methanogen pure cultures (9, 11, 29) ; in contrast, they can be degraded by sulfate reducers (2, 9, 30) . This is supported by environmental studies which showed a stimulation of methanogenic activity upon choline or glycine betaine addition but also a simultaneous increase in sulfate reduction, suggesting a two-step degradation pathway involving a sulfate reducer (or fermenter) releasing trimethylamine that serves as a substrate for methanogenesis (9, 11, 13) . In the present study, we demonstrate the methanogenic utilization of choline and N,N-dimethylethanolamine by pure cultures of methanogens affiliated with the genus Methanococcoides. The potential implications of this novel methanogenic pathway will be discussed. T . The other strains were newly isolated on methylamine (Table 1) using deep-agar shake tubes (23) or dilution-to-extinction series. All cultures were incubated at 25°C.  Cultivation and media. For enrichments, isolation, strain maintenance, and initial experiments, a bicarbonate-buffered and FeS-reduced artificial seawater medium was used (28) (33) . After autoclaving, the medium was cooled under a N 2 -CO 2 mixture (80/20, vol/vol). To the cold medium 10 ml of a solution of 10 vitamins (3) and 30 ml · liter Ϫ1 of a 1 M NaHCO 3 solution were added from sterile stocks. Finally, the medium was reduced by addition of Na 2 S and acid FeCl 2 solutions to final concentrations of 1.5 and 0.5 mmol ·; liter Ϫ1 , respectively. The pH of reduced medium was adjusted to 7.2 to 7.4 with sterile HCl or Na 2 CO 3 if necessary. For enrichment and isolation, 10 mmol methylamine per liter was added. Sterile substrate stocks were produced by dissolving the compound in N 2 gassed water and autoclaving them under a N 2 atmosphere in vials tightly sealed with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco, Vineland, NJ). To increase the analytical performance and separation during cation chromatographic analysis of methylamines, choline, and ethanolamines, growth experiments were conducted in brackish medium ( Because of the presence of FeS in the medium and the formation of cell aggregates by the new strains, growth could not be monitored by increases in optical density. The specific growth rate () during exponential growth was calculated using linear regression from plots of the logarithm of total accumulated methane against time (16, 25) . Growth yield was estimated from the increase in protein contents. Protein concentrations were analyzed by the method of Bradford (5) . Analytical techniques. Headspace methane was measured using a modified Perkin Elmer/Arnel Clarus 500 natural gas analyzer (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Sheldon, CT) fitted with a flame ionization detector (packed column; oven temperature, 110°C; detector temperature, 250°C; the carrier gas was helium). The system was calibrated using a standard gas (Scott Specialty Gases, Plumsteadville, PA). Methane contents in headspace and medium were calculated using the method of Mah et al. (17) using Henry's law constant of 0.03. Total methane contents were converted into concentrations using the medium volume present in the vials to allow better comparison to the substrate concentration determined by ion chromatography. Results were corrected for the decrease in culture medium volume caused by the withdrawal of samples for analysis by ion chromatography. Cations (including ammonium, methylamines, choline, N-methylethanolamine, and ethanolamine) were analyzed using a DX-120 ion chromatograph (Dionex, United Kingdom) fitted with an IonPac CS16 column, a CSRS 300 4-mm suppressor, and a conductivity detector and methanesulfonic acid eluent (32 mM) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml min Ϫ1 (22) . N,N-dimethylethanolamine concentrations had to be measured separately using 25 mM methanesulfonic acid as the eluent. Typically, the relative precision of analyses was better than 2% based upon replicate analyses of standards and samples. Anions (including the organic acids acetate, lactate, and formate) were analyzed on a Dionex ICS-2000 ion chromatography system equipped with an AS50 autosampler (Dionex Ltd.). Chromatographic separation was conducted on two Ionpac AS15 columns in series, and the determination of species was carried out using an anion self-regenerating suppressor (4-mm ASRS-Ultra II) unit in combination with a DS6 heated conductivity cell (Dionex Ltd.). The gradient program was 6 mM KOH (38 min), 16 mM KOH min Ϫ1 to 70 mM (17 min), and 64 mM KOH min Ϫ1 to 6 mM (12 min) (31) . Total DNA was extracted from pure cultures using a Nexttec genomic DNA isolation kit for bacteria (Nexttec GmbH Biotechnologie) by following the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm the purity of strains AM1 and NM1, both the 16S rRNA gene and a portion of the mcrA gene were amplified using PCR primers A8f/A1492r and ME1/ME2, respectively, as previously described (27) . PCR products were purified (Amicon Ultra-0.5 30K; Millipore) and cloned into Escherichia coli (JM109; Promega) using the pGEM-T Easy vector system I (Promega) by following the manufacturer's instructions, and 10 clones for each gene were sequenced using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Strains DM1, PM1, and PM2 were amplified separately using 16S rRNA gene primer 109F/ A1492r or 1Af/A1492r and mcrA gene primers ME1/ME2 as described previously (32) . PCR products were cleaned as described above and sequenced directly using 1Af, 109F, and A1492r or ME1 as appropriate. To confirm the absence of bacteria, all pure cultures were screened for the presence of bacterial 16S rRNA genes using PCR amplification with the primers 27F/1492R as described previously (32) ; no bacterial 16S rRNA genes were detected. The analysis of multiple 16S rRNA gene sequences from strains AM1 and NM1 showed nucleotide variations for 2 and 4 positions, respectively, suggesting multiple copies of the gene within each genome. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. All new sequences reported here have been submitted to the EMBL database under accession numbers HE862406 to HE862410 for 16S rRNA gene sequences and HE862411 to HE862415 for mcrA gene sequences.  Like the three type strains of Methanococcoides species, the five new strains grew well with monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA) as the substrate. Growth rates ranged from 0.63 day Ϫ1 for strain DM1 to 1.18 day Ϫ1 for strain TM1 with MMA. Growth with TMA was faster than with MMA (1.39 day Ϫ1 with TMA and 0.75 day Ϫ1 with MMA for strain AM1). Methane production generally correlated well with the number of methyl groups available. For example, strains AM1 and NM1 produced about three times more methane from TMA (2.32 and 2.06 mol of methane per mol of substrate consumed) than from MMA (0.72 and 0.62 mol of methane per mol of substrate consumed). Strain AM1 produced approximately three times higher protein yields with TMA (2.69 mg protein per mol of TMA) than with MMA (0.84 mg protein per mol of MMA). During growth with DMA, MMA was generally detected as an intermediate but at relatively low concentrations. Similarly, with TMA, both DMA and MMA were produced as metabolic intermediates before being metabolized to methane and ammonium (Fig. 1) . Choline and N,N-dimethylethanolamine as the substrates for methanogenesis. Methylamine-grown cultures were used to inoculate media with choline, N,N-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), N-monomethylethanolamine (MMEA), or ethanolamine as the substrate, and the formation of methane was monitored over time. The different strains showed significant differ- ences with respect to lag phase and methane production rate. In the first choline-amended cultures of strain AM1, methane formation was detected after 1 to 2 weeks but was already detected after 2 to 4 days in subsequent subcultures. Strain AM1 consumed choline within 10 to 15 days. Strain DM1, in contrast, required between 200 and 260 days for the consumption of 4.95 mM choline, producing 4.7 mmol ethanolamine per liter. Strains NM1, PM1, and PM2 produced only very low levels of methane. After 220 days, strain NM1 had demethylated only 2.1 of 9.9 mmol liter Ϫ1 of choline into ethanolamine. After 500 days, strains PM1 and PM2 had consumed 10 mmol liter Ϫ1 choline and produced 2.7 and 3.1 mmol liter Ϫ1 MMEA but not any ethanolamine (DMEA was not analyzed). Cell-free controls did not show any methane formation, and neither did the type strains of the three Methanococcoides spp. even after more than 300 days of incubation with choline as the substrate. DMEA was utilized by all five strains that produced methane from choline, although methane formation was slightly slower. For example, in cultures of strain AM1, methane was detected first after 10 days (in contrast to 2 to 4 days with choline). Surprisingly, DMEA also was consumed by M. methylutens and M. burtonii but not by M. alaskense. None of the strains grew or formed methane with N-methylethanolamine or ethanolamine as sole substrates. Growth with choline by Methanococcoides sp. strain AM1. Of the choline-utilizing strains, Methanococcoides sp. strain AM1 was the fastest and, hence, was studied further. When strain AM1 was grown with choline, there was transient formation of DMEA and MMEA. However, concentrations of both remained relatively low, while concentrations of ethanolamine increased first with choline and then with DMEA and MMEA consumption (Fig. 2) . This indicates that only a fraction of the choline was partially demethylated, in contrast to trimethylamine, which was apparently first completely converted into DMA and MMA before finally being demethylated to ammonium. After choline removal, first DMEA and then MMEA concentrations decreased. While methane formation from DMEA occurred at a rate comparable to that of choline, MMEA turnover was much slower (day 11 onwards in Fig. 2 ). Interestingly, with MMEA as the sole substrate no methane was formed, even after 300 days of incubation. The maximum growth rate with choline as a substrate was 0.74 day Ϫ1 . The formation of methane from choline was inhibited by 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES). In cultures grown with MMA, DMA, TMA, or choline, the amount of methane produced was slightly lower than the theoretical value (Table 2 ). This can partly be explained by the assimilation of carbon into cell biomass, although it may be possible that some methane was lost during sampling. The highest growth yield as g dry weight per methyl group consumed was obtained with choline, followed by dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and methylamine. Impact of trimethylamine on methanogenesis from choline by Methanococcoides sp. strain AM1. Two experiments were conducted to find out which substrate is preferred by strain AM1, choline or trimethylamine. In the first experiment, choline and trimethylamine were both added at the start of the experiment. Strain AM1 showed diauxic growth by consuming trimethyl- amine completely before starting to use choline as a substrate for methanogenesis (Fig. 3) , with methane formation from TMA being significantly faster than from choline. In a second experiment, trimethylamine was added to cultures already growing with choline. Surprisingly, there was no obvious change in growth rate (as estimated from methane concentration) after TMA addition (Fig. 4) , suggesting simultaneous use of both substrates. However, as can be seen from the presence of intermediates (Fig. 4B) , MMEA was formed before TMA was added, but the concentration remained constant at about 0.05 mmol liter after TMA addition while MMA increased. After TMA was consumed MMEA increased again, indicating that choline was not consumed in the presence of TMA.  We have demonstrated the use of choline and DMEA as direct substrates for methanogens in new isolates belonging to the genus Methanococcoides. Previously, methanogenesis from choline was only described in cocultures of either methanogens and sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio spp. (9) or mixed cultures of fermenters, sulfate reducers, and methanogens for complete mineralization (13) . In both cases, the syntrophic partners metabolized choline to trimethylamine, which could be used as a substrate by the methanogen. Desulfovibrio spp. oxidized the carbon backbone of the choline to acetate and used the gained electrons for sulfate reduction. No PCR product was obtained from the methanogen cultures using Bacteria-specific primers, which excludes the presence of any bacterial syntrophic contaminants in the cultures. In addition, the end products of the methanogenic degradation of choline were methane, carbon dioxide, and ethanolamine, and potential fermentation products (e.g., methylamines and acetate) were not detected. This demonstrates that choline was directly demethylated. The measured consumption and production of products also fits the expected stoichiometries (Table 3) . Finally, the specific methanogen inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) inhibited growth and methane production from choline. At present we can only speculate how widespread the capacity to use choline and N,N-dimethylethanolamine as the substrates is among methanogens in general, but as five of our recent Methanococcoides isolates (n ϭ 15) utilized choline and 10 used DMEA, which was also used by two of three Methanococcoides type strains, these metabolic capabilities may be quite widespread among Methanococcoides spp. Both compounds have been unsuccessfully tested as the substrates for a limited number of methanogens before (e.g., Methanosarcina and Methanococcoides spp.) (9, 29) . However, as in our experiments, lag phases in some of the tests were very long (up to 60 days for M. burtonii on DMEA) and in some cases growth was very slow (strain DM1) or not detected (strains NM1, PM1 and PM2), thus it may be that previous tests were terminated too early to show activity. In the present study, all cultures were incubated for at least 1 year to make sure that no activity was missed. However, in future studies both compounds should be tested as potential substrates. Strain AM1 grows well with choline and DMEA but not with MMEA if it is the sole substrate. This is surprising, as the MMEA transiently formed during growth on choline was consumed (Fig.  2) . This might be explained by the relatively low energy yield per mol of MMEA compared to that of DMEA and choline (Table 3) . However, if the energy yield is normalized per methyl group, the value for MMEA is similar to that for TMA (Ϫ23.8 and Ϫ23.1 kJ per mol for MMEA and TMA, respectively). Another possibility is that the cells do not possess a sensor or an uptake system for MMEA, and this compound is unspecifically transported by a choline or DMEA transporter. This would explain the low rate of methane formation and why the presence of MMEA did not induce the production of the required enzymes for methane formation from MMEA. Similarly, MMEA could be demethylated by previously produced methyltransferases for choline and/or DMEA, with MMEA either not having or not being able to induce a specific methyltransferase. Such unspecific uptake and demethylation may be the cause of the slow consumption of choline by strains NM1, PM1, and PM2. Choline as a substrate for methanogens in the environment? These results clearly show that choline can be a direct substrate for some methanogens, and as choline is widely distributed in membrane lipids and is a component of sediment biota, it could be a significant new methanogenic substrate in the environment, along with its metabolite DMEA. However, whether Methanococcoides spp. can compete for choline in the environment needs to be tested. While strain AM1 grows relatively fast, strain DM1, for example, needed more than 200 days to degrade 5 mM choline but grows much faster with TMA. Strain DM1 would hardly be able to compete for choline with fast-growing fermenters (10) and sulfate reducers such as Desulfovibrio spp. (24) but would easily grow in a syntrophic relationship with TMA as the substrate. Experiments with intertidal sediments suggest choline is degraded syntrophically (13), as amendment with BES to inhibit methanogenesis resulted in about 80% of added choline appearing as TMA. However, when sulfate reduction was inhibited by the addition of molybdate, the maximum TMA concentration observed was less than 40% of that of the added choline. This indicates that TMA was rapidly used up by methanogens while accumulating, but it might also be due to some of the choline being degraded by methanogens directly. Any direct methanogenic choline utilization would have resulted in accumulation of ethanolamine, but this compound was not analyzed (13) . Ethanolamine can be fermented by some Clostridium spp. (4) and used by some sulfatereducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfofrigus; H. Sass, unpublished data). Therefore, choline could be demethylated to form ethanolamine by methanogens with subsequent utilization by fermenters or sulfate reducers. Further studies of methylated ethanolamines are needed to determine the following: whether they can be used by methanogens other than Methanococcoides, the ability of methanogens to compete for these compounds with other anaerobic prokaryotes, and their degradation pathways in a range of anaerobic habitats. ) were estimated using the group contribution method described by Jankowski et al.

2449122,"How Clonal Is Clonal? Genome Plasticity across Multicellular Segments of a “Candidatus Marithrix sp.” Filament from Sulfidic, Briny Seafloor Sediments in the Gulf of Mexico","""Candidatus Marithrix"" is a recently described lineage within the group of large sulfur bacteria (Beggiatoaceae, Gammaproteobacteria). This group of bacteria comprises vacuolated, attached-living filaments that inhabit the sediment surface around vent and seep sites in the marine environment. A single filament is ca. 100 µm in diameter, several millimeters long, and consists of hundreds of clonal cells, which are considered highly polyploid. Based on these characteristics, ""Candidatus Marithrix"" was used as a model organism for the assessment of genomic plasticity along segments of a single filament using next generation sequencing to possibly identify hotspots of microevolution. Using six consecutive segments of a single filament sampled from a mud volcano in the Gulf of Mexico, we recovered ca. 90% of the ""Candidatus Marithrix"" genome in each segment. There was a high level of genome conservation along the filament with average nucleotide identities between 99.98-100%. Different approaches to assemble all reads into a complete consensus genome could not fill the gaps. Each of the six segment datasets encoded merely a few hundred unique nucleotides and 5 or less unique genes - the residual content was redundant in all datasets. Besides the overall high genomic identity, we identified a similar number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the clonal segments, which are comparable to numbers reported for other clonal organisms. An increase of SNPs with greater distance of filament segments was not observed. The polyploidy of the cells was apparent when analyzing the heterogeneity of reads within a segment. Here, a strong increase in single nucleotide variants, or 'intrasegmental sequence heterogeneity' (ISH) events, was observed. These sites may represent hotspots for genome plasticity, and possibly microevolution, since two thirds of these variants were not co-localized across the genome copies of the multicellular filament.",N/A,Verena Salman-Carvalho,2016,27536274,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01173
20382895,Characterization of a photosynthetic Euglena strain isolated from an acidic hot mud pool of a volcanic area of Costa Rica,"Conspicuous green patches on the surface of an acidic hot mud pool located near the Rincon de la Vieja volcano (northwestern Costa Rica) consisted of apparently unialgal populations of a chloroplast-bearing euglenoid. Morphological and physiological studies showed that it is a non-flagellated photosynthetic Euglena strain able to grow in defined mineral media at temperatures up to 40°C and exhibiting higher thermotolerance than Euglena gracilis SAG 5/15 in photosynthetic activity analyses. Molecular phylogeny studies using 18S rDNA and GapC genes indicated that this strain is closely related to Euglena mutabilis, another acid-tolerant photosynthetic euglenoid, forming a clade deeply rooted in the Euglenales lineage. To our knowledge this is the most thermotolerant euglenoid described so far and the first Euglenozoan strain reported to inhabit acidic hot aquatic habitats.",N/A,Ana Sittenfeld,2002,19709274,10.1111/j.1574-6941.2002.tb01004.x
12594595,"Pyrobaculum igneiluti sp. nov., a novel anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon that reduces thiosulfate and ferric iron","A novel anaerobic, hyperthermophilic archaeon was isolated from a mud volcano in the Salton Sea geothermal system in southern California, USA. The isolate, named strain 521T, grew optimally at 90 °C, at pH 5.5–7.3 and with 0–2.0 % (w/v) NaCl, with a generation time of 10 h under optimal conditions. Cells were rod-shaped and non-motile, ranging from 2 to 7 µm in length. Strain 521T grew only in the presence of thiosulfate and/or Fe(III) (ferrihydrite) as terminal electron acceptors under strictly anaerobic conditions, and preferred protein-rich compounds as energy sources, although the isolate was capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis places this isolate within the crenarchaeal genus ::: Pyrobaculum ::: . To our knowledge, this is the first ::: Pyrobaculum ::: strain to be isolated from an anaerobic mud volcano and to reduce only either thiosulfate or ferric iron. An in silico genome-to-genome distance calculator reported <25 % DNA–DNA hybridization between strain 521T and eight other ::: Pyrobaculum ::: species. Due to its genotypic and phenotypic differences, we conclude that strain 521T represents a novel species, for which the name Pyrobaculum igneiluti sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 521T (=DSM 103086T=ATCC TSD-56T).","Anaerobic respiratory processes based on the reduction of sulfur compounds or Fe(III) have been proposed to be among the first energy-conserving pathways to develop in the anoxic, high-temperature environment of the early Earth, with important consequences for the geochemistry of the current biosphere [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Today, similar environments are found in anaerobic sediments and subsurface environments such as deep petroleum reservoirs and submarine hydrothermal vents [6, 7] . The anaerobic hyperthermophiles inhabiting such geothermally heated locales on the sea floor, in oil wells/reservoirs and in other subsurface environments are frequently found to utilize thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and Fe(III) as terminal electron acceptors [3, [7] [8] [9] . The Salton Sea geothermal system supports a variety of subsurface hydrothermal features. Located in a rift valley of the San Andreas fault system in southern California, USA, the Salton Sea geothermal system contains the endorheic Salton Sea, hypersaline springs and mud volcanoes. Two main mud volcano systems are expressed at the surface near the southern end of the sea. One field is composed of 1-4 m tall volcanoes that eject a hydrocarbon-rich, anaerobic clay-based liquid at 60-70 C with significant CO 2 bubbling from a reservoir 120 m below the surface. A second nearby field, recently revealed by the receding of the Salton Sea, ejects fluid of a similar composition at 90-95 C. Water, mud, gas and petroleum-bearing seeps pervade the geothermal site and have significant variations in temperature, pH, density and solute content [10] . The seeps are driven by CO 2 released from decarbonation reactions occurring at C at a depth between 0.5 and 1.5 km [10] . The petroleum's composition indicated a hydrothermal origin and evidence of biodegradation [10] . Although the geological and thermodynamic characteristics of the Salton Sea geothermal system have been extensively studied, to our knowledge there have been no prior studies analysing the microbial communities living in and below these hot mud volcanoes. Here, we report the discovery of an isolate named strain 521 T found in the hotter of the two fields. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis places this isolate in the genus Pyrobaculum. The genus Pyrobaculum is within the family Thermoproteaceae, order Thermoproteales, class Thermoprotei and phylum Crenarchaeota that currently comprises nine established species, with Pyrobaculum ferrireducens being the most recently discovered [11, 12] Pyrobaculum neutrophilum (previously classified as Thermoproteus neutrophilus) being the only strain that is obligately autotrophic [13, 14] . While most are obligately anaerobic, others are capable of growing under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions [15] [16] [17] . Most members were isolated from terrestrial hot springs and solfataric waters, the exception being Pyrobaculum aerophilum, which was isolated from a boiling marine water hole [17] . In the absence of oxygen, Pyrobaculum members utilize several alternative electron acceptors, including Fe(III), nitrate, sulfur, thiosulfate, sulfite, selenite, selenate and arsenate [11, 12] . No Pyrobaculum species has been observed to grow by fermentation [12] . Notably, although prokaryotic genomes do not generally contain introns [18] , species in the order Thermoproteales, including the genus Pyrobaculum, commonly contain regions of introns within rRNA genes that may bias environmental sampling methods that use universal 16S rRNA primers [19, 20] . Sampling was performed at a 95 C mud volcano at the Salton Sea geothermal system (33.2188 N 115.6007 W). Samples were collected by injecting about 20 ml of hot, anaerobic mud from the outflow of the volcano into a sealed, anaerobic 120 ml serum bottle containing 60 ml of anaerobic minimal medium (see below), reduced by 0.1 ml of 3 % sodium sulfide. Clearing of the included resazurin dye indicated anaerobiosis. Enrichment cultures were started by direct injection of portions of this sample into the medium described below, using thiosulfate (10 mM) as an electron acceptor. A minimal medium ('AB medium') was used in the initial isolation procedure and in subsequent growth experiments. AB medium contained the following (all concentrations final): PIPES (9 mM), K 2 HPO 4 (2 mM), NH 4 Cl (18 mM), NaCl (0.36 % w/v) and trace elements solution [21] , adjusted to pH 7.0 at 25 C using 10 M NaOH. Resazurin (0.0001 %, w/v) was added as a redox indicator. The medium was transferred to 30 ml Balch tubes, sealed with rubber stoppers, crimped, and made anaerobic and pressurized by bubbling with 100 % N 2 gas, and then autoclaved [22] . After autoclaving, sterile tryptone/yeast/beef (TYB) extract (0.05 %, w/v, for each ingredient) and sodium thiosulfate (10 mM) were added by syringe as the carbon source and the final electron acceptor, respectively. Na 2 SÁ9H 2 O (0.03 %, w/v) was added immediately before inoculation to remove any remaining oxygen, with clearing of the resazurin indicating complete anaerobiosis. The anaerobic medium was inoculated with a stock culture (5 %, v/v) and grown at 90 C in a New Brunswick Innova 3000 water bath shaker at 160 r.p.m. for 5-7 days. Growth was evaluated by direct cell counting under a phase contrast light microscope (Zeiss) at 1000Â magnification using oil immersion. Cells were individually counted using a Petroff Hauser Counting Chamber. To determine the conditions that supported growth, cultures were grown using the procedure described above, across a range of pH values, NaCl concentrations and temperatures. To test for growth dependence on pH, cultures were incubated at the following pH values for 7 days with the indicated buffers (9 mM) substituted for PIPES (pH measured at 25 C): 5.0, 5.5, 6.3 6.8 (MES), 7.7, 8.5 (PIPES) and 9.0 (EPPS). When corrected for the expected DpK a at 90 C, the corresponding pH values were 4.0, 4.5, 5.5, 6.1, 7, 7.3 and 8, respectively. To determine the range of salt concentrations that supported growth, cultures were grown in 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 % (w/v) NaCl for 7 days. To determine the temperature range for growth, cultures were incubated at 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 and 95 C for 5 days. Doubling times were calculated by fitting a linear trendline for the logarithmic transformations of each growth curve for each condition and compared. Each condition was repeated in at least duplicate and the average was calculated for each value. To identify the electron donors that strain 521 T was capable of oxidizing, the following reductants were added at 3.0 mM and the cultures were incubated for 5 days, unless otherwise specified: cellobiose, trehalose, maltose, glucose, mannitol, pyruvate, lactose, lactate, acetate, sorbitol, sucrose, galactose, starch (0.05 %, w/v), gelatin (0.05 %, w/v), beef extract, yeast extract, peptone, casamino acids, tryptone/yeast extract/ casamino acids (TYC, 0.07 %, w/v, each), or TYB (0.05 %, w/v, each). To test for fermentative ability, the isolate was incubated anaerobically with 0.05 % TYB without the addition of an external electron acceptor. Electron acceptor utilization was determined using the following oxidants at 10 mM: sodium thiosulfate, nitrate, sulfate, sulfite, L-cystine and oxidized glutathione. Elemental sulfur and Fe(III) (ferrihydrite) were tested as electron acceptors at 10 g l À1 . Fe (III) (ferrihydrite) was prepared as described by Lovley [23] . To determine if strain 521 T was capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth via H 2 , cultures were bubbled with 50:50 % CO 2 /H 2 instead of the N 2 gas prior to autoclaving in the standard AB medium described above with 10 mM thiosulfate and with and without TYB (0.001 %, w/v). The culture was incubated at 90 C under vigorous shaking for 7 days. Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 litre of harvested cells grown in standard media (as described above) using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. The genome sequence was determined at Molecular Research, LP. Fifty nanograms of DNA was used to prepare the genomic library using the Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). The library insert size was determined by Experion Automated Electrophoresis Station (Bio-Rad) and ranged from 300 to 850 bp (average 500 bp). The pooled library (12 pM) was loaded into a 600 Cycles v3 Reagent cartridge (Illumina) and the sequencing was performed on a Miseq system (Illumina). The isolate's 16S rRNA gene was initially isolated via PCR amplification of genomic DNA using primers Arch-8-F (5¢-TCCGGTTGATCCTGCC-3¢) and Arch-1492-R (5¢-GGC TACCTTGTTACGACTT-3¢). From the annotated genome, the isolate's complete 16S rRNA gene sequence was compared with those of several other archeal strains. All 16S rRNA gene sequences were complete with the exception of Pyrobaculum organotrophum. Introns were removed from sequences prior to alignment using CLUSTAL W [24] . Evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum-likelihood method in MEGA version 6 [25, 26] . Evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method [27] . To determine whether the isolate represented a novel species in the genus Pyrobaculum, its genome was compared with the complete genomes of eight other established Pyrobaculum species: P. calidifontis JCM 11548 T (CP000561.1), P. islandicum DSM 4184 T (CP000504.1), P. aerophilum IM2 T (AE009441.1), P. oguniense TE7 T (CP003316.1), P. arsenaticum DSM 13514 T (NR102989.2), P. neutrophilum V24Sta T (NR102765.2) P. ferrireducens 1860 T (CP003098) and 'P. yellowstonensis' WP30 (CP012158.1). As indicated by quotation marks, 'Pyrobaculum yellowstonensis' is an effectively published species but not validly published [28] . P. neutrophilum was previously classified as Thermoproteus neutrophilum [13] and P. organotrophum JCM 9190 T was not compared because its complete genome was unavailable. Genomes were compared in silico by an online genome-togenome distance calculator (http://ggdc.dsmz.ge) using GGDC 2.0 BLAST Plus [29] [30] [31] . For each comparison, the calculator returned three DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values, based on different criteria, expressed in confidence intervals. The DDH values calculated by the recommended Formula 2 were compared. T were isolated by multiple rounds of dilution to extinction. Isolation was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing, which resulted in a clean sequence indicating the presence of only one archaeal species, and by phase contrast microscopy, which confirmed that only rod-shaped cells were present in cultures of the isolate. Cells were exclusively rod-shaped and non-motile ranging from 2 to 7 µm in length. Doubling times were slightly responsive to changes in pH, with the doubling time being lowest between pH 5.5 and 7.3 and higher when the medium was more acidic or basic (Fig. S1a , available in the online Supplementary Material). pH 5.5 at 90 C yielded the optimal doubling time of 14.3 h. No growth was observed at pH 3 and below or pH 9 and above. Doubling times were also mildly responsive to variations in NaCl concentrations, with 0-2.0 % (w/v) NaCl conferring the lowest doubling times, while 4.0 and 6.0 % (w/v) conferred higher values (Fig. S1b) . NaCl at 0.5 % (w/v) conferred the optimal doubling time of 10.5 h. No growth was observed at NaCl concentrations of 7.0 % (w/v) and greater. Growth was most sensitive to temperature, as doubling times trended downward as temperature increased, with incubation at 90 C conferring the lowest doubling time (Fig. S1c) [20] . †Data from Feinberg et al. [38] . ‡Data from Huber et al. [36] . acceptors tested, strain 521 T was only able to grow in the presence of thiosulfate and Fe(III) (ferrihydrite). The presence of sulfide as the final product of thiosulfate reduction was detected by the methylene blue assay and through the use of a solid state Hg/Au microelectrode system [32, 33] Growth in ferrihydrite initially resulted in a cloudy black solution that cleared after the first day of growth. Soluble Fe 2+ as the final product was detected by the ferrozine assay [34] . The isolate was unable to grow in the presence of elemental sulfur, sulfite, nitrate, sulfate, L-cystine or oxidized glutathione. No fermentation was observed. Growth was observed under autotrophic conditions and was enhanced by the addition of a trace amount of TYB (0.001 %, w/v). The isolate's 16S rRNA gene sequence did not contain any introns. Fig. 1 shows the phylogenetic relationship between strain 521 T and the other members of the class Thermoprotei. Based on the phylogenetic tree reconstructed, strain 521 T was most closely related to the type strains of P. arsenaticum (98.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), P. oguniense (98.7 %) and 'P. yellowstonensis' (98.0 %). T was a rod-shaped, obligately anaerobic, heterotrophic archaeon growing optimally at 90 C. It was incapapable of fermentative growth and required the addition of thiosulfate or Fe(III) (ferrihydrite) as an electron acceptor to support growth. 16S rRNA gene sequencing placed this strain within the genus Pyrobaculum and genome-genome distance calculations estimated DDH between the strain and other established Pyrobaculum members to be no more than 20 %, far below 70 %, the accepted threshold for prokaryotic species differentiation [35] . Therefore, strain 521 T is classified as representing a novel species, for which the name Pyrobaculum igneiluti sp. nov. is proposed, and the tenth established member of the genus Pyrobaculum. Like most established Pyrobaculum species, strain 521 T is rod-shaped, hyperthermophilic and neutrophilic, although it is able to grow between pH 4 and 8, a significant range (Table 1) . Similar to other heterotrophic Pyrobaculum species, the preferred carbon sources were protein-rich nutrients (e.g. TYB, peptone, gelatin, casamino acids). Strain 521 T was also capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth with H 2 and CO 2 , albeit less robust than under heterotrophic conditions. Among the Pyrobaculum species most closely related to P. igneiluti based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, there are several physiological differences. While P. igneiluti, P. arsenaticum and 'P. yellowstonensis' are all strictly anaerobic, P. oguniense is a facultative aerobe capable of living under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions [16, 36, 37] . Of the four, P. igneiluti and P. arsenaticum are facultative autotrophs, and 'P. yellowstonensis' grows optimally at a relatively lower pH than the other three, reflecting the acidic conditions of the geothermal spring from which it was isolated [36, 37] . For the electron acceptors tested here, no two species had an identical combination of electron acceptors utilized. Thus, despite having close phylogenetic relationships, these Pyrobaculum species nonetheless display widely varying phenotypes. To our knowledge, strain 521 T is the first Pyrobaculum strain to be isolated from a mud volcano and to reduce only either thiosulfate or ferric iron. Continued studies will further determine the mechanism by which thiosulfate and ferric iron reduction occurs in P. igneiluti and provide greater insight into the microbial diversity found in the Salton Sea geothermal system. Pyrobaculum igneiluti (ig.ne.i.lu¢ti. L. adj. igneus fiery; L. neut. n. lutum mud; N.L. gen. n. igneiluti of fiery mud). Cells are non-motile straight rods 2-7 µm in length. Growth occurs at pH 4-8 at 90 C (optimum, pH 5.5-7.3), at 75-95 C (optimum, 90 C) and with 0-6 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0-2 %). Strictly anaerobic and uses TYB, casamino acids, peptone and gelatin as energy sources. Autotrophic growth in H 2 /CO 2 is also observed. Unable to oxidize cellobiose, galactose, sucrose, acetate, trehalose, sorbitol, maltose hydrate, glucose, mannitol, sucrose, pyruvate, lactose or lactate. For terminal electron acceptors, only able to reduce thiosulfate and Fe(III) (ferrihydrite). Unable to reduce sulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur, nitrate, L-cystine or oxidized glutathione. The type strain, 521 T (=DSM 103086 T =ATCC TSD-56 T ), was isolated from a mud volcano in the Salton Sea geothermal system in southern California, USA.  The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.",Jerry Lee,2017,28151382,10.1099/ijsem.0.001850

423291,Plant growth promoting capability and genetic diversity of bacteria isolated from mud volcano and lime cave of Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"Twenty four bacterial strains from four different regions of mud volcano and lime cave were isolated to estimate their diversity, plant growth promoting and biocontrol activities to use them as inoculant strains in the fields. An excellent antagonistic effect against four plant pathogens and plant growth promoting properties such as IAA production, HCN production, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, starch hydrolysis and hydrolytic enzymes syntheses were identified in OM5 (Pantoea agglomerans) and EM9 (Exiguobacterium sp.) of 24 studied isolates. Seeds (Chili and tomato) inoculation with plant growth promoting strains resulted in increased percentage of seedling emergence, root length and plant weight. Results indicated that co-inoculation gave a more pronounced effects on seedling emergence, secondary root numbers, primary root length and stem length, while inoculation by alone isolate showed a lower effect. Our results suggest that the mixed inocula of OM5 and EM9 strains as biofertilizers could significantly increase the production of food crops in Andaman archipelago by means of sustainable and organic agricultural system.","Sustainable agriculture has evolved from three perspectives: system of production to achieve self-sufficiency in food, concept of stewardship and means of sustaining rural communities. The indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides not only causes pollution but also leads to uncalled losses of microbial diversity in the natural environment. In view of this, usage of bio based fertilizers and pesticides are one of the promising ways to enhance crop productivity and to manage the plant diseases. In this view, use of plant growth promoting bacteria has an important role in developing promising method for crop management (Sturz et al., 2000) . The PGPR mechanisms to promote plant growth are of diverse nature such as phosphorus solubilization, production of plant hormones (Bent et al., 2001; Reyes et al., 2002) and excretion of diverse compounds like antibiotics or proteolytic enzymes. Some plant-beneficial microorganisms are known to antagonize plant pathogens through competition for nutrients; parasitism by means of hydrolytic enzyme production; inhibition of the pathogens by anti-microbial compounds; induction of systemic resistance in host plants (Whipps, 2001; Compant et al., 2005) . Mud volcanoes are featured where mixed fluid-rich fine-grained sediments, associated with fragments of rocks or consolidated mud, are expelled at the earth's surface or on the seafloor (Staffini et al., 1993) . It was discovered that the immediate surroundings of these volcanoes are constituted of micro-organisms, of which 99% are still unidentified today. One of 1,100 mud volcanoes is located in the Island of Baratang, part of the Great Andaman archipelago, where there was a significant eruption event in 2003. In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, out of total geographical area of 8,249 sq. km land, only 9% land is used for vegetable cultivation. The wilt caused by bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacereaum, fungal pathogen Fusarium sp., damping off caused by Pythium sp., root rot by Rhizoctonia sp. and Macrophomina sp., collar rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii and anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum sp., were reported to cause severe damage to the vegetable crops in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. As a new inch in the search of agriculturally important microorganisms from various sources, here the microorganisms have isolated from Mud Volcano, one of the natural gift of the great Andaman archipelago. Though studies proving that the microorganisms isolated from the terrestrial mud volcano shows potentiality like hydrocarbon utilization and production of methane gas (Alain, 2006 ) the current study was carried out to find out their potential microbial source as plant growth promoters and effective biocontrol agent. Sampling regime and physic-chemical analysis Volcano samples were collected from the Island of Baratang, part of the great Andaman archipelago, Indian Ocean. The samples has been collected from the different points of mud volcano (12º07'46.5"" latitude; 092º47'31.2"" longitude) viz., point of the eruption (PM), end of the volcano (EM), dried part of the mud volcano (DM), outside of the mud volcano (OM) and the soil sample from Lime Cave (LC) (12º05'37.6"" latitude; 092º44'38.5"") were collected to obtain a representative composite sample. In subsamples pH, electrical conductivity, available nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous contents as described by Jacob Parnell (1996) and the results were shown in Table 1 . For isolation of bacteria, 1 g of each soil sample was suspended into 9 mL of sterile saline solution. Ten-fold of serial dilution was performed then 0.1 mL of aliquot was used for pour plating on nutrient agar plates (Anon, 1957) . The plates were maintained at 28 ± 2°C for 48 to 72 h, total colonies were enumerated and the colonies showing visible morphological differences were isolated. Counts were done after 24 h of incubation at 25°C and results were expressed as colony forming units (cfu) g -1 soil (on a dry-weight basis). A total of 52 bacterial isolates were isolated from five soil samples of mud volcano and lime cave soils were purified and maintained on 20% glycerol stock and nutrient agar slant for the further experiments and analysis. Each isolate was subjected to morphology, motility and 3% KOH solubilization test (Suslow et al., 1982) . Biochemical tests were also performed. Nitrate reduction ability of the organisms was determined as described by García de Salamone et al. (1996) . Oxidase activity was measured using the reactive discs from Himedia, India. Based on morphological and biochemical characterization 24 of 52 isolates were selected for PGPR and diversity analysis. Indole acetic acid production Inocula were transferred to tryptone broth was used to quantify auxin production. Sterilized tryptone broth was inoculated with the test culture and incubated at 30°C for 48 and 72 h with occasional shaking. The tubes were centrifuged at 15,500 g for 2 min and auxin production was measured as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) equivalents, as follows: Equal volume of culture supernatant was added with Salkowski reagent (12 g L -1 FeCl 3 + 7.9 MH 2 SO 4 ). The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min for color development. Color intensity was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm using a standard curve (Sarwar and Kremer, 1992) . Phosphate solubilization ability of isolates was assessed qualitatively using Pikovaskaya's agar medium (Pikovaskaya, 1948 ) containing tricalcium phosphate (5 g/L). Each bacterial culture was spot inoculated in the centre of a plate and incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 48 h. Clear/halo zone indicates the positive cultures. The halo zone was calculated by subtracting bacterial colony diameter from the total halo zone diameter (Freitas et al., 1997) . Each test was replicated three times Qualitative assay was done based on strains competition for iron on medium supplemented with ferric complex of chrome azurol S (CAS) as described by Schwyn and Neilands (1987) . The nutrient agar medium was supplemented with CAS 60.5 g in 50 mL, Iron III solution (1 mM Fecl 3 .H 2 0 and 10 mM Hcl in 10 mL) and HDTMA (72.9 mg in 40 mL). The isolates were spot inoculated on the plates and incubated for 48 h at 30°C. Development of yellow-orange halo zone around the culture was considered as positive for siderophore production. Screening for cyanide production HCN production by the isolates was examined as described by Bakker and Schipper (1957) . The isolates were 1272 Venkadesaperumal et al. streaked on plates containing King's B medium amended with glycine (4.4 g/L) and the lid of each Petri plate placed Whatman no.1 filter paper soaked in 0.5% picric acid in 2% sodium carbonate. The plates were then sealed with parafilm and incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 4 days. Change of color from yellow to orange and then to dark brown in the filter paper indicated as positive reaction and the absence as negative reaction. The phytopathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani (ITCC 6376), Pythium aphanidermatum (ITCC 5488) and Macrophomina sp. (ITCC 5519) were collected from the Indian Type Culture Collections Centre, IARI, New Delhi and Sclerotium (Athelia) rolfsii (MTCC 288) collected from Microbial Type Culture Collection, IMTECH, Chandigarh. The antagonistic ability of bacterial isolates was determined by dual culture technique as described by Dennis and Webster (1971) . Six millimeter agar discs containing grown mycelia of any of the four phytopathogenic fungi were at approximate distance apart on a PDA dish. Four bacterial isolates were streaked between the agar discs. Inhibition of fungal mycelium around the bacterial colony was scored for 2-3 days by measuring the radial growth of the pathogen. PDA plate inoculated only with pathogen was taken as control. All strains were tested in two replicates on different plates and the tests were carried out twice for each isolate. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by the following formula where, I is percent inhibition of growth, C is mycelial growth in control plate, T is mycelial growth in test plate.  The fresh culture was spot inoculated on the pre poured Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) medium. The plate was incubated for 2-3 days at 28 ± 2°C. Plates were then flooded with Gram's iodine to visualize halo zone around the bacterial colony, which indicates positive result in utilizing of the cellulose substrate. Proteolytic activities of the cultures were screened qualitatively in a medium containing skim milk. Fresh culture was streaked onto the medium and incubated at room temperature for 24-48 h. Clear zone formation around the colony indicates the proteolytic activity of the bacterium as positive and absence as negative. Bacterial isolates were screened for their sensitivity or resistance to antibiotics. IAR has also been used in the genotypic identification of bacterial species. Plate of Muller Hinton Agar was swabbed with fresh culture; fourteen different antibiotic discs were pressed gently on the surface of the plate at sufficient distance and incubated at 28 ± 2°C for 3 days. The presence of inhibition zones around the discs of the different antibiotics were noted (Bauer et al., 1966) . Each test was replicated three times. A plates containing beef extract, peptone plus sodium chloride at different concentration (7-12%) was inoculated with 20 mL aliquot of an overnight test culture. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 24-48 h. Growth on the culture media plates is recorded as positive and absence of growth is recorded as a negative. The selected bacterial strains exhibiting pronounced in vitro PGP qualities were characterized for their diversity analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted based on the method described by Chen and Kuo (1993) . DNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose, ethidium bromide gel. One hundred nanograms of DNA were used as template in PCR procedures. Selected primers pA and pH (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' and 5'-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3' respectively) were used for amplification as described by Edwards et al. (1989) . The mixture was subjected to initial denaturation of 92°C for 2 min and 10 s followed by 35 cycles of 92°C for 1 min, 48°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min and 10 s and a final extension step of 72°C for 6 min and 10 s using GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR products were resolved using a 1.5% agarose gel photographed under UV transillumination. PCR products of 1.5 kb were sent to commercial gene se- (Table 2) Amplicons obtained using the primers pA and pH have been used for the restriction analysis using HpaII, and MspI resstrictases. The restriction mixture contained 10 mL of PCR product, 1.5 U of each of the restrictases and manufacturer's recommended buffer (2.5 mL of 10x) up to 25 mL volume. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h and the reaction was inactivated by heating at 70°C for 10 min. Restriction products were separated in 3% agarose gel in TAE buffer. Medium size 100 bp DNA (GeNeI) ladder were used to estimate the size of the digested fragments. Strains were genotypically characterized by BOX-PCR, as described by Rademaker and De Bruijn (1997) using BOX A1R (5'-CTA CGG CAA GGC GAC GCT GAC G-3') as primer. Reaction was performed in 50 mL reaction mixture containing: 5 mL buffer (10x), 1 mL of BOX A1R, 1.5 mL of each dNTP, 1 mL of Taq DNA polymerase, 36.5 mL of sterile bidistilled water and 4 mL of template DNA. PCR-amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the temperature profile was as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 6 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 53°C for 1 min, and extension at 65°C for 8 min followed by final extension at 65°C for 16 min. Amplified products were separated by horizontal electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Tomato and chili seeds were treated with bacterial suspensions of OM5 and EM9 strains (10 8 cfu/mL) as well as their combination (OM5+EM9 in equal parts) for 30 min and were shade dried at 28°C for 1 h, the control seeds were coated with sterilized tap water. The treated seeds were sown in pots (15-20 cm) sterilized with 0.7% sodium hypochlorite solution, filled with red sand, soil and farmyard manure (2:1:1) which was sterilized at 121°C for 30 min. Observations were recorded on germination percentage in the beginning, after one month of sowing, 10 seedlings from each replication were assessed for their root length, shoot length, wet weight and dry weight. Each treatment consisted of four replicates of 100 seeds each (25 seeds/pot) and the experiment was repeated three times. For the analysis of ARDRA and BOX PCR molecular weight and Rf values of each band was determined by using 'Molecular Analyst software' (Version 1.5). The character state '1' was given for a band, which could be clearly and reproducibility detected in the gel and '0' was assigned if it was not possible to determine. The similarity coefficient and cluster analysis was performed (Janda, 1991) by the unweighted-pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) of NTSYS-pc 2.02e (Applied Biosciences, Inc., New York, USA).  The characterized mud volcano and lime cave isolates (a total of 52 bacterial isolates) showed diverse morphological and cultural characteristics as indicated from variations in colony size and shape. On the basis of their Gram reaction, 10 (19.2%) of the isolates were found to be Gram positive and about 42 (80.8%) were Gram negative bacteria (Data not shown). Upon subjecting to various biochemical tests, it was observed that 34 isolates (65.4%) were able to degrade tryptophan to indole and pyruvic acid while other isolates showed negative reaction to indole test. Nearly 48.1% (25 isolates) of 52 isolates showed positive result for methyl red test, 27 isolates were shown to produce variable results and negative result for methyl red test. Twenty five isolates showed positive result to Voges Prauskauer test and nearly 51.9% isolates (27 isolates) showed variable and negative result to this test. Twenty three isolates utilized citrate and all the other isolates showed negative result for citrate utilization test. Only 30.8% isolates (16 isolates) were able to reduce nitrate to nitrite, while the rest of the isolates are non-reducers of nitrate. Starch hydrolysis results showed that 26 isolates (50%) were able to hydrolysis starch as a source of carbon and remaining isolates did not hydrolyze the starch. (Data not shown) Based on morphological and biochemical variations 24 distinct isolates were screened for their PGPR potential. Of the 24 isolates 15 were able to produce IAA. The outer part of the mud volcano sample had the more number of IAA producers in relation to other sites. Only 15 out of the 24 isolates were able to solubilize phosphate. The mud volcano sample collected from the outer part showed the highest number of phosphate solubilizer strains in relation to the other sites. Only 7 isolates of 24 were able to produce siderophores. The outer part of the mud volcano sample presented the highest number of isolates that produce siderophores. Of the 24 isolates 5 were able to produce HCN. Dried part of the mud volcano sample had the highest number of hydrogen cyanide production than other sites. Out of 24, 10 isolate showed protease and cellulose production (Table 3) . Isolates OM5, DM5, DM6, EM9, LC6 showed positive result for more than four properties tested. There was no significant contribution of the area from where the samples collected, as demonstrated in Table 3 . When susceptibility to antibiotics was investigated, isolates LC5, EM10 and EM3 showed sensitive to all antibiotics tested, none of the isolates showed resistant to all antibiotics. All OM isolates showed resistant to Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Amoxicillin. Whereas, DM isolates were resistant to Amoxycillin and Vancomycin and PM isolates showed resistant to Vancomycin. Isolates OM5 and EM4 tolerated high salt concentration of 12% (Data not shown). Isolates OM5, EM9 and LC6 showed antagonistic effects against mycelial growth of root rot fungus S. rolfsii (Inhibition zone greater that 40%). Isolates LC6 (67.2%) and EM9 (65.38%) are the only two bacterial isolate which inhibited P. aphanidermatum significantly over the control. Mycelial growth of R. solani was inhibited by strains DM5 (65%), EM9 (60%) and LC6 (57.2%). The antagonistic effect appeared after 3 days of incubation. Among 24 isolates EM9, OM8, OM5, OM11 and DM5 showed statistically significant highest mycelial inhibition of charcoal rot causing fungus Macrophomina sp. (Inhibition zone greater that 50%) (Table 4) . Undigested PCR products amplified with pA and pH primers produced a single band of about 1500 bp. ARDRA analysis revealed large variations among the isolates. Restriction pattern obtained after digestion of the amplified fragment with HpaII and MspI revealed 12 and 15 patterns respectively (Fig. 1a, b, c & d) . Similarity analysis was then performed based on composite ARDRA profile, showed low similarity index around 58% (Figure 2) . Amplified patterns were observed in the band profiles obtained during genetic analysis. Consequently, we suppose that the PGPR and antagonistic effects would not be associated to a single genotype of wide distribution, but to a pronounced bacterial genetic diversity. Four groups were formed in the composite dendrogram analysis. Group I consists of isolates from dried and end point mud volcano, group II formed with four isolates each from end point and dried mud volcano and two iso- lates from outside mud volcano. Group III comprised of predominantly outside mud volcano isolates followed by 2 isolates from lime cave and one isolate from point mud volcano. Group IV formed with two isolates of lime cave only. There is no grouping of correlation was observed among the isolates based on their respective antagonism and PGP properties. BOX sequences are regulatory sequences which can increase and decrease the specific gene expression (Lupski and Weinstock, 1992) . Amplicons obtained by BOX-PCR were analysed on 3% agarose gel (Figure 3a,b) . Strains were grouped into four clusters with low similarity index (Figure 4 ). All the strains showed wide variations in fingerprinting pattern due to their high degree of genetic variability and distributed into different clusters. Green house experiment analysis showed that there was an average increase of 14.2 and 27.4% in seedling emergence of chili and tomato respectively. Seed bacterization of chili and tomato have increased the secondary root numbers up to 56.8 and 46.5% respectively, significant increase in primary root length of both the plants were also noticed. Stem length of chili and tomato were also increased up to 10.5 and 38.1%. No significant difference 1276 Venkadesaperumal et al. 10, 9, 11, 10, 11, PM9, LC1, [4] [5] [6] . c&d Restriction Digestion pattern using enzyme HpaII. 10, 9, 11, 10, 11, PM9, LC1, [4] [5] [6] . 10, 9, 11, 10, 11, PM9, LC1, [4] [5] [6] . were noticed in fresh weight and dry weight of tomato plant but it was interesting to note that fresh and dry weight of chili plant was increased up to 91.2 and 135% respectively. Among all the different treatments, consortium of OM5 and EM9 showed best results in all parameters except fresh and dry weight of tomato (Table 5 and Figure 5 ). Present study is first to report the plant growth beneficial microorganisms in the active mud volcano and lime cave soil. As reported by several authors (Gilbert et al., 1993) that Gram negative ones are the most abundant rhizobacteria, around 80% of our isolates were Gram negative. Twenty four isolates were screened based on morphological and biochemical features. These isolates were screened for their potential PGPR characteristic. These twenty four isolates do not represent the bacterial diversity of the soil. Plant auxin IAA produced by the bacteria enhances plant cell elongation or cell division thus stimulates better root growth (Glick et al., 1998) . It was interesting to note that about 66% of our isolates are IAA producers. Under field conditions precipitated phosphates should be solubilized to readily available ones for plant growth, which can be done by plant growth promoting bacteria (Verma, 2001) . Siderophore produced by bacteria binds to the free iron in the rhizosphere, thus favors the biocontrol agent than those of the pathogen (Siddiqui, 2005) . Of the 24 isolates 7 were able to produce siderophores. Siderophores produced by the isolates should be studied for their affinity towards different iron complexes. Isolate DM5 showed positive response to all properties tested. Isolate EM9 showed positive response to all the above properties tested except cellulase production, isolate OM5 showed positive response to all the above properties tested except IAA and cellulase production. The above tested properties have been reported among the mechanisms by which the microorganisms promote plat growth (Niranjan et al., 2005) , supporting the further evaluation of our isolates for their potentiality. One of the mechanisms of fungal inhibition is degrading their cell wall by lytic enzymes, hence the isolates were also screened for their protease and cellulase production. Ten isolates of 24 showed positive result for both the enzymes production. Growth and yield of several crop plants has been adversely affected by salinity, interaction of plant growth promoting bacteria helps the survival in adverse conditions. All 24 isolates showed positive result of which OM5 and EM4 showed highest tolerant rate. Wide variety of bacterial species can be used to protect plants against fungal and bacterial diseases (Ren et al., 2006) . Our isolates were tested against phytopathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, Macrophomina sp. and Sclerotium (Athelia) rolfsii to assess whether they can act as effective biocontrol agent. Isolates OM5 and EM9 showed comparatively effective antagonism against all pathogens tested and can be considered for good candidature as biocontrol agent. Observations indicated that bacteria use to compete with pathogens for the nutrients available in the culture media and also some diffusible compound secreted by the bacterial strains should be responsible for fungal inhibiton. Eventhough Pantoea agglomerans is considered as bacterial pathogen for rice, studies proved the ability of these strains to reduce incidence of fire blight in apple, pears and flowers (Elmer et al., 2005) . It was also proved as most promising biocontrol agents for variety of bacterial and fungal diseases in plants (Rezzonico et al., 2009 ). A similarity analysis was then performed based on composite ARDRA profile from the use of the two restriction endonucleases (HpaII and MspI) showed low similarity index around 58%. In the genomic finger prints of potential isolates showed no particular correlation between the origin of the isolates and the ARDRA groups could be established. In BOX-PCR four groups were formed. There was a broad range of variations in their fingerprinting pattern due to their high degree of genetic variability and distributed into different clusters. On observation of these results, current study identified a high degree of genetic variability among different species as well as same species. In last few decades there is increased need to explore varied ecological niches to find out beneficial microorganisms. Increasing awareness about the chemically synthesized fertilizers based agriculture practices, this study identified two isolates selected and genetically characterized (Pantoea agglomerans [OM5], Exiguobacterium sp. [EM9]) showed excellent antagonistic property as well as other plant growth promoting properties. Field trail experiments showed increase in the plant growth of tomato and chili by seed bacterization. Hence these isolates can be of good candidate for potential agricultural use as multipurpose organism, effective biocontrol agent and plant growth promoters.

10785502,A complex picture of associations between two host mussels and symbiotic bacteria in the Northeast Atlantic,"Among chemosymbiotic metazoans found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and organic falls, members of the mussel clade Bathymodiolinae (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) have evolved interactions with a higher diversity of bacterial lineages than other bivalve groups. Here, we characterized the bacteria associated with ""Bathymodiolus"" mauritanicus and Idas-like specimens from three sites in the Northeast Atlantic (two mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz and one seamount of the Gorringe Bank). Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding gene sequences demonstrated that ""B"". mauritanicus has a dual symbiosis dominated by two phylotypes of methane-oxidising bacteria and a less abundant phylotype of a sulphur-oxidising bacterium. The latter was the dominant phylotype in a sympatric population of Idas-like mussels at the Darwin mud volcano. These results are the first report of a bacterial phylotype shared between two deep-sea mussels from divergent clades. This sulphur-oxidising bacterium was absent from Idas-like specimens from the other two sites (Gorringe Bank and Meknès mud volcano), in which bacterial clone libraries were dominated by other Gammaproteobacteria related to symbionts previously identified in Idas modiolaeformis from the Eastern Mediterranean. All Idas-like specimens studied herein are closely related and also related to I. modiolaeformis. However, they probably display different associations with bacteria, with the possible absence of both methane- and sulphur-oxidising symbionts at the Gorringe Bank. These results draw a very complex picture of associations between mussels and bacteria in the Northeast Atlantic, which could be highly variable depending on locale characteristics of the habitats.",,Clara Rodrigues,2012,23132300,10.1007/s00114-012-0985-2
22078593,Microbial life in a liquid asphalt desert.,"Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Tobago is a natural asphalt reservoir nourished by pitch seepage, a form of petroleum that consists of mostly asphaltines, from the surrounding oil-rich region. During upward seepage, pitch mixes with mud and gases under high pressure, and the lighter portion evaporates or is volatilized, which produces a liquid asphalt residue characterized by low water activity, recalcitrant carbon substrates, and noxious chemical compounds. An active microbial community of archaea and bacteria, many of them novel strains (particularly from the new Tar ARC groups), totaling a biomass of up to 10(7) cells per gram, was found to inhabit the liquid hydrocarbon matrix of Pitch Lake. Geochemical and molecular taxonomic approaches revealed diverse, novel, and deeply branching microbial lineages with the potential to mediate anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation processes in different parts of the asphalt column. In addition, we found markers for archaeal methane metabolism and specific gene sequences affiliated with facultative and obligate anaerobic sulfur- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The microbial diversity at Pitch Lake was found to be unique when compared to microbial communities analyzed at other hydrocarbon-rich environments, which included Rancho Le Brea, a natural asphalt environment in California, USA, and an oil well and a mud volcano in Trinidad and Tobago, among other sites. These results open a window into the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of recalcitrant hydrocarbon matrices and establish the site as a terrestrial analogue for modeling the biotic potential of hydrocarbon lakes such as those found on Saturn's largest moon Titan.",N/A,Dirk Schulze-Makuch,2011,21480792,10.1089/ast.2010.0488

210914727,Mud volcanoes and the presence of PAHs,"A mud volcano (MV) is a naturally hydrocarbon-spiked environment, as indicated by the presence of various quantities of PAHs and aromatic isotopic shifts in its sediments. Recurrent expulsion of various hydrocarbons consolidates the growth of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial communities in the areas around MVs. In addition to the widely-known availability of biologically malleable alkanes, MVs can represent hotbeds of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well - an aspect that has not been previously explored. This study measured the availability of highly recalcitrant PAHs and the isotopic signature of MV sediments both by GC-MS and δ13C analyses. Subsequently, this study highlighted both the occurrence and distribution of putative PAH-degrading bacterial OTUs using a metabarcoding technique. The putative hydrocarbonoclastic taxa incidence are the following: Enterobacteriaceae (31.5%), Methylobacteriaceae (19.9%), Bradyrhizobiaceae (16.9%), Oxalobacteraceae (10.2%), Comamonadaceae (7.6%) and Sphingomonadaceae (5.5%). Cumulatively, the results of this study indicate that MVs represent polyaromatic hydrocarbonoclastic hotbeds, as defined by both natural PAH input and high incidence of putative PAH-degrading bacterial OTUs.","Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent a group of highly recalcitrant compounds. These compounds are formed due to either incomplete combustion of organic matter or geothermal catagenetic reactions 1, 2 . PAHs are carcinogenic and 16 of them are considered priority pollutants by the United States Environmental Protection Agency 3, 4 . Anthropogenic PAH pollution of soil is a widely spread concern across highly-industrialised areas. Implementation of effective countermeasures against this environmental issue may minimise the incidence of PAH-induced cancer among local populations 1, 5 . Soil is a natural sink for both petrogenic and pyrogenic PAHs. Their soil degradation depends on their intrinsic molecular weight. High-molecular-weight (HMW) PAHs (≥4 benzene rings) tend to be retained by both organic and clay-derived fine particles. Meanwhile, the sinking of low-molecular-weight (LMW) PAHs (≤3 benzene rings) is unlikely due to their ability to volatilize at room temperature [6] [7] [8] [9] . Hence, green and inexpensive methods that can provide high degradation rates of soil-trapped HMW PAHs are of great interest. Bacterial bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils has been studied because of its cost-effectiveness 10 . Some research groups have elucidated the essential characteristics of bacterial PAH consumption in soil by describing Proteobacterial taxa as PAH-degrading markers 11, 12 . However, these studies have a common feature: investigation of bacterial communities isolated from soil that has been recently contaminated with industrially derived PAHs 13, 14 . No study to date has attempted to link PAH bacterial consumption with naturally hydrocarbon spiked environments, such as mud volcanoes (MVs). The genesis of petrogenic PAHs depends both on subsurface movements of sediments, fluids, and kerogen maturation processes. During kerogen maturation, hydrogen distribution determines the accumulation of significant quantities of hydrogen-rich compounds, such as methane: the cornerstone element of MV genesis. In addition to volatile LMW alkanes, HMW PAHs are formed as by-products of kerogen maturation reactions 15, 16 . Most recent studies have focused on the influence of LMW alkanes on the distribution and metabolic behaviour of MV microbial communities. All of these studies used both culture-dependent (enrichment cultures) and culture-independent techniques (mcrA and 16S rRNA gene profiling, as well as metagenomics) [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, little attention has been paid to the polyaromatic aspects of MV. This study investigated sediments that were sampled from previously undescribed MVs in the Republic of Moldova. The study focused on PAH availability, isotopic signature, and mineralogical profile of the MV sediments (i.e., mud). Additionally, the study highlighted the occurrence and distribution of putative PAH-degrading bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Physicochemical profile. The investigated MV sediments were clays. These clays had the following physicochemical features: pH = 8.70; Eh = −115 mV; salinity = 0.3%; electrical conductivity = 713-1620 mS/cm. X-ray diffraction indicated that sediments are composed mainly of quartz (JCPDF 1-079-1910), calcite (JCPDF 00-002-0629), muscovite (JCPDF 00-002-0467), and feldspar (JCPDF 00-002-0457 and JCPDF 00-018-1202). The sediments sampled from the surface of MV were aerated. The sediments sampled from the 10-80 cm depth were saturated with water and depleted of oxygen. The PAH concentration in the mud varied with depth; higher values were observed on the MV surface (33.44 µg/kg) followed by a 4-to 7-fold decrease at depths ≥10 (cm) (5.55 µg/kg) ( Table 1) . We observed a difference between HMW and LMW PAH concentrations in the investigated mud samples. The HMW PAHs such as benzo[b]fluoranthene (12.26 µg/kg) and benzo[a]pyrene (6.62 µg/kg) showed higher concentrations on the surface of the MV. The concentrations of LMW such as phenanthrene and pyrene reached 2.70 and 2.28 µg/kg, respectively. Mud samples collected from the ≥10 cm depth had negligible LMW PAH concentrations compared to surface MV samples. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) values reached 1.43 mg/kg ( Table 1 ). The analysis of δ 13 C indicated a narrow interval of values attributed to the MV mud samples. The values varied between −25.52 and −26.00‰ (average = −25.71‰, SD = 0.18‰). The δ 13 C analysis underlined the isotopic predominance of the aromatic fraction over the aliphatic fraction ( Fig. 1 ). To provide an accurate OTU profile, we described the features of each mud sample. Notably, due to the low resolution of the metabarcoding procedure, we relied on risk pooling strategy 21 , ""reducing overall risk of erroneous statement by combining incidence of variables of interest"" when reporting any ""putative PAH-degrading bacterial taxa"" statements extrapolated from metabarcoding data 21 . The MV surface sample had the most diverse OTU profile. This sample had the highest richness and phylogenetic diversity among all the collected samples ( Table 2 ). The abundance of non-Proteobacterial units exceeded that of Proteobacteria. Bacterial classes with the highest abundance were Bacilli, Cytophagia, and Nitriliruptoria ( Fig. 2a ). Meanwhile, the orders with the highest OTU incidence were Actinomycetales (5.7%), Myxococcales (5.2%), Rhodobacterales (4.5%), Acidimicrobiales (4.1%), Rhodospiriralles (3.0%), and Xanthomonadales (1.3%). The samples collected from the 10 cm depth were characterised by lower richness, contrary to the surface. However, this depth was defined by high bacterial diversity ( Table 2 ). As shown in Fig. 2a the most abundant orders were Rhizobiales (24.6%), Enterobacteriales (20.4%), Burkholderiales (11.1%), Sphingomonadales (3.2%), and Xanthomonadales (1.8%). The samples collected from the 20 cm depth had the lowest richness and diversity ( Table 2 ). Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria representatives dominated the overall profile. Contrary to the surface and 10 cm samples, the abundance of Deltaproteobacteria OTUs decreased to a minimum of 0.3%. Classes that predominated on the surface and 10 cm depth samples seemed not to have any substantial impact on the local community, except for Proteobacteria units (Fig. 2a ). The 20 cm sample was dominated by such orders as Rhizobiales (38.8%), Enterobacteriales (31.5%), Burkholderiales (19.2%), and Sphingomonadales (3.6%). PAHs concentration (µg/kg) The OTU profile attributed to the 40 cm sample had similar features to the 20 cm sample ( Table 2 ). In this study, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria units had the highest abundances from all the samples investigated in this study: 49.9%. 25.9% and 16.9%, respectively ( Fig. 2a ). The most abundant orders were Rhizobiales (39.1%), Enterobacteriales (22.1%), Burkholderiales (16.9%), Sphingomonadales (8.0%), and Rickettsiales (1.6%). Mud sampled from the depth of 80 cm had similar richness and diversity which was previously observed on the surface (Table 2 ). In this study, we observed that the OTU profile was represented by non-Proteobacteria units (56.2%). The incidence of Proteobacteria marked a twofold decrease relative to the values observed in the 40 cm samples. Nevertheless, this value was higher than the values observed on the surface level ( Fig. 2b) . The metabarcoding of the overall MV bacterial profile highlighted the predominance of Proteobacteria OTUs in all the investigated mud samples except for the surface sample ( Fig. 2b) . OTUs linked to PAH-degrading bacteria followed this trend. The majority of the OTUs had incidence values as high as 77.8-87.4%. The lowest incidence of PAH-degrading representatives could be observed on the surface, where only Hyphomicrobiaceae and Rhodobacteraceae played a significant role in the local community. Generally, the overall OTU library was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae (31.5%), Methylobacteriaceae (19.9%), Bradyrhizobiaceae (16.9%), Oxalobacteraceae (10.2%), Comamonadaceae (7.6%), and Sphingomonadaceae (5.5%) ( Fig. 3 ). GC-MS analysis showed that MV was spiked with PAHs. The dominance of HMW PAHs, such as benzo[b] fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene on the MV surface was terminated by low solubility, constant asphaltene expelling, and limited bacterial ability to oxidise polyaromatic compounds 15, 22 . However, scarce LMW PAHs on the MV surface were caused by rain washing, summer-time volatilisation or extensive bacterial oxidation. The PAH traces that reached the lower hypoxic mud strata were slowly mineralized by bacteria or fungi 23 . Cumulatively, these processes could explain the decreasing gradient of PAHs. To highlight the aliphatic/aromatic isotopic shift in the investigated samples, the MV δ 13 C signature was compared to the other hydrocarbon-spiked sediment signatures [24] [25] [26] [27] . The results of this procedure underlined an overall δ 13 C shift towards aromatic petroleum fractions. This aromatic shift was caused by both underlying catagenesis and the predominance of aromatic compounds in the MV 15, 16 . The aromatic shift was consistent with the recurrent encounter of PAHs and TPHs in the MV samples. Proteobacteria OTUs outclassed non-Proteobacteria OTUs at depths of 10-40 cm. The majority of the encountered Proteobacteria units were linked to the well-known PAH-degrading bacterial taxa. The high incidence of the putative Proteobacteria PAH-degrading taxa could be attributed to the MV hydrocarbon-spiked medium. (Fig. 4) . MV clay-derived sediments with water content were collected in two distinct batches. Mud samples were collected in triplicate using a push-tube sampler (300 g per sample). The mud samples were carefully taken from both MV surface crust and four successive depths (qualified as inner samples) within the MV cone: 10, 20, 40, and 80 cm. After the sampling procedure, mud samples were rapidly transported on ice to the laboratory 38 . The first batch of mud samples, kept at −20 °C, was subjected to microbial diversity analysis which implied metabarcoding of the overall MV bacterial community. The second batch of samples, kept at 4 °C, was chosen for pH, salinity, conductivity, GC-MS and mineralogical analyses. Before all analyses, equal quantities of mud from each set of triplicates were mixed to form a representative sample. Notably, data obtained from both of the investigated batches cannot be correlated because MV is not uniformly stratified. This feature comes from intermittent MV activity and underlying downhill relief. Incidence of mud volcano operational taxonomic units linked to PAH-degrading bacteria within investigated mud samples. Note: Baseline value is equal to the surface taxa incidence; Max -maximum taxa incidence; Min -minimum taxa incidence ≠ 0%.

Physicochemical parameters (pH, salinity, redox potential, electrical conductivity) were measured on site using a portable multi-parameter Multi 3320 WTW. X-ray diffraction analysis of powder samples was carried out on a Bruker D8 Advanced in Bragg-Brentano configuration using a Cu anode X-ray source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. In the beam path was a 0.6 mm slit, Ni 0.0125 mm filter, and on receiving side a 2.5° Soller slit and a LynxEye detector. The X-ray diffraction was recorded from 5° to 64° (2 T) with 0.02° (2θ) step and 0.5 s/step. DifracEva software (Bruker Co.) and the ICDD database are used for mineral identification. formed to describe an accurate bacterial profile of the investigated MV. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from the mud samples using the ZR Soil Microbe DNA MiniPrep TM kit (ZymoResearch, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The replicate DNA samples from each depth were quality checked on a 1% agarose gel (data not shown) and pooled followed by quantification using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) (data not shown). These DNA samples were stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Microbial diversity investigation was performed based on a metabarcoding approach using the V3-V4 regions of the 16 S rRNA gene. DNA fragments were amplified through PCR with the PRK341F/PRK806R universal primer pair 39 The raw sequencing data (SRA: SRP133053) were processed as described by Chiriac et al. 40 . Briefly, singletons with less than 350 nucleotides and those with more than 0.2 total expected errors were discarded using the Usearch v8 pipeline 41 . De novo and reference chimaera checking were carried out with Usearch v8, using the latest version of the Greengenes database ('13_8') as a ref. 42 . Taxonomic affiliation of representative OTUs was established in QIIME 43 , and the plastidial and mitochondrial sequences were filtered out from the final OTUs table. GC-MS assay. GS-MS analysis was performed to evaluate hydrocarbon availability in the investigated samples. A combination of existing methods 38, [44] [45] [46] was used for mud sampling and processing. A total of 3 (g) of dried, ground and sieved (500 µm) mud sample was extracted by sonication (3 × 15 min) with CH 2 Cl 2 : n-C 6 H 6 (1:1 v/v) (3 × 10 ml). The collected extracts were passed through Na 2 SO 4 anhydrous cartridges, previously washed www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with n-C 6 H 6 and CH 2 Cl 2 , then evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 2 ml CH 2 Cl 2 : n-C 6 H 6 (1:1 v/v) for 16 priority PAH analyses and in 1 ml CH 2 Cl 2 : n-C 6 H 6 (1:1 v/v), for total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) analysis 47 . PAH and TPH analyses were performed by GC-MS using a Focus GC gas chromatograph with a DSQ II quadrupole mass spectrometer detector (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). GC separation was achieved on a TR-5MS non-polar capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) containing 5% phenyl polysilphenylene-siloxane. Samples were injected (1 µl) in splitless mode by an autosampler Thermo TriPlus AS. Transfer line and ion source temperatures were 300 °C and 200 °C for PAH analysis and 310 °C and 200 °C for TPH analysis. The oven temperature programme started at 120 °C up to 300 °C for PAH analysis and from 100 °C up to 310 °C for TPH analysis. Helium is used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/ min. Selected ion monitoring mode was used during GC-MS analysis for PAH and full scan mode for TPH analysis 38,44-47 . δ 13 C analysis. Analysis of δ 13 C was performed to identify the MV isotope signature. Mud samples were dried at 40 °C, milled, and homogenised in an agate mortar. To remove any carbonates from the samples 48 , milled material was treated with 10% HCl 49 until no reaction was observed and then left for 24 hours in the acid solution. The resulting material was dried at 40 °C for 48 hours and then milled and homogenised again in an agate mortar. The agate mortar was washed and treated with hydrogen peroxide between each sample and then dried. Isotopic δ 13 values were measured using a Picarro G2121-i type analyser (Picarro Inc., USA) coupled with a combustion module (Costech Analytical Technologies Inc., USA) in the Stable Isotope Laboratory of the Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Sample analysis was performed as previously described 50 . Measured values (two to four measurements on each sample) were calibrated using internal laboratory standards (atropine and acetanilide) and the average was reported. The δ 13 C values are expressed regarding VPDB 51 using the following equation δ 13 C = [(R sample /R standard ) − 1] × 1000 (‰), where R is the 13 C/ 12 C ratio. Precision was within ±0.09‰ (1σ) based on measured samples and the reproducibility of measurements was checked with measurements on standard B2155 (Elemental Microanalysis Ltd, UK), was within ±0.05‰ (1σ). Raw sequencing data generated during the current study are available in the SRA repository (SRP133053).",Alexei Remizovschi,2020,31988316,10.1038/s41598-020-58282-2
818482,"Molecular Characterization of Potential Nitrogen Fixation by Anaerobic Methane-Oxidizing Archaea in the Methane Seep Sediments at the Number 8 Kumano Knoll in the Kumano Basin, Offshore of Japan","The potential for microbial nitrogen fixation in the anoxic methane seep sediments in a mud volcano, the number 8 Kumano Knoll, was characterized by molecular phylogenetic analyses. A total of 111 of the nifH (a gene coding a nitrogen fixation enzyme, Fe protein) clones were obtained from different depths of the core sediments, and the phylogenetic analysis of the clones indicated the genetic diversity of nifH genes. The predominant group detected (methane seep group 2), representing 74% of clonal abundance, was phylogenetically related to the nifH sequences obtained from the Methanosarcina species but was most closely related to the nifH sequences potentially derived from the anoxic methanotrophic archaea (ANME-2 archaea). The recovery of the nif gene clusters including the nifH sequences of the methane seep group 2 and the subsequent reverse transcription-PCR detection of the nifD and nifH genes strongly suggested that the genetic components of the gene clusters would be operative for the in situ assimilation of molecular nitrogen (N2) by the host microorganisms. DNA-based quantitative PCR of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene, the group-specific mcrA (a gene encoding the methyl-coenzyme M reductase α subunit) gene, and the nifD and nifH genes demonstrated the similar distribution patterns of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene, the mcrA groups c-d and e, and the nifD and nifH genes through the core sediments. These results supported the idea that the anoxic methanotrophic archaea ANME-2c could be the microorganisms hosting the nif gene clusters and could play an important role in not only the in situ carbon (methane) cycle but also the nitrogen cycle in subseafloor sediments.","The potential for microbial nitrogen fixation in the anoxic methane seep sediments in a mud volcano, the number 8 Kumano Knoll, was characterized by molecular phylogenetic analyses.

These results supported the idea that the anoxic methanotrophic archaea ANME-2c could be the microorganisms hosting the nif gene clusters and could play an important role in not only the in situ carbon (methane) cycle but also the nitrogen cycle in subseafloor sediments. In the anoxic, methane-abundant marine sediments, there are known to exist microbial ecosystems supported by a high flux of methane derived from the deeper sources of gas and hydrate forms (17, 30) . The microbial anoxic oxidation of methane (AOM) in the marine sediments is considered a key process in the global carbon cycle to prevent the emission of methane into the ocean (15, 40) . The microorganisms responsible for the AOM in marine sediments have been identified to be anaerobic methanotrophs (ANMEs) (14, 34) . To date, marine ANMEs have been classified into three phylogenetic groups (17, 35) . ANME-2 and ANME-3 are likely associated with the formation of syntrophic consortia with sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria (2, 17, 19) while it is suggested that ANME-1 operates the AOM singly (35) . Although all the ANME archaea are still resistant to cultivation under laboratory culture conditions, the phylogenetic diversity, biogeographical distribution, and potential methane oxidation mechanisms of the ANMEs have been extensively studied by various culture-independent techniques (11, 12, 18) . Nevertheless, little is known about what kinds of substances other than methane and sulfate support the ANMEs' activities and functions in in situ habitats (28) . The nitrogen sources for the ANMEs are one of the important questions to be clarified. Recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization-secondary ion mass spectrometer (FISH-SIMS) analysis using 15 N-nitrogen compounds has revealed that the ANME-2 archaea have the potential to take up ammonia and amino acids as their nitrogen sources for protein synthesis under microcosm experiment conditions (36) . However, the in situ nitrogen sources and assimilation mechanisms of the ANMEs are still unclear. In methane seep sediments, the methane is likely supplied from the potential subseafloor gas and/or hydrate pools that could be accumulated by some of the physical and chemical processes associated with the geological settings, regardless of its biogenic and thermogenic origins. In these processes, it is supposed that molecular nitrogen (N 2 ) represents a transportation behavior that is relatively similar to that of methane in terms of how gaseous components in the subseafloor fluid flow compared to the other dissolved inorganic (ammonium and ni-trate) and organic nitrogen compounds. However, as the in situ concentration of the molecular nitrogen in the pore water of subseafloor core sediments is technically difficult to measure due to contamination of air during the sampling process, the biogeochemical relevance of the methane and N 2 fluxes in methane-rich marine sediments has been poorly understood. In addition, even with other dissolved nitrogen sources, there have been very few studies on biogeochemical interactions of anoxic methane and nitrogen metabolisms (6, 36, 38) . Nitrogen fixation is the first step of the global nitrogen cycle and converts N 2 into ammonia (NH 3 ). But the biological N 2 -fixing function is limited to several groups of bacteria and methanogenic archaea (39) . N 2 fixation is catalyzed by a nitrogenase consisting of two components: Fe protein (nitrogenase reductase component) encoded by nifH and MoFe protein (nitrogenase component) encoded by nifDK (42) . These nifHDK genes form a cluster in the known nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes (8, 39) . Although the Fe protein does not directly react with nitrogen, the amino acid sequences of the Fe proteins are highly conserved among the N 2 -fixing prokaryotes. In addition, the phylogenetic classification of nifH is highly consistent with the prokaryotic taxonomy by 16S rRNA gene sequences (13, 31, 47) . Thus, the nifH gene has been adopted as a useful marker for detection of potential nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in various environments such as oligotrophic oceans (23, 49) , marine microbial mats (48) , modern marine stromatolites (7), tropical sea grass beds (1), rice roots (5, 20) , salt marsh sediments (21, 46) , hot springs (10), marine sponges (27) , and hydrothermal fields (24, 25) . In the metagenomic analysis of the anoxic methanotrophic microbial communities in the Eel River basin, novel lineages of the nifH gene that was most closely related to the nifH sequences of the Methanosarcina members were identified (37) . The cellular level of FISH-SIMS analysis of the microbial communities enriched with 15 N 2 -tracer strongly suggested that some of the ANME-2 members could have both AOM and N 2 -fixation functions (37) . However, the distribution and abundance of the potentially N 2 -fixing anoxic methanotrophic archaea in the marine methane-rich environments are poorly understood. Therefore, we did not know whether N 2 fixation by anoxic methanotrophs affects a global N cycle in the sediments or minor N source uptake in the cell. Knowing the distribution, abundance, and diversity of nif genes can further understanding of the global N cycle in the anoxic methane seep sediments. In this study, we conducted a molecular survey of the nifH genes in the methane seep sediments at a mud volcano, the number 8 Kumano knoll in the Kumano Basin, off shore of Japan, where the active AOM activities were expected by the extensive formation of thioautotrophic endosymbionthosting Calyptogena colonies on the seafloor. The phylogenetic characterization of the nifH genes in the 40-cm-deep core sediments revealed the possible existence of the N 2 -fixing methanotrophic archaea through the depths of the sediments. The predominant nifH phylotype was derived from the intact nifHDK gene cluster, and the genetic components of the gene cluster were expressed at considerable levels in the host microorganisms thriving in the in situ sediments. Based on the distribution and abundance of different molecular markers of the archaeal communities (16S rRNA gene, mcrA, and nifHD) in the sediments, it was determined that the ANME-2 members would be the possible N 2 -fixing archaeal components.  A mud volcano, the number 8 Kumano Knoll, is located at 33°37.1ЈN, 136°33.5ЈE and at a water depth of 2,050 m in the Nankai Trough. The relative height from the proximal basin is 40 m, and its diameter is about 800 m. The Calyptogena colony was observed with patchy microbial mats at the rim of the mud volcano. Samplings were carried out with the manned submersible Shinkai 6500 (dive 946) during the YK06-03 cruise (May 2006) of R/V Yokosuka (JAMSTEC, Japan). The sediment cores (946C2 and 946C3) from a white microbial mat site and a reference site about 7-m away from the microbial mat, respectively, were sampled by a 50-cm-long push corer. The core sediments were subsampled by sterilized syringes at 5-cm intervals and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. After the cruise, samples were stored at Ϫ80°C in our laboratory. Characterization of pore water chemistry. Pore water was obtained from sediments within 3 h after recovery. The innermost parts of core sediments were taken immediately into 50-ml plastic syringes, and then the pore water was extracted by pressure filtration through a 0.45-m-pore-size filter by using a stainless steel clamp at 4°C. Some chemical species are very unstable during storage and therefore require shipboard analysis (9) . Silica and ammonia concentrations were determined on board by colorimetric techniques (9) . Alkalinity was determined by titration with hydrochloric acid using a Gran plot estimation of the endpoint (9) . Chloride concentration was determined by the Mohr titration method, with an analytical error of Ͻ0.3% (9). For other major dissolved elemental species, analyses were conducted in shore-based laboratories (29) . Concentrations of sodium, calcium, and magnesium were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (29) , and concentrations of sulfate and nitrate were determined by ion chromatography (9) . Analytical errors in these instrumental analyses are estimated at ϳ5%. Compound-specific concentrations and stable carbon isotopic compositions of total CO 2 (⌺CO 2 ), methane, and ethane were measured by an isotope ratio-monitoring gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (MAT252; Thermo Finnigan, Bremen, Germany) as previously described (45) . DNA extraction and sequencing analysis. DNA extraction and purification were carried out from 1 g (wet weight) of the core sediments at 5-cm intervals using an UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Solana Beach, CA) and a MagExtractor PCR and Gel Clean-up kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The archaeal 16S rRNA gene, mcrA, and nifH-nifD-nifK genes were amplified from the extracted DNA by PCR using LA Taq with GC buffer (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are summarized in Table S1 in the supplemental material. All the PCR conditions used in this study were also summarized in Table S2 in the supplemental material. The amplified DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using an UltraClean GelSpin DNA extraction kit (MO BIO Laboratories). The purified DNA fragments were ligated into the pCR2.1 vector in a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The clone libraries were constructed by transforming Escherichia coli INV␣FЈ (Invitrogen) with the ligation mixture, and the cloned fragments were directly sequenced by method of Sanger et al. (41) . Phylogenetic analysis. The determined sequences were analyzed using the ARB software package (22) . The trees in this study were also constructed by the neighbor-joining method using ARB software package. RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis. RNA extraction from the sediments was performed by using an RNA PowerSoil total RNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories). The extracted RNA (500 ng) was treated with 2 l of 100 U/ml DNase I (Invitrogen) overnight at room temperature. Then, reverse transcription (RT) was carried out by Superscript III (Invitrogen) using random hexamers. The synthesized DNA was subjected to PCR to amplify mcrA, nifH, and methane seep group 2 nifD. The amplification conditions of RT-PCR are summarized in Table S2 in the supplemental material. qPCR analysis. All of the quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses were performed by using a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the DNA samples extracted from the sediments. All of the qPCR programs and primers used are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material. Primers used in these analyses were designed with the ARB software package. Quantification of both the entire prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene population and the archaeal 16S rRNA gene population was performed according to a previously described quantitative fluorescent PCR method (44) . Quantification of the mcrA gene population was performed according to a quantitative fluorescent PCR method described previously (33) . Other quantifications were performed by SYBR premix EX Taq (Takara bio). Quantification of the group a-b mcrA genes was conducted by using a dilution series of 1 to 1 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ng/ml of an mcrA clone (K8MV-C26mcrA_14) obtained from this study as a standard. Similarly, quantification of the group c-d, group e and group f mcrA genes was tested by using a dilution series of 1 to 1 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ng/ml of the mcrA DNA clones (KM-m-1.21, KM-m-1.09, and KM-m-4.04 from Nunoura et al. [32] ; KM-m-1.19 and KM-m-4.10 from Nunoura et al., [32] ; and K8MV-C22mcrA-19 from this study, respectively) as the standards. Quantification of the universal nifH gene was done by using 2 to 2 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ng/ml of nifH DNA clones obtained from this study (K8MV-C28nifH_06 of methane seep group 1, K8MV-C22nifH_01 of methane seep group 2a, K8MV-C24nifH_04 of methane seep group 2b, K8MV-C28nifH_03 and K8MV-C28nifH_28 of methane seep group 3, and K8MV-C22nifH_05 of methane seep group 4). The DNA mixture of these clones was also utilized as the standard DNA. In addition, quantification of the group 2 of nifD genes was examined by using 1 to 1 ϫ 10 Ϫ7 ng/ml of cloned nif gene clusters obtained from this study (K8MV-C2nifHK1_08, K8MV-C2nifHK1_40, and K8MV-C2nifHK1_11). The mixture of these clones was also utilized as the standard DNA to obtain standard curves for the quantification of nifD. The amplification patterns of all qPCRs constructed in this study are shown in Fig. S5 in the supplemental material. The detection limits of these qPCRs were almost 0.1 to 10 g/ml. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. All of the sequences obtained in this study were deposited into the DDBJ (DNA data bank of Japan) database. The sequences of the nifH-nifI 1 -nifI 2 -nifD-nifK clusters were deposited under the accession numbers AB362193 to AB362197. The sequences of the nifH genes, 16S rRNA genes, and mcrA genes obtained in this study were deposited under accession numbers AB362396 to AB362410, AB362542 to AB362552, and AB362198 to AB362208, respectively.  From the foot of a mud volcano, the number 8 Kumano Knoll, two core samples (946C2 and 946C3) were obtained from a white microbial mat site and a reference site, and the lengths of the cores were 40 and 45 cm, respectively. Immediately after the recovery of the cores, the pore water samples were extracted on board and subjected to the subsequent chemical composition and isotopic analyses ( Table 1) . Both of the cores consisted of clay-or silt-like sediments, and no apparent stratigraphic layer or hydrate formation was observed. As expected from the existence of the seafloor microbial mat and Calyptogena colony formations, the CH 4 concentration in the pore waters was much higher in the microbial mat site than in the reference site (Table 1) . However, the vertical profile of CH 4 concentration in the microbial mat sediments was very variable. In the shallower zones of the core (0 to 5 cm below the seafloor [bsf]), the pore water CH 4 concentration was drastically decreased compared to the concentrations in the deeper zones (Table 1) . This was probably due to the diffusion of CH 4 from the sediments to the seawater and the activities of the sulfate-reducing anoxic methanotrophic communities in the core sediments down to 25 cm bsf. Through the depths (0 to 25 cm bsf), both the CH 4 and sulfate concentrations were inversely changed, and the stable carbon isotope composition of CH 4 (␦ 13 C CH4 ) largely shifted to the heavier values with the decreasing depth (Table 1) . On the other hand, the pore water ⌺CO 2 concentration was more enriched in the microbial mat sediments than in the reference sediments, and the ␦ 13 C ⌺CO2 in the microbial mat sediments was unusually 13 C depleted through the depths compared to the ␦ 13 C ⌺CO2 values in the reference sediments (close to the values of the deep-seawater bicarbonate). In addition, the CH 4 /C 2 H 6 (C 1 /C 2 ) ratio was changed at the shallower zones of the microbial mat sediments (Table 1) . It was also notable that the deepest zone of the core sediments had a much lower concentration of CH 4 in the pore water than the overlying sediments ( Table 1 ). The pore water sulfate concentration, the isotopic compositions of CH 4 and ⌺CO 2 , and the C 1 /C 2 ratio in the deepest zone suggested the possibility of AOM linked with sulfate reduction (Table 1) . Based on all the chemical data described above, the following features in the microbial mat site sediments were delineated: (i) the primary CH 4 input occurred at a depth range of 15 to 30 cm bsf, (ii) CH 4 was diffused to shallower and deeper zones of sediments, and (iii) the sulfate-reducing anoxic methanotrophic communities could consume the CH 4 through the core sediments. In both of the core sediments, the N 2 and nitrate concentrations in the pore waters were not measured. However, the pore water nitrate concentrations in the core sediments (at a depth of approximately 40 cm) collected from a similar microbial mat site in the number 8 Kumano Knoll were below the detection limit (Ͻ1 mol/kg) through the depths (data not shown). Thus, the pore water nitrate concentration may also be quite low in the microbial mat sediments in this study. In contrast, the ammonium was detectable in the core sediments at both the microbial mat and reference sites ( Table 1 ). The vertical profiles of the pore water ammonium concentrations from the microbial mat site and the reference site were generally similar. In the deeper zones of the cores, 30 to 40 mol/kg ammonium was present while it was depleted in the surface zones (Table 1) . However, the ammonium was considerably enriched only in the deepest zone of the microbial mat site (Table 1) . Cloning and diversity of nifH genes. The PCR amplification of nifH genes was conducted with the extracted DNA samples from the sediments at the microbial mat site and reference site. Only from the sediments at the microbial mat site (core 946C2) were the nifH genes successfully amplified. Thus, the subsequent analyses were performed using the samples of the microbial mat site core. In total, 111 of the nifH clones were sequenced and subjected to sequence similarity analysis using the deduced amino acid sequences. We tentatively determined that the nifH clone whose amino acid sequence had Ͻ94% similarity to the sequences of all other clones represented an independent phylotype. According to this definition, 16 phylotypes were obtained through the core sediments and were compared with the previously deposited nifH sequences (Table  2 ). In addition, based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16 nifH phylotypes, four representative groups of the nifH phylotypes were identified (Fig. 1) , as described below. (i) Methane seep group 1. Two clones (K8MV-C28nifH_06 is a representative phylotype) of methane seep group 1 were obtained from the sediments at 15 to 20 cm bsf and 35 to 40 cm bsf. These clones had the same amino acid sequences of the amplified fragments and were assigned to cluster II of the nifH gene (39) . The phylotype was closely related to the nifH clone sequences (79% similarity of amino acid sequence) obtained from the Juan de Fuca hydrothermal vent fluids (24) . This group of nifH sequences was likely hosted by potential methanogens within the order Methanococcales (Fig. 1) (26) . (ii) Methane seep group 2. Methane seep group 2 is the most abundantly detected group of nifH clones from the microbial mat sediments (core 946C2) (74% of the total clones from all the depths) ( Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). Based on the tree topology, this group could be further classified into methane seep group 2a and 2b (Fig. 1) . The nifH sequences most closely related to the group of nifH genes obtained in this study were the sequences from Methanosarcina acetivorans strain C2A and Methanosarcina mazei strain Go1 (75 to 79% similarity). The phylogenetic relationship between the number 8 Kumano Knoll nifH phylotypes of the methane seep group 2 and the Methanosarcina nifH sequences indicated that they were considerably related to but also distinct from each other (Fig. 1) . As observed in the methane seep group 2, nifH sequences were likely derived from the host microorganisms potentially classified into the order Methanosarcinales. (iii) Methane seep group 3. From the different depths of sediments, we obtained a total of 17 clones (three representative phylotypes) that could be affiliated within cluster III of the nifH gene (39) ( Table 2 ). The amino acid sequences of the phylotypes (K8MV-C28nifH_03 and K8MV-C28nifH_14) were similar to those of the rhizosphere clones of N044 (ABD74322) (21) and HD3-3 (AAF61006) (20) . The closest nifH gene of the cultivated microorganism was the one from Clostridium acetobutylicum (NP_346894). The phylotype of K8MV-C28nifH_08 was the most closely related to nifH Since all the nifH genes from the cultured microorganisms related to the methane seep group 3 were derived from anaerobic bacteria such as the Clostridia and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, the methane seep group 3 nifH may be derived from the bacterial components of the communities in the methane seep site sediments. (iv) Methane seep group 4. A total of 10 clones (three representative phylotypes) that were phylogenetically affiliated with cluster IV nifH were obtained from the relatively shallower zones (0 to 20 cm bsf) of the microbial mat sediments ( Table 2 and Fig. 1 ). These phylotypes were related to nifH sequences from methanogenic archaea such as Methanococcoides and Methanosarcina members, and the amino acid identity to the several nifH genes from the methanogens was more than 70%. Cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of nif gene cluster (nifH-nifI 1 -nifI 2 -nifD-nifK cluster). Since the nifH was one of the key gene components in microbial nitrogen fixation, we sought to obtain the other genetic components directly from the DNA samples of the sediments to estimate the N 2 -fixing potential of the in situ microbial communities. Several degenerate primers targeting the nif gene cluster including the nifD and nifK genes were constructed based on the multiply aligned sequences of various nifH, nifD, and nifK genes. Finally, a primer set of nifHfw and nifK1rv successfully produced the amplified fragments of the nif gene clusters from the sediments (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). The nifH sequences included in the gene clusters (32 clones of the gene cluster from sediments at various depths) were sequenced. The 32 clones contained two predominant and two less abundant nifH phylotypes, all of which were 100% identical to the nifH clones classified as either methane seep group 2a or 2b obtained from the nifH clone analysis (the phylotype of K8MV-C2nifHK1_08 and K8MV-C2nifHK1_40 was group 2a and the phylotype of K8MV-C2nifHK1_11 was group 2b) ( Table 2) . Thus, we determined the whole sequences of these three predominant types of nif gene clusters. These clones consisted of potential nifH, nifI 1 , nifI 2 , nifD, and nifK genes. These gene structures were found in the typical N 2 -fixing prokaryotes having cluster II or III nifH genes (Fig. 2) . The conserved amino acid residues for the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the nifH coding Fe protein and for the P and MoFe clusters of the nifD coding the MoFe protein were identified in both of the clusters, except for the residue arginine 97 of the Fe protein from K8MV-C2nifHK1_40, whose original residue was cysteine (Fig. 2) . In addition, the phylogenetic analyses of the genetic components (nifI 1 , nifI 2 , and nifD) were conducted by using each of the deduced amino acid sequences (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). These phylogenetic analyses including the nifH tree revealed that some of the gene components of both types were related to the entities of Methanosarcina spp. (nifH and nifI 2 ) ( Fig. 1; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) while some were related to the genes of the Methanococcales members (nifI 1 and nifD) (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). These results suggested that both of the nif gene clusters were derived from the previously unidentified N 2 -fixing archaea phylogenetically associated with the known methanogens. RT-PCR analyses of nifH, nifD, and mcrA in the methane seep sediments. The successful amplification of various types of nifH genes and at least two types of nif gene clusters pointed to the possible expression and operation of these genes and their products in the in situ microbial communities occurring in methane-rich sediments. Thus, the expression of the nifH and nifD genes was examined by RT-PCR using the RNA samples directly extracted from the core sediments. As a control, the expression of the archaeal methanogenic and methantrophic mcrA gene (a gene encoding methyl-coenzyme M reductase ␣ subunit) was checked using the same samples as used for the expression of nif genes. In an examination of the samples without the RT process, no positive fragment was detected in any instance of the amplification of the nifH, nifD, and mcrA genes, indicating that there was negligible DNA contamination in the samples (Fig. 3) . From the cDNA samples at all depths of the core, the expression of mcrA was identified (Fig. 3C) . As described below, as all the mcrA genes obtained from the methane seep sediments were phylogenetically identified as the ones hosted by the ANME, it was demonstrated that the key gene component of AOM was consistently expressed through the depths of the core sediments. In contrast, RT-PCR of the nifH and nifD genes provided the expressed products from the sediments below 10 cm bsf. Although it was not exactly quantified, the fluorescence signatures of the expressed mcrA and the nif genes in the agarose gel electrophoresis were increased with increases in the depth of the sediments. The vertical profile in phylotype composition of the expressed nifH genes is shown in Table 2 . The predominantly expressed nifH gene phylotypes were highly consistent with the predominant phylotypes identified in the nifH clone analysis using the extracted DNA samples ( Table 2) . Two new phylotypes of the nifH genes were found in the RT-PCR clone analysis (K8MV-C26nifHex26 and K8MV-C28nifHex01) (Table 2). The expressed nifH genes were dominated by methane seep group 2, particularly by group 2a, in the sediments (Fig.  3D) . The expressed nifD products were also cloned and sequenced. All the expressed nifD sequences were closely related to the nifD sequences included in the nif gene cluster clones of K8MV-C2nifHK1_08 and K8MV-C2nifHK1_11. However, this was because the RT-PCR primers for the nifD gene were very specific to the sequences of nifD in the clones K8MV-C2nifHK1_08, K8MV-C2nifHK1_40, and K8MV-C2nifHK1_11, which were the only nifD sequences other than those of the known methanogens. In addition, the expression of the methane seep group 3 nifH phylotype was also detected in the deeper zones of the sediments (Table 2) . Concomitant expression of the ANME mcrA and the methane seep group 2 nifH and nifD genes in the methane seep sediments also suggested the possible N 2 -fixing function of the ANME archaea in the deeper zones of the core sediments. Diversity of archaeal 16S rRNA genes and mcrA genes at the Kumano number 8 mud volcano. In order to know what kinds of archaea potentially hosted the operative nif gene components in the anoxic methane seep sediments, archaeal 16S rRNA and mcrA gene clone analyses were conducted. A total of 150 clones of the 16S rRNA genes were sequenced (approximately 940 bp) (see Table S3 and Fig. S3 in the supplemental  material) . At all the depths of the core sediments, the ANME (ANME-1, -2a, -2c, and -3) phylotypes dominated the archaeal 16S RNA gene communities (representing 93% clonal frequency of 150 clones) (see Table S3 and Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Other than the ANME phylotypes, the rRNA gene sequences of the deep-sea archaeal group (marine benthic group B) (43), miscellaneous crenarchaeotic group (16) , and marine benthic group D were detected as minor components in the deeper zones of the sediments, and marine group I phylotypes were found in the surface of the sediments (see Table S3 and Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). None of the rRNA gene sequences related to the known N 2 -fixing methanogens was observed at any depths of the sediments (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Predominance of anoxic methanotrophic archaeal phylotypes was also demonstrated by the mcrA clone analysis (see Table S4 and Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). A total of 67 clones were sequenced, and all the mcrA sequences were associated with potential ANME mcrA genes (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). The most abundantly obtained mcrA phylotypes were classified into group c-d (84% clonal frequency of the total) (11). Other phylogenetic groups of mcrA such as the group a-b (11), group e (11), and group f (19) represent 3%, 9%, and 4% clonal abundance of 67 clones, respectively (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). qPCR analyses. To estimate the depth-dependent distribution and abundance of prokaryotic and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, archaeal nifH and nifD genes, and group-specific mcrA phylotypes, qPCR analyses were conducted with the DNA samples extracted from the core sediments (Fig. 4) . The qPCR methods for the nifH and nifD genes were newly established in this study, and the qPCR techniques for the group-specific mcrA phylotypes were modified from a previously reported method (31) to detect the various mcrA phylotypes obtained in this study. The newly developed techniques provided sensitive and confident quantification statistics when the representative mcrA, nifH, and nifD clones found in this study were used as standards (data not shown). For the qPCR for prokaryotic and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, not only the methane seep sediments but also the reference core sediments were examined (Fig. 4) . The number of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes detected was about 1 order of magnitude higher in the methane seep sediments and than in the reference sediments while the difference in the abundance of archaeal 16S rRNA genes was greater (2 orders of magnitude) than that in the abundance of universal 16S rRNA genes (Fig. 4A) . However, the numbers significantly changed in either case through the depths (Fig.  4A) . These results indicated that the archaeal rRNA gene populations (potentially the archaeal cellular populations) were enriched in the methane-rich sediments. In addition, the mcrA genes of the entire microbial population were also consistently distributed at all the depths of the methane seep sediments (Fig. 4B) . In the shallower zones, a little increase in the mcrA archaeal genes was observed (Fig.  4B ). Among the depth profile patterns of various group-specific mcrA genes, the profile of the group f mcrA gene was very similar to the profile of the mcrA genes of the entire microbial population in the near-surface zones, and the group f mcrA was the most abundant mcrA component in the shallower zones (down to ϳ10 cm bsf) (Fig. 4B) . However, below about 10 cm bsf, the most abundant mcrA population became group c-d mcrA (Fig. 4B) . The number of group c-d mcrA genes was very consistent through the depths (Fig. 4B) . In contrast, the numbers of the group a-b and group e mcrA genes were highly depleted in the surface zones (Fig. 4B) . The depth profiles of the various groups of mcrA genes provided an important insight to elucidating the relevance between the ANME 16S rRNA gene and mcrA phylotypes. It is not yet clear which of the ANME groups (ANME-2a, -2b, -2c, or -3, based on the 16S rRNA gene phylotypes) hosts a specific mcrA phylotype (mcrA group a-b, c-d, e, or f). In the clone analysis and the qPCR experiment of the archaeal 16S rRNA genes, the ANME-3 members were always enriched in the methane seep sediments near the surface while the ANME-2c members showed relatively consistent abundance through the depths (Table 2 and Fig. 4B ). The similarity between the depth-dependent abundance profiles of ANME-3 and mcrA group f phylotypes or of ANME-2c and mcrA group c-d phylotypes may specify the previously unidentified link between the host methanotrophic archaea and their mcrA phylotypes. On the other hand, the distribution and abundance of the nifH and nifD genes were relatively constant through the depths (Fig. 4C) although it was shown by the RT-PCR experiment that the expression levels of both genes were increased with increasing depths of the core (Fig. 3) . The numbers of the nifH and nifD genes were also relatively comparable for the archaeal 16S rRNA genes and the group c-d mcrA. In this study, we obtained multiple lines of evidences that the anoxic methanotrophic microbial communities coupled with sulfate reduction were functionally active and that the potential N 2 fixation could be operated by some of the ANME components in the methane seep sediments of the number 8 Kumano Knoll, the Nankai Trough. Based on the quantitative estimation of archaeal rRNA genes, group-specific mcrA genes, and the methane seep group 2 of nifH-nifD genes in the DNA assemblages obtained from the methane seep sediments, it was suggested that the methane seep group 2 of nifH-nifD components could be hosted by the ANME members that had been classified into the ANME-2c as the 16S rRNA gene phylogroup and were probably linked with the of the mcrA group c-d phylogroup. By the metagenomic analysis and the FISH-SIMS analysis using a 15 N 2 tracer of the anoxic methane-oxidizing microbial communities in the Eel River basin, Pernthaler et al. (37) have suggested that some of the ANME-2c members were capable of operating both AOM and N 2 fixation in the in situ sediments. The anoxic methane-oxidizing consortia magnetically separated by using ANME-2c-specific oligonucleotide probes and enriched with N in the cellular nitrogen possessed the archaeal nifH sequences named BCa2c-nif1g, BCa2c-nif3h, and BCa2c-nif9h (37) . These sequences were closely related to the nifH clones of methane seep group 2a (80 to 90% identity) obtained from the methane seep sediments in the number 8 Kumano Knoll (Fig. 1) . As Pernthaler et al. show that ANME-2 takes up 15 N 2 and that nifH genes were cloned from ANME-2 consortia, the methane seep group 2 of nifH genes (or nifHIDK clusters) are hosted by some members of the ANME-2c. In addition, recently several environmental nifH gene clones that are closely related to our methane seep group 2 nifH gene sequences have been obtained from the deep-sea methane seep sediments in the Sea of Okhotsk (4). Since it has been known that the ANME-2c members are one of the predominant ANME groups distributed in global marine sedimentary environments (17) , the N 2 -fixing potentials of the ANME-2c members would provide a great insight into understanding the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle in the global marine sedimentary environment. N 2 fixation by ANME-2 may also support the syntrophic relationship between ANME-2 and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria. Based on our results found in the methane seep core sediments, it is also suggested that not all the ANME-2c members would adopt the N 2 fixation as their primary nitrogen assimilation mechanism (Fig. 3A and B and Fig. 4 ). In fact, Orphan et al. (36) have recently demonstrated by using FISH-SIMS analysis that the ANME-2 archaea are able to assimilate ammonia and amino acids as the nitrogen sources for protein synthesis. It remains very uncertain whether the N 2 fixation capability of ANME-2c is constrained by the genetic level (e.g., the incidence of the genetic components such as the nifHIDK gene cluster in the genomes), by the expression level (e.g., regulation mechanisms of transcription and expression of the genetic components), or by both with respect to their alternative nitrogen anabolisms. In this study, the qPCR estimation of the nifH-nifD genes demonstrated that the abundance of methane seep group 2 nifH-nifD genes was relatively constant through the depth of the core (Fig. 4C) . The depthdependent distribution pattern and copy number were comparable to those of the archaeal 16S rRNA genes and the group c-d of mcrA (Fig. 4B) . Nevertheless, semiquantitative analysis of nifH-nifD expression by RT-PCR indicated that the methane seep group 2 nifH-nifD genes were more abundantly expressed in the deeper zones of the core sediments than near the seafloor surface although the archaeal methanotrophic mcrA genes were relatively constantly expressed at all depths (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that most of the ANME-2c members may have the potential genetic components of N 2 fixation but could regulate the expression and operation of the N 2 -fixing capability. In the pore water chemistry analysis, the deepest zone of the sediments represented a considerable enrichment of ammonium (Table 1 and Fig. 4F ). The qPCR and the RT-PCR estimations also pointed to the highest abundant occurrence and expression of the methane seep group 2 nifHnifD genes in the deepest core sediments (Fig. 3 and 4C) . The enriched amount of ammonium in the pore water of the deepest core sediments may be accumulated by functions of the actively N 2 -fixing ANME-2c populations. Other than the methane seep group 2, we also obtained several different phylogenetic groups of nifH genes from the methane seep sediments (Table 2 and Fig. 1) . The methane seep group 1 nifH genes were related to cluster II of the nifH genes (39) . The phylogenetic analysis suggests that this group of nifH sequences could be hosted by potential methanogens within the Methanococcales (Fig. 1) (24, 26) . However, the downstream region of this group of nifH genes was not identified from any of the DNA samples in the core sediments, and further clarification was unsuccessful. We also obtained nifH sequences phylogenetically affiliated with cluster III of the nifH genes (39) consisting of the nifH genes from the Firmicutes, Clorobi, and some of the Deltaproteobacteria. This group of nifH sequences was retrieved from the DNA and even cDNA samples taken from the deeper zones of the methane seep sediments. Thus, the host bacteria may be involved in N 2 fixation together with the N 2 -fixing ANME-2c members. Since this group of nifH gene sequences has also been detected from the anoxic methane-oxidizing consortia magnetically separated by using ANME-2c-specific oligonucleotide probes (37) , both the microbial populations in the anoxic methane-oxidizing interdomains (archaeal-bacterial) consortia may be capable of assimilating N 2 as their own nitrogen sources. The cluster IV nifH genes are widely found in many methanogens and even in the methanogens that cannot fix N 2 . Recent investigations have suggested that cluster IV of nifH is not associated with the N 2 -fixing function in the methanogens and may be involved in the biosynthesis of factor 430 (3, 26) . In the hyperthermophilic N 2 -fixing Methanocaldococcus sp. strain FS406-22, only cluster II of nifH was expressed in the cells grown under the N 2 -fixing growth conditions (26) . Thus, cluster IV of nifH obtained from the methane-rich sediments may be independent of the N 2 -fixing potential of the in situ microbial communities. In this study, the potential for microbial nitrogen fixation in the anoxic methane seep sediments in the number 8 Kumano Knoll was explored, and the significance of the ANME-2c archaea in in situ N 2 fixation was clarified. The emerging patterns of different functional genes indicated that the abundance of different groups of ANME archaea is variable at different depths of the sediments, which might be linked with the emerging patterns of different ecophysiological functions including carbon and nitrogen metabolisms in the methane seep sediments. However, it is still completely unknown how much the N 2 fixation of ANME communities supports the biogeochemical nitrogen requirement of the community activities in the in situ environments. A detailed geochemical characterization will be required for not only carbon compounds but also nitrogen compounds such as N 2 , nitrate, nitrous oxide, ammonium, and organic nitrogens in the pore water of the deep-sea sedimentary environments. In addition, compoundspecific stable isotope characterization and tracer experiments using 15 N-labeled substrates will be conducted with a combination of various molecular ecological techniques.",J.

14173406,Detection of methane in the water column at gas and oil seep sites in central and southern Lake Baikal,"Microbiological and biogeochemical investigation of the water column of oligotrophic Lake Baikal at the sites of the K2 and Bolshoy mud volcanoes and the Gorevoy Utes oil seep was carried out in July 2013. Total microbial numbers (TMN), cell numbers of type I and type II methanotrophs, and methane concentrations were measured; the rate of methane oxidation was determined. Methane concentrations in Lake Baikal water column varied from 0.09 to 1 μL/L, while methane oxidation rates varied from 0.007 to 0.9 nL/(L day). The highest rates of methane oxidation were revealed in the near-bottom water horizons at the sites of the Bolshoy mud volcano and the Gorevoy Utes oil seep. These were the sites where the most pronounced anomalies in methane concentration were also detected. TMN varied from 0.123 x 10(6) to 1.64 x 10(6) cells/mL. Methanotrophic bacteria were revealed in the water column at all sites, their abundance did not always correlate with methane concentrationsand the rates of methane oxidation. Methanotrophs constituted not more than 1.63% of the total microbial number, with their highest abundance in the upper 200 m of the water column.",,A.

4395526,Geology and insolation-driven climatic history of Amazonian north polar materials on Mars,"Mariner 9 and Viking spacecraft images revealed that the polar regions of Mars, like those of Earth, record the planet's climate history. However, fundamental uncertainties regarding the materials, features, ages and processes constituting the geologic record remained. Recently acquired Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data and Mars Orbiter Camera high-resolution images from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and moderately high-resolution Thermal Emission Imaging System visible images from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft permit more comprehensive geologic and climatic analyses. Here I map and show the history of geologic materials and features in the north polar region that span the Amazonian period (approximately 3.0 Gyr ago to present). Erosion and redeposition of putative circumpolar mud volcano deposits (formed by eruption of liquefied, fine-grained material) led to the formation of an Early Amazonian polar plateau consisting of dark layered materials. Crater ejecta superposed on pedestals indicate that a thin mantle was present during most of the Amazonian, suggesting generally higher obliquity and insolation conditions at the poles than at present. Brighter polar layered deposits rest unconformably on the dark layers and formed mainly during lower obliquity over the past 4-5 Myr (ref. 20). Finally, the uppermost layers post-date the latest downtrend in obliquity <20,000 years ago.",,Kenneth Tanaka,2005,16222294,10.1038/nature04065
45978787,Characterization of a deep‐sea microbial mat from an active cold seep at the Milano mud volcano in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea,"A white, filamentous microbial mat at the Milano mud volcano in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea was sampled during the Medinaut cruise of the R/V Nadir in 1998. The composition of the mat community was characterized using a combination of phylogenetic and lipid biomarker methods. The mat sample was filtered through 0.2 and 5-μm filters to coarsely separate unicellular and filamentous bacteria. Analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from the total community DNA from these fractions showed that similar archaeal populations were present in both fractions. However, the bacterial populations in the fractions differed from one another, and were more diverse than the archaeal ones. Lipid analysis showed that bacteria were the dominant members of the mat microbial community and the relatively low δ13C carbon isotope values of bulk bacterial lipids suggested the occurrence of methane- and sulfide-based chemo(auto)trophy. Consistent with this, the bacterial populations in the fractions were related to Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria, most of which were chemoautotrophic bacteria that utilize hydrogen sulfide (or reduced sulfur compounds) and/or methane. The most common archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were related to those of previously identified Archaea capable of anaerobic methane oxidation. Although the filamentous organisms observed in the mat were not conclusively identified, our results indicated that the Eastern Mediterranean deep-sea microbial mat community might be sustained on a combination of methane- and sulfide-driven chemotrophy.",N/A,Sander Heijs,2005,16329971,10.1016/j.femsec.2005.02.007

The cells were Gram-negative, motile, short, straight or curved rods with a single polar flagellum. Growth was observed at 5–40 °C (optimum, 30 °C) and pH 5.5–9.5 (optimum, pH 8.0). Growth of strain SN118T was observed in NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 8.0 % (w/v) with an optimum at 2.0–3.0 % (w/v). The isolate grew chemolithoautotrophically with sulfide, elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as electron donor, oxygen, nitrate or nitrite as an electron acceptor and CO2/HCO3 - as a carbon source. Molecular hydrogen or organic substances did not support growth. Nitrate was reduced to N2. The dominant fatty acids were C16 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0 and C18 : 1ω7c. The total size of the genome of the novel isolate was 2 209 279 bp and the genomic DNA G+C content was 38.8 mol%. Results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the novel isolate belonged to the genus Sulfurimonas and was most closely related to Sulfurimonas denitrificans DSM 1251T (96.74 %). Based on its physiological properties and results from phylogenetic analyses, including average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA–DNA hybridization values, the isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Sulfurimonas , for which the name Sulfurimonas crateris sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SN118T (=DSM 109248T=VKM B-3378T).",N/A,N. Ratnikova,2019,31639074,10.1099/ijsem.0.003779
7907279,Colonization of organic substrates deployed in deep-sea reducing habitats by symbiotic species and associated fauna,"Abstract In this study, our goal was to test whether typical vent/seep organisms harbouring symbionts or not, would be able to settle on organic substrates deployed in the vicinity of chemosynthetic ecosystems. Since 2006, a series of novel standardized colonization devices ( CHEMECOLI : CHEM osynthetic E cosystem CO lonization by L arval I nvertebrates) filled with three types of substrates (wood, alfalfa and carbonate) have been deployed in different types of reducing habitats including cold seeps in the eastern Mediterranean, a mud volcano in the Norwegian Sea, and hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge for durations of 2 weeks to 1 year. For all deployments, highest species diversities were recovered from CHEMECOLIs filled with organic substrates. Larvae from species associated with thiotrophic symbionts such as thyasirid, vesicomyid and mytilid bivalves, were recovered in the eastern Mediterranean and at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At the Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano, larvae of symbiotic siboglinids settled on both organic and carbonate substrates. Overall, novel colonization devices (CHEMECOLI) filled with organic substrates attracted both fauna relying on chemosynthesis-derived carbon as well as fauna relying on heterotrophy the latter being opportunistic and tolerant to sulphide."," Deep-sea reducing ecosystems such as methane seeps and hydrothermal vents are 44 sustained by chemosynthetic prokaryotes which use reduced compounds such as sulphide and 45 methane, and produce organic matter from inorganic sources (Van Dover, 2000) . These patchy 46 and ephemeral marine habitats are colonized by symbiotic metazoans species (i.e. metazoans 47 M A N U S C R I P T organisms and macro-fauna respectively. Both use hydrogen sulphide for chemoautotrophy, but 152 siboglinids achieve chemosynthesis through the help of symbionts located within the trophosome 153 (Lösekann et al., 2008) . Colonization devices were deployed by ROV Victor 6000 (Ifremer, 154 France) and recovered by the ROV Quest 4000 (MARUM, Germany) after 12 months (Table 1)  155 in the south Hummocky periphery of the mud volcano where there was generally a high density 156 of siboglinids (>50%) and lower density of Beggiatoa spp. (<20%) (Jerosh et al., 2007) . 157 158 Bathymodiolus Within a few hours of recovery, CHEMECOLIs were sorted on board in a cold room. For 160 each CHEMECOLI, external aspect was recorded and then the top mesh was opened to collect 161 the colonized substrate into a bucket. One fifth of content (or 20 cubes) randomly selected from 162 the bottom, middle and top of the device, was fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde in twice-163 filtered seawater (TFSW), 2/5 (or 40 cubes) were fixed in 95% ethanol, 1/5 (or 20 cubes) was 164 fixed for Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses (4% buffered formaldehyde in 165 TFSW for few hours at 4°C, rinsed three times in TFSW then transferred into 50/50 166 Ethanol/TFSW and stored in 95% ethanol), the rest was shared between frozen in 10% glycerolM A N U S C R I P T 8 or/and fixed in buffered 2.5% Glutaraldehyde. Once sorting was completed, the medium in 168 which cubes were sorted was filtered through a 64-µm mesh to recover small fauna that was not 169 attached to substrates, and fixed either in formaldehyde, ethanol, FISH, frozen or Glutaraldehyde. 170 If organisms had settled outside the device, they were fixed but not included in further analyses. 171 All species fixed in buffered formaldehyde were morphologically identified using a dissecting 172 microscope. Wood cubes were dissected in thin slices using wood dissecting scissors in order to 173 collect endofauna. For alfalfa, each piece of grass was examined including the inside of the grass 174 itself. For carbonate cubes, only external observation was carried out. Specimens were counted, 175 identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, and pictures were taken. Some specimens from 176 the dominant fauna such as polychaetes and molluscs were sent to taxonomists for species 177 identification. Some species recovered from substrates fixed in formaldehyde from 178 CHEMECOLIs deployed at the Nile Deep-Sea Fan and HMMV, were also recovered from 179 substrates fixed in ethanol and used for molecular-based identification using marker genes such 180 as COI and 18S rRNA (see below). 181 182 2.4 COI and 18S rRNA genes sequencing 183 DNA was extracted from soft-tissues of some specimens recovered from CHEMECOLIs 184 deployed at the Nile Deep-Sea Fan (Table 2 ) and of polychaetes recovered from CHEMECOLIs 185 deployed at HMMV, using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's 186 protocol. Fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I-encoding gene (COImt DNA) 187 were amplified using primers LCO 1490 and HCO 2198 (Folmer et al., 1994) . Polymerase Chain 188 Reaction (PCR) was performed as follows: an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 94°C, followed 189 by 35 cycles at 94°C for 30s, 48°C for 40s for hybridization, then 1 min at 72°C, and a final 190 extension for 10 min at 72°C. PCR products were sequenced by Genoscope (France). 191 Alternatively, a ~1800 bp fragment of the18S rRNA gene was amplified with primers 1f andM A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9 2023r (Pradillon et al., 2007) using Ex Taq PCR kit (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) and the following 193 PCR protocol: initial denaturation at 96ºC for 5 min, 30 cycles of (96ºC for 1 min, 51ºC for 1 194 min, and 72ºC for 3 min) and a final extension at 72ºC for 10 min. Amplification products were 195 purified using gel extraction following the manufacturer's protocol (Wizard kit Promega). 196 Sequencing reactions using the PCR products as template were performed with BigDye 197 Terminator Cycling Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 198 USA), in both directions, using additional internal primers (see Pradillon et al., 2007) . Overall, a total of 33 taxa were recovered from all CHEMECOLIs deployed in the three 254 study areas hosting reducing habitats. Main groups recovered were Mollusca (bivalves and 255 gastropods) and Annelida (polychaetes), followed by Arthropod Crustacean, Nemertea, 256 Sipuncula, Foraminifera, Actinopodia and Echinoderma (Table 3) . Species recovered varied 257 among study sites, but also among the different CHEMECOLI substrates deployed within a 258 given study site (Table 3) . For both the Rainbow and the Nile Deep-sea Fan 1-year experiments, 259 more than 50% of the species encountered within both organic and carbonate substrates were not 260 previously reported in the surrounding chemosynthetic communities. In the HMMV experiment, 261 only 30% of the fauna recovered from CHEMECOLIs was not documented in the surrounding 262 habitat. Overall densities of specimens (Table 3) were the highest for organic substrates and 263 especially for the wood substrate, reaching 14,987.5 specimens per dm 3 in the CHEMECOLI 264 deployed at HMMV due to the high number of wood-borers that colonized a cube (~117 265 specimens). 266 M A N U S C R I P T Mollusc dominated as colonists within CHEMECOLIs deployed for 2-weeks and 1-year 267 experiments at the Nile Deep-Sea Fan (Fig. 4a) were also present on organic substrates in the long-term experiment. Carbonate substrates 275 deployed for one year were colonized only by low densities of gastropods Clelandella myriamae, 276 hesionid polychaetes and sipuncle (Table 3) . Young settler-stages (juveniles) of symbiotic 277 bivalve species harbouring sulphur-oxidizing bacteria were successfully recovered. These 278 included Idas sp., Vesicomyid sp. and Thyasira sp. (Fig. 5a ). These three species were all 279 recovered within the wood substrate after the two-weeks and after the one-year experiments. Idas 280 sp. was also recovered in the alfalfa substrate after the one-year experiment (Fig. 5a) . 281 CHEMECOLIs recovered after one year at the Rainbow site, were poorly colonized 282 compared to CHEMECOLIs deployed into cold seep habitats for one year. Wood-boring bivalves 283 (Xylophaga atlantica (H.G. Richards, 1942)) dominated in the wood-containing device, and 284 juveniles of symbiotic bivalves were also recovered (~200 specimens per dm 3 , Table 3 , Fig. 5b ) 285 similar morphologically to vesicomyid juveniles, however a molecular identification is necessary 286 to ascertain this observation such as ISH (see introduction). Some polychaetes (Prionospio sp. 287 nov. 3, ~40 specimens per dm 3 ) were recovered within both wood and alfalfa substrates (Fig. 4b) . 288 CHEMECOLIs deployed for one year at the HMMV were densely colonized, especially 289 the wood and alfalfa substrates (Fig. 4c) . Wood-boring bivalves (Xyloredo ingolfia (Turner, 290 1972)) were dominant in the wood substrate reaching the highest density documented in our 291 . Polychaetes occurred on all substrates, more 293 abundant on the wood (400 specimen per dm 3 ) but were as well present in high densities in 294 alfalfa and carbonate substrates (>100 specimens per dm 3 ). Juveniles of the chemosymbiotic 295 species Sclerolinum contortum (Fig. 5c ) were recovered inside all three CHEMECOLIs, 296 displaying tube lengths ranging from few mms to few cms (Table 3) . Adult siboglinid tubeworms 297 were attached to the outside mesh of each colonization device that was in contact with the soft 298 sediment (but not counted as not within the mesh). Among crustaceans (Fig. 4c ), amphipods and 299 copepods occurred on wood and alfalfa substrates, while Metacaprella sp. occurred on all three 300 substrates (Table 3) . 301 Species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') and Pielou's evenness (J') indices 302 differed among substrates at all deployment sites (Table 4) . No statistical support can be 303 summoned due to the lack of replicates, however for each study site, S and H' were the highest 304 for wood and alfalfa substrates compared to carbonate substrates, except for the wood substrate 305 in HMMV where the species richness is the highest but Shannon-Wiener diversity index is very 306 low due to the dominance of the species Xyloredo ingolfia that gives an equitability of 0.1 (J'). 307 308 In situ punctual sulphide measurements on colonization devices after one year 310 deployment at the Nile Deep-Sea Fan did not reveal any sulphide enrichment in their immediate 311 surrounding before recovery (data not shown). Yet very low sulphide levels, micromolar to 312 submicromolar in alfalfa and wood respectively, were detected inside the devices after recovery 313 suggesting that sulphide had been produced (Table 5) . Measurement in the immediate vicinity 314 (<1 m from colonization device) conversely revealed that local free sulphide enrichment could be 315 detected in the cracks of the underlying carbonate pavement (data not shown). Sulphide was 316 however not detected in the water above these cracks. 317 At the Rainbow hydrothermal vent, no free sulphide was detected in situ at the top, side 318 or basis of the devices. On board, neither the alfalfa pieces, nor the wood cube devices displayed 319 significant sulphide enrichment when the electrodes were inserted deeper inside. Compared to 320 Nile deep-sea fan, the situation is however quite different in Rainbow since free sulphide is also 321 extremely low even in the habitat of Bathymodiolus mussels or shrimps in the immediate vicinity 322 of the venting chimneys. 323 324 The goal of this study was to test whether organic substrates within CHEMECOLIs 326 supported the colonization of marine invertebrates' endemic from geologically-driven reducing 327 habitats such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, and to test whether larvae of symbiont-328 bearing metazoans were able to settle on these substrates hence potentially use them as stepping-329 stones for dispersal. For both questions we can respond positively. 330 characteristic of sulphidic habitats suggests that the presence of these species is not necessarily 496 related to high sulphide content. Two hypotheses can be proposed to explain this result: 1) the 497 microenvironment has been enriched to a larger extent over a limited period of time preceding 498 the recovery and colonizers still reflect these earlier sulphide-enriched stages; 2) sulphide 499 production by SRB is just starting and thiotrophic species settlement is triggered by indirect clues 500 correlated to sulphide production, such as compounds produced by cellulose-degrading bacteria. 501 This stresses the need for a better characterisation of the variability of physico-chemical 502 conditions over time in future sunken wood deep-sea experiments. The fact that taxa such as 503 thyasirid, vesicomyid and mytilid bivalves were already recovered after 2 weeks in the Nile 504 Deep-Sea Fan wood experiment, whereas these species were absent from the carbonate 505 colonization device, supports the latter hypothesis. However, the idea that the presence of 506 organic matter is the only factor triggering the settlement of these species should be taken with 507 caution since methane, and even sulphide enrichment in the local environment can not be 508  This simple, standardized, colonization device, CHEMECOLI, was designed to recover young 514 stages of endemic fauna from reducing habitats and to study colonization processes in the 515 absence of large predators. Overall, colonization devices deployed at the Nile Deep-Sea Fan, 516 HMMV, and Rainbow were mostly colonized by molluscs (gastropods or bivalves) and annelid 517 (polychaetes), and juvenile stages were successfully recovered. Organic substrates were more 518 densely colonized than the carbonate substrate. Wood-boring bivalves were found on every wood 519 substrate at all sites, although with different species. Organic substrates yielded several species 520 presumably harbouring chemosynthetic bacterial symbionts, as well as associated heterotrophic 521 fauna common at hot vents, methane seeps and organic falls and tolerant to sulphide. Species that 522 were not previously reported in these reducing habitats, but that were common in other type of 523 reducing habitats, were also present. ",S.M.

The type strain of Lutibaculum baratangense is AMV1 T (5KCTC 22669 T 5NBRC T 5CCUG 58046 T ). Mud volcanoes/cold seeps are a natural source of methane (Niemann et al., 2006) . Methanotrophic bacteria and archaea are predominantly found in these habitats (Niemann et al., 2006) . Apart from Beggiatoa and Thiomargarita, which use oxygen or nitrate for respiration (Omoregie et al., 2008) , other sulfide-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the class Epsilonproteobacteria are found in cold seep systems (Campbell et al., 2006) . A few novel bacterial species reported from these habitats include Altererythrobacter epoxidivorans, Cupriavidus pinatubonensis, Cupriavidus laharis, Halobacillus profundi, Halobacillus kuroshimensis, 'Marinobacter alkaliphilus' and Sulfurovum lithotrophicum (Hua et al., 2007; Inagaki et al., 2004; Kwon et al., 2007; Sato et al., 2006; Takai et al., 2005) . The order Rhizobiales is a phenotypically and phylogenetically diverse group within the a-2 subgroup of the Proteobacteria (Woese et al., 1984; Kuykendall, 2005) . At the time of writing, it comprises 13 families, Aurantimonadaceae, Bartonellaceae, Beijerinckiaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Brucellaceae, Cohaesibacteraceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, Methylocystaceae, Methylobacteriaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Rhodobiaceae and Xanthobacteraceae. The order Rhizobiales also includes strains such as those in Amorphus coralli (Zeevi Ben Yosef et al., 2008) , Bauldia consociata and Bauldia litoralis (Yee et al., 2010) , Pleomorphomonas oryzae (Xie & Yokota, 2005) and Martelella mediterranea (Rivas et al., 2005) which do not belong to any of the above families. In the present study, based on a polyphasic taxonomic approach (Vandamme et al., 1996) , a strain isolated from a mud volcano (AMV1   T   ) is assigned to a new genus of the family Rhodobiaceae. T was isolated from a soil sample collected from a mud volcano of Baratang Island, Middle Andamans, India, on 20 February 2009. The sample that yielded strain AMV1 T had a pH of 7.5. For isolation of bacteria, 100 mg of the soil sample was suspended in 1 % saline water and plated on Zobell's marine agar medium (Zobell, 1941) and incubated at room temperature for 15 days. Based on colony morphology, a pale orangepigmented colony was selected and characterized in the present study. (Srinivas et al., 2007) . Motility was assessed on trypticase soy agar (TSA) [containing (l 21 ) pancreatic digest of casein (17 g), papaic digest of soyabean meat (3 g), NaCl (5 g), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (2.5 g), glucose (2.5 g) and agar (0.4 g)] and also by light microscopy (Reddy et al., 2008) . Growth at 4, 10, 18, 25, 30, 37 and 40 u C and with 0 (without NaCl), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 % (w/v) NaCl, biochemical characteristics, carbon source assimilation, H 2 S production and sensitivity to 32 different antibiotics (HiMedia) were determined according to the methods of Lányí (1987) and Smibert & Krieg (1994) . Biochemical characteristics were confirmed by using a Hi25 Enterobacteriaceae identification kit (cat. no. KB003) and the HiCarbohydrate kit parts A, B and C (cat. no. KB009; HiMedia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Growth of strain AMV1 T at pH 5, 6, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11 and 12 was assessed on TSA buffered with citric acid/NaOH (for pH 5 and 6), phosphate (for pH 7 and 8), glycine/NaOH (for pH 9 and 10) or Tris (for pH 11 and 12). The phenotypic characteristics of strain AMV1 T are listed in the species description below and in Table 1 . For pigment extraction, 2 ml of an exponential phase culture grown on Zobell's marine broth was centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, 2 ml ethanol was added and mixed thoroughly on a vortex mixer; following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. The absorption spectrum was measured at 300-800 nm on a Lambda 35 spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) with either acetone or ethanol as a blank. For cellular fatty acids analysis, strain AMV1 T and Amorphus coralli DSM 19760 T were grown in TSA plates at 30 u C for 48 h. Standardization of the physiological age of these two strains was done based on the protocol given by the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI; http://www.microbialid.com/PDF/TechNote_101.pdf). Cellular fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from cells by saponification, methylation and extraction following the MIDI protocol. Cellular fatty acid methyl esters were separated by GC (6850) and identified and qualified with MIDI System software (version 6.0, by using the aerobe RTSBA6 method and RTSBA6 database). Polar lipids were extracted following the method of Bligh & Dyer (1959) and analysed by two-dimensional TLC followed by spraying with appropriate detection reagents (Komagata & Suzuki, 1987) . Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidyinositol, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were used as standards for two-dimensional TLC. Total lipids were detected by staining with molybdophosphoric acid. Ubiquinones were extracted as described by Collins et al. (1977) and analysed by HPLC (Groth et al., 1997) . Ubiquinones and polar lipids were analysed on freeze-dried cells. DNA was isolated according to the procedure of Marmur (1961) and the G+C content was determined from melting point (T m ) curves (Sly et al., 1986) obtained by using a Lambda 2 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer) equipped with the Templab 2.0 software package (Perkin Elmer). Escherichia coli DNA was used as a standard in determining the DNA G+C content. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, DNA was prepared by using a microbial DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories) and sequenced as described by Lane (1991) . The resultant almost-complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was 1455 nt. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the new isolate was subjected to BLAST sequence similarity searches (Altschul et al., 1990) and the EzTaxon server (Chun et al., 2007) was used to identify the nearest taxa. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type species of different families in the order Rhizobiales and unclassified taxa of the order Rhizobiales were downloaded from the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); these were aligned by using the CLUSTAL X program (Thompson et al., 1997) and the alignment was then corrected manually. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the maximumlikelihood method and neighbour-joining (Saitou & Nei, 1987) tree-making algorithms, by using the PhyML program (Guindon et al., 2005) and MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007) , respectively. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches (Felsenstein, 1993) . Pair-wise evolutionary distances were computed by using the DNADIST program with Kimura's two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) . Based on colony morphology, four unique morphotypes were selected and sequenced (16S rRNA genes). Based on BLAST searches, strains AMV1 T , AMV17, AMV18 and AMV19 were phylogenetically close to the type strains of Tepidamorphus gemmatus (95.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Erythrobacter gaetbuli (100 %), Loktanella hongkongensis (98.5 %) and Pontibacter korlensis (98.2 %), respectively. Strain AMV1 T , which differed from its nearest phylogenetic neighbour by 5.0 % at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level, was selected for further characterization. Cells of strain AMV1 T were Gram-negative, oval to rodshaped, multiplied by binary fission and were motile (Fig.  S1 , available in IJSEM Online). Colonies on marine agar were pale orange, circular, 2-4 mm in diameter and convex with entire margins. Cells grew at 25-37 u C (optimum 30-37 u C) and were able to tolerate up to 4 % (w/v) NaCl. The total lipids comprised DPG, PG, PE, three unidentified lipids (UL1-UL3), one unidentified phospholipid (PL3) and one unidentified aminolipid (AL) (Fig. S2) . Amorphus coralli DSM 19760 T contained DPG, PG, PE, two unidentified phospholipids (PL1 and PL2) and one unidentified AL (Fig. S2) . Taxa belonging to the order Rhizobiales normally possess a number of polar lipids, such as PS, PC, PG, DPG, bisphosphatidylglycerol, PE, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and aminophospholipids, together with unidentified phospholipids, glycolipids and ALs, and unidentified lipids (Hwang & Cho, 2008) . Strain AMV1 T contained ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as the major respiratory quinone and minor quantities of ubiquinone-9 (Q-9), thus resembling Amorphus coralli DSM 19760 T . The other characteristics of strain AMV1 T are listed in the species description below and in Table 2 . The predominant fatty acids found in strain AMV1 T were C 16 : 0 (5.7 %), C 18 : 1 v7c (78.6 %) and C 19 : 0 cyclo v8c (6.3 %) ( members of the order Rhizobiales (class Alphaproteobacteria), with pairwise sequence similarities of 95.0, 94.5, 94.4 and 94.0 %, respectively, and of ,94 % with all other members of the order Rhizobiales (Fig. S3 ). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain AMV1 T clustered with four uncultured clone sequences and Tepidamorphus gemmatus (a member of the family Rhodobiaceae) at phylogenetic distances of 6.6-9.1 and 7 % (93.4-90.9 and 93 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), respectively, which together clustered with species of the genera Afifella, Amorphus and Rhodobium but branched separately from species of the genus Bauldia at phylogenetic distances of 10.9, 10-10.3, 9.1 and 10. 5-10.6 % (89.1, 90-89.7, 90.9, 89.5-89 .4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), respectively, and was distantly related to other members of the order Rhizobiales (Fig. 1) . T could also be phenotypically differentiated from Amorphus coralli DSM 19760 T , Tepidamorphus gemmatus CB-27A T , Rhodobium orientis DSM 11290 T and Afifella pfennigii DSM 17143 T (Table 1) based on morphological, physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic features (Table 1) . Strain AMV1 T could also be distinguished phylogenetically from the type strains of Bauldia consociata and Bauldia litoralis (Fig. 1) based on physiological characteristics such as cell shape, absence of prosthecae, presence of motility, utilization of different carbon sources, colony colour and higher DNA G+C content. The cumulative differences that strain AMV1 T exhibits with members of the above genera unambiguously suggest that strain AMV1 T is a representative of a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Lutibaculum baratangense gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. Description of Lutibaculum gen. nov. Lutibaculum (lu.ti.ba9cu.lum. L. n. lutum mud; L. neut. n. baculum rod; N.L. neut. n. Lutibaculum rod from mud).
